28 @-@ year @-@ old Koch found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother testified that he could not imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , it went uphill with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the corp@@ se found on Wednesday morning at West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , and informed the Department of Ophthal@@ m@@ ology in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations are ongoing .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , told the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had his dream job as a chef at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed on the ground &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him sor@@ ely , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and our con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gali@@ cia admitted that Frank lived at host@@ els first , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment he had a girlfriend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said he could not imagine anyone who would hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly man with a big heart .
combining his way with his family was to always cook something for us , to prepare dinner , &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia .
he never wanted to participate in any kind of debate .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the stream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond , who sh@@ one bri@@ ghtly every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information on the case is asked to call the SF@@ PD &apos;s critic at number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always in a drawer
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston doesn &apos;t always have to be perfect or successful .
in an interview the Hollywood star has clearly made this clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always get stuck in drawers or past@@ ed from the outside label , which have little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are rather dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan . &quot;
the act@@ ress loves to spend her time at home , in front of a television with a lo@@ vel@@ ess de@@ br@@ is and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she brings the question about the desire for children : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new movie &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not Child &apos;s Play &quot; is Ani@@ ston as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us from August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger wins the Sports Py@@ ramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger , with some colleagues , was looking for a little variation with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden Sports Py@@ ramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their holidays , they drove home to feed @-@ trou@@ ghs in fast gal@@ lo@@ ping .
one kilometer at this speed , I was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it wasn &apos;t a good experience , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and with that the riding career ended again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses .
he let himself be led with his family via the system of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even sw@@ am for photo purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CH@@ IO .
the reason was absolutely convincing .
the German sport aid presented the man from An@@ hausen in the framework of a small gala , the Golden sport pyramid .
there is no lack of awards to the symp@@ athetic athlete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes Lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has pla@@ gu@@ ed him .
the 18th winner of the Py@@ ramid of Sports is long .
in Aachen he met the first winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only awarded for athle@@ tic success but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting young talents .
and so he announced the prize money of 25,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time US master winner was included in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the award @-@ winning athletes are the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the leader Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the show jum@@ per Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ous the Hand@@ bar Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company moved to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza price ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept the distance to the big animals .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp Economic Policy in a Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing the trade agreement T@@ TP - this is what Clinton and Tru@@ mp want .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are in favour of fiscal and energy policies as well as a fundamental issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the difference in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical difference .
that , on the role of the state .
Tru@@ mp wants to keep the doubts rather small and cau@@ tions how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regul@@ ators .
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to regulate it to death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , asser@@ ts Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely re@@ tract regul@@ ators , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton on the other hand says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state has to fulfil certain tasks , it has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities to open up and needs money for it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why taxes for the rich would increase , she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
in the future , we need to invest , say Tru@@ mp and Clinton almost verb@@ ati@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic candidate has even announced the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War . &quot; &quot; &quot;
government investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ ach@@ y wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
so there could be party internal discussions on Tru@@ mp .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive coal mining in the US again .
oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas ; it wants to termin@@ ate the Paris climate agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton on the other hand wants to explicitly expand renewable energies with its investment programme : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - also in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not far from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ acific agreement , both do not want to sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , both of them do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply want to protect American jobs better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Baker &amp; Mc@@ K@@ enz@@ ie Firm of the Year for Banking and Finance
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 was a famine .
it wants to raise it to $ 15 per hour .
what Tru@@ mp wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be r@@ ushed , then he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on one hand , Tru@@ mp wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics cont@@ end him so that the budget deficit would only be even greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is a part of everyday life for women who flee alone .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby that is at most a year old .
one woman laid her little son in her arms .
he looks curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the Business Manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a suppor@@ ter of social aid services in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the topic women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few de@@ central accommodations for all @-@ blown women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs developed the institution with Pro Famili@@ a and the Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
recently it has been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - even not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every woman who comes here has experiences on her flight experience with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of war because they are persecuted politically , because torture or death threaten them or because their families send them to Europe as hope @-@ makers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly , because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honor murder , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is what drives them away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , that tu@@ gs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who believe that the end , as soon as they come to Germany , mis@@ lead us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be regarded as inferior and ab@@ used in the worst case .
this leads to the fact that about 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumati@@ zed , they appreciate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children have certainly not volunte@@ ered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so used to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about what they have experienced , because shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , it requires more accommodations just for them , demands B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their sphere of responsibility , some respond with no .
in Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , for example , there is no such thing in government housing .
even in Schw@@ aben alone fled women are not accommodated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia there are floors or own homes for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodation available exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender Equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Committee also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are har@@ assed separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lacks privacy , or if men and women are accommodated together , it can be - perpet@@ ual violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is available in the study .
how much women feel this need of protection can be read at the rush that the house is located in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been around for us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily open a second house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistant doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : demands for new work combat measures &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of the assistance physicians have called their union to appro@@ ve new work campaigns in their disputes regarding a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more activities from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers failed to respond to concerns about the contract .
in July , assistants and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members published on Twitter Thursday evening , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; would have stayed with problems , which led to the rejection of the Treaty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Executive Committee voted to fully reject the proposed new treaty and solic@@ it official new negotiations on all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today submitted a formal request to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating labour campaign measures beginning in September .
the disputes led to assistance doctors struck six times this year , the first total out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A Regi@@ stra@@ ints Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed terms and conditions recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which were held before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistant doctors and medical students , that the contract should be advantageous and should be adopted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for physicians in England would be enforced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight month @-@ long war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ parts in the gil@@ ded hall of the St. Petersburg palace , I cannot deny myself the impression that Ankara will most want this reconciliation .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s sm@@ iles seemed nar@@ row@@ ly and he barely radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan on the other hand spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but can even be improved .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved as if there had never been anything worse .
it seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed to show the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radiant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had not forgotten anything .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his introductory remarks : the down@@ fall of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was angry .
Putin shared and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia .
the off@@ ence was even greater , as it was committed by a supposed friend .
building the c@@ ous@@ ins again becomes difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months the state controlled media launched a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
the most serious accus@@ ations were the alle@@ gations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had prof@@ ited from illegal oil trade in Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St. Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin was ap@@ ologi@@ zed by President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear .
Russia could make a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the benefits of a tru@@ ce stand clear on the hand .
Erdo@@ gan is first of all needed all the friends he can get after having been dismissed last month in a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat of almost his am@@ nesty .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - notably the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late @-@ season rush to the Mediterranean .
this week , the state television projected cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious on the West as it regards its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response .
in addition , the ongoing res@@ ent@@ ment on the slu@@ g pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is keen to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West .
in Ankara , the Russian head of state won with certainty that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
the summit in this splendid palace at the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that feel alien@@ ated from the West and feel ill @-@ treated and now unite .
nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played its role as a peac@@ em@@ aker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents said at the press conference that they didn &apos;t even grasp the subject .
the president of Turkey pur@@ pos@@ efully refra@@ ined from answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise this .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster , when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State are talking at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
according to the Bank Chief Executive Board , the R@@ BS brand will only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan announced the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was associated with the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself from having almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to put more national brands into focus .
Scotland &apos;s Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the de@@ central headquarters and the stock exchange noti@@ fications go to Nat@@ west .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for private customer business that will get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and staff in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our Invest@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed as we now become more of a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals .
each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already stated that it will no longer carry out its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sports sponsorship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to become a bank of brands , because how do we focus internally ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori achieves its 3,@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne after a double at New@@ market , who brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th win
Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British prize in New@@ market on Friday .
he sat on Pre@@ dile@@ ction , which was trained by John Gos@@ den , a milestone on his local race track with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey which reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the triple winner D@@ ett@@ ori who was in front of G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I ended up here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori picks up the che@@ er when he gets the victory on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who achieved over 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career impressions
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern times and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone , which few reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect , which distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a have been enthusiastic fans for many years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already gotten 6.000 list@@ ings if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already won almost 30 years winner in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible ho@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ mounting , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fi@@ gu@@ re@@ head of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a prohibition of drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago , he had difficulties at the beginning when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his burial .
and he is not at the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori has once said that he wants to continue with cont@@ ests up to his age of at least 5@@ 0.@@ ths of age .

Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expect@@ edly dismissed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .

the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed UN Special Represent@@ ative for the Environment and Transport Affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin it is that without giving reasons , Putin ordered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ miss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been a proxy since 2012 , has been appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at .
born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated at the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ K@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it says ( in Russian ) that he was later a protocol leader and chief of staff of the government staff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin on his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your activity as head of state regarding bills of bills and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
do the smiling faces convince ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was , for a long time , one of the closest confi@@ dences of Vladimir Putin and works as he for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , broadcast on television , both men claimed that the chief of staff reti@@ res at his own request .
but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , only a few are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows at this time .
but the official statement - that a man who was once praised as a potential president , at one time would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , this very complicated post - you could almost say - to entr@@ ust obj@@ ection@@ able posts for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V adopted the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov one of five people he trusted the most .
once it was assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term of office , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia , as a third term of Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another ally close ally of Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced in a joint statement his resignation .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before announ@@ cing his resignation .
on the set there were artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how Gib@@ son &apos;s character from the series follows a team of FBI agents is expected to be published at a later date , according to ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been involved since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love criminal min@@ ds and have put my entire lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od in the past twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that will no longer be possible .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series .
the planned eman@@ ation of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
ri@@ ddle around fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
one of Ban@@ ff &apos;s residents called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish could be sand @-@ whales , which were sp@@ iced out by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ ferry crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings to the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; approaching completion for each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 hel@@ ical ropes .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister Keith Brown now visited the construction site a visit today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment in building the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the total deck level is at its place and the last section of the deck is now getting a final shot for the deck in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors , said : &quot; the first fast@@ ener represents a significant milestone in each bridge project .
in this fantastic project , the closure is a forward @-@ looking construction and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower on the north tower , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or the north side .
this was reached by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive as the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 meters long , weighs approx . 6.000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of approx . 3 % .
delicate as the toler@@ ances , on which the team worked , were tiny - on each side they only entered a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; rescue at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men still have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men still have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were cast by their fishing boat before Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station was alert on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alert after a crew observed the event at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved on from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and made us worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds ble@@ w the boat out of their reach , until we let water flow , &quot; he added .
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the sea rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water are lucky and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had a emergency stop , but the boat was released from the person who was steering the boat .
today , someone watches over these men .
seriously injured - man li@@ stens to his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked and seriously injured his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg .
as the police told yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the keys to the apartment to get his personal things .
instead , the alcohol @-@ sty@@ led perpetr@@ ator sh@@ rou@@ ded the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by hand and body .
the police were able to arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother .
this then al@@ er@@ ted his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not persu@@ ade him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street they met the ex @-@ wife of the man .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds cheap apartments from Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens say : investors should in future be taken into account much more strongly in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plan of action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next council meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but stri@@ fe is programmed .
first and foremost , the question is : who should build the cheap apartments ?
so far , a regulation is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : those who want to build on urban areas must in future show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments , however , can also be found in the stocks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the big issue in the town hall is , however , so viol@@ a : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors on such areas to build at least 10 percent , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing construction programme , which will cost millions and is still to be financed , should provide incentives for incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem is so viol@@ a : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no agreement between the fac@@ tions at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make as few rules as possible to investors .
the left wants even harder print runs for investors .
despite this , as viol@@ a , it is a sharpen@@ ing of the situation in the housing market .
if the concept of action is implemented , this will take care of additional tasks in the construction management .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program is not yet complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you compensate for the loss of other 1300 cheap apartments , whose promotion will exp@@ ire in the next few years ?
only by 2020 there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , so the budget@@ ary spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , should now be bu@@ ys out b@@ ind@@ ings from the city .
in addition , it would have to be remembered to bring apartments back to the price binding .
this is possible in the west city .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
because in the west city , dates go out at the end of the year .
some 1800 apartments could be retri@@ eved there in the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing associations .
if the number of social dwell@@ ings in the Western city is increased dr@@ astically , they are removed from the aim of so @-@ called mixing .
there should not be a concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke comments : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has focused on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not yet be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a ch@@ ase for health and happiness that is worth it
it is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
that teen@@ age and child are no longer going outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time star@@ ing on screens , has been mour@@ ned by many in the last decade .
with Pok@@ emon Go it &apos;s about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to TV , then to video games and last on smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs were created ) .
like many phenom@@ en@@ ons of pop culture , interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined slightly early in July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand the servers over@@ loaded .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pok@@ é@@ mon that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they were found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the train and jumped for the sofa .
in the US the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person puts back every day .
Cardi@@ ogra@@ m , an app for Apple Watch , who pursu@@ es 35@@ ,000 users , recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game , the number of follow @-@ up people who train every day 30 minutes , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely looks the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns on the health that people want &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coming from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came on deaf ears because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look poor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated .
anyone driving sports regularly reduces its chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as usual , there are also gru@@ elling worms that always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what should it be ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has made a breakthrough . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even if Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit were able to track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will fade with time .
however , due to poker success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the ladies urine
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bal@@ es is immune to all that .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breath@@ tak@@ ingly on the floor .
totally brilliant .
and now finally the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast explained on Thursday to the multi @-@ campaign title and enlarged the gap between herself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and Final Five &quot; team cam@@ er@@ adi@@ n A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ a .
the American women Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the Swedish beam during the single multi @-@ campaign engagement of women in the gymn@@ asti@@ cs at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who wins a multi @-@ battle champion and , in all , the fifth , while consoli@@ dating their reputation , the best of their generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who have brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years of its sport , 15 world championship med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u rescu@@ on from her said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it was expected to be a final exam in Brazil , a competition which did not go so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered as disappointment .
the Americans Simone Bal@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ dd@@ led themselves after winning gold and silver in the single multi @-@ campaign of women in the gymn@@ asti@@ cs tournament in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while at the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i served as ex@@ clamation .
although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted on not having planned the future during their long journey , it is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which include their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no accident .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school trip to the gym in which Bo@@ or@@ man exercised , became a force .
since summer 2013 , she has not lost any competition competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will last as long as it wishes .
even if Mu@@ staf@@ a led through two turns , the picture was dec@@ ep@@ tive .
floating beams and dent@@ ures - in which Bil@@ es holds the World Championship title .
she again picked up again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the bri@@ dal beam - and placed another on the floor with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently as she expected her grand@@ son - pure form@@ ality - and tears f@@ lowed bright red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal went to Mu@@ staf@@ a in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man @-@ captain , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after practicing K@@ us@@ sh@@ ausen , she over@@ came the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as far as Bil@@ es is concerned , the rapidly spreading ts@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a completely new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims in series mur@@ der@@ ers shot at the music hearing in the car
according to police reports released on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl was shot dead in one of the most le@@ thal attacks since a decade in the first serial killer hit by Phoenix , while chat@@ ting in the car and listening to music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June while the car was par@@ ked while driving , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a fire@@ arm while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police told that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder didn &apos;t seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y over@@ throwing because the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
the polic@@ eman of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting has led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they are linked to four previous attacks .
a total of seven people were killed in h@@ is@@ panic residential areas within four months and two more were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s happening in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Howard de K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , announced the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown nut@@ shell from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized because of her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the sho@@ ot@@ ings aimed at an empty pick @-@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and from which it was assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridges and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 year old with a micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it gets better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the f@@ ew@@ est of his associates , Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to did not know during her pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought was , I don &apos;t manage that .
I don &apos;t make it .
I didn &apos;t let myself go on that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is not right at all -- of course you let yourself be taken into it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and you were told that Ed@@ mund may never be able to recognize them and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund is able to walk with help .
Ed@@ mund was unable to sit nor craw@@ l up to his age of 3 and he still cannot speak .
but it is slow to progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing me something &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we teach him sign language , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical sign language -- says it . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters on his own .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as well as in Ed@@ mund and infection with viruses such as meas@@ les or the ci@@ ch@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of those infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the forecast for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect that anyone can really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
they know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives rise to b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy ra@@ ins and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on the emergency stand on Friday . it is expected all Saturday with more rainf@@ alls .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded their banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards has shared that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the move to the communities concerned .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , said that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that the community of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa alone would have requested ten thousand sand bags .
a floo@@ ding warning system is used for large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service stipul@@ ated that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood early warning system was used on Friday , while it was still ra@@ ining in the mobile area .
the River Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both of which are located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers can flood many houses in the suburbs of Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Par@@ ish poses a danger as they only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as over the occurred rivers .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &apos;s border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams still cut people out of flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the Sou@@ thwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed by Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , rose strongly overnight .
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water f@@ lowed and flo@@ cked in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members had all disabilities and he was the only one to swim .
Hans@@ ford said No@@ thel@@ fer saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were housed until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said the floo@@ ding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rapidly spread &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that authorities take into account evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer alert to Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning from 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil was fully absorbed by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ all and street floo@@ ding caused the rescu@@ ing of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , Par@@ ish and lessons in five bor@@ ou@@ ghs .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that an or@@ derly in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated into two churches , which were now both flooded .
the chairman of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities saved 72 people and seven domestic animals r@@ ins@@ ed by the floods .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , there were emergency shel@@ ters to house the evacu@@ ees .
&quot; as soon as the water begins to return , they will return to their homes , &quot; he said .
in the town of Ham@@ mond , the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to floo@@ d@@ water and sand bags were provided for the residents , hoping to keep the water from their homes and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was still ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his statements , a handful of houses on Thursday were reported as floo@@ ding , but no reported on Friday .
Keith Town@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it is still coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; holes perfor@@ ated , &quot; survived sho@@ ot@@ ings in Philadelphia
the police informed that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown was suffering from multiple injuries , including in the end , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was conscious at his transport to hospital .
&quot; he made a lot , his little body was bur@@ sting with bul@@ lets , &quot; his grandmother Del@@ ore Mel@@ zer told the station .
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy told the station that he is expected to recover .
he should have begun the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who finds himself in a critical condition , reported , reports the sender .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police just as@@ cer@@ tained whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ators .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seems to have come to a cross@@ fire between several arch@@ ers .
cartridge pou@@ ches for assault rif@@ les , which were traced back to various assault rif@@ les , s@@ ap@@ ed up the crime scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems that this is clearly a continuing fight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the street , on both sides of the way , there were seals .
in this way , there seems to have given several armed fighters , who were very active , &quot; Police Offic@@ ers Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di assigned the police in Philadelphia to the station .
several houses and vehicles were also taken in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no arrest and the police currently re@@ port@@ edly scrut@@ ini@@ zes the surveillance video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Tuesday another 6 year old girl was hit by a qu@@ ake at her arm when she played in front of her house in the neighborhood of West O@@ ak Lane .
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I propose to myself under the women &apos;s Olympic team in the gymn@@ asti@@ cs hall and that for more than one reason .
first , I &apos;ve been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and second , this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bal@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is Catho@@ lic@@ ine , rounds off , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied black and His@@ panic male presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one female female female is an African @-@ American woman .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion in Simone Bal@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected , but master@@ ly Gy@@ mass routines .
on Thursday Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American , who won gold at an individual majority event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are experiencing the peak of this sport , but we don &apos;t look like gymn@@ astic classes across the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to create it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four gymn@@ asts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that gymn@@ asti@@ cs are an expensive sport and Tur@@ ner is primarily in private sports clubs that are maintained by parents who pay for training , orientation , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for coaches and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of these gymn@@ asti@@ cs are located in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support the business .
in these societies , the Tur@@ ner receive their entire training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bal@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , trained both her athletes since they started gymn@@ asti@@ cs .
we have to inspire the communities au@@ n innumerable , young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easily accessible gymn@@ asti@@ cs training .
I founded my gymn@@ asi@@ um of 20 years .
at my events we have offered free and affordable hub@@ s in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ asti@@ cs who deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ asti@@ cs develop strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team , bringing thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ asti@@ cs and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the Olymp@@ ian team of team and thanks , you motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant doctors want to organise further strikes after having rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes through the adoption of a re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 doctors unanim@@ ously voted against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July Hun@@ t had unveiled plans to introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first assistance physicians are to receive a new contract containing changes to night and weekend dates , in order to improve the care at the earliest times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A committee for assistance physicians , announced last night in a message with : &quot; assistants have still seriously concerns about the proposed treaty , in particular that it addresses the current workforce crisis and it will address all doctors to deal with it . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts by the BM@@ A to resolve disputes through talks clas@@ h@@ ed with the government for reluct@@ ance to participate and sometimes on a de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this happened to a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had just finished last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , lift up the constra@@ int and address the worries of the assistance physicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do so , the assistance doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further training measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in meeting doctors on the strike chain chain .
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes through an acceptance of the re@@ formed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better weekend compensation for the 5@@ 4,000 assistant physicians who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of N@@ HS employees , urged the assistance physicians to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work combat measures do not achieve little , but strain relief teams and service providers and prepare patients , nur@@ ses and their families only worries , ad@@ versity and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last two months we talked to the assistant doctors of the assistance @-@ doctors and responded positively to concerns regarding the guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and the whi@@ stle @-@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics such as des@@ patch , flexibility in training , additional training for those who return from a professional break , training c@@ ough , mutual recognition of the curriculum , continuing education holidays and the Ministry of Health concerning compliance with the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May were a sign of how serious it was employers , Health Education UK and the Ministry of Health .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medicine that can lower the risk of heart attacks
thousands of heart disease patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug , after it was recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ coag@@ ulating medi@@ cam@@ ent T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack .
the N@@ ICE Reg@@ ulations Committee has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ ICE Reg@@ ulations Committee has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the arter@@ ies that form plaque .
when the layer breaks apart , it can cause blood cl@@ ots that c@@ ite blood flow to the heart and thereby cause a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dissolve , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
individuals who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name of Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots impro@@ b@@ able .
the draft of N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE health technology evaluation center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack .
due to a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness lets election fraud in Muslim areas flour@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on dis@@ miss@@ al of a government report for corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread election fraud in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored just like a devastating government report today revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election observers and Rath@@ le@@ aux for ignor@@ ing the evidence of electoral abuse on the basis of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Commun@@ al Government , who is now an anti @-@ corruption rebel , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives was so bad that the police should be allowed to set up barriers outside of voting cabins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should lead a passport to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , a vot@@ er only needs to name his name and address .
the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable inks to a person &apos;s finger if they give up their voting voice in order to prevent someone from choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
he calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions made by non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this not only serves to fight election fraud , but also to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial investment culture associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s election sk@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special court ruled that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be dismissed after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
the Court found that Rah@@ man per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia accus@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the consequence of im@@ itation in which a person chooses as someone else .
Sir Eric declared that there was evidence of fraud across the country .
he expressed particularly al@@ arming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent press election - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations in order to clean the electoral system , including the guiding of evi@@ dences to prove the identity
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his report it says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as proof that pressure has been exer@@ ted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the El@@ ders , especially communities with Pakistan or Banglad@@ es@@ hi backgrounds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... State institutions ignor@@ antly ignored such behaviour as a result of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric declared 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists are working on letter voting documents to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election harvesting &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , considering Ther@@ esa May , also demands tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral list being used for immigration and social security purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable inks on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone choosing twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to make sure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for automatic postal voting .
ban on political activists to process complete let@@ ter@@ ings and envel@@ opes from mail@@ ings .
the police have the authority to set up lock@@ outs around electoral stations .
a change of law , which makes an indictment available for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( Legisl@@ ative Law 1983 ) .
ban on photograph@@ ing in elec@@ tive stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the elec@@ tive stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to make sure employees enforce the rule that voters go alone into the Ele@@ ction Cab@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let case there was no criminal complaint . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Elec@@ toral Court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices un@@ fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons he was ple@@ aded guilty for a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check@@ ups &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the constitu@@ tions of the town halls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court judgement in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country we@@ ars a proud heritage as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of election fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy about Kate &apos;s cycl@@ ist doubles and other famous doubles of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio will be amazed by the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , which has proven to be the impressive double @-@ end predecessor of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ oni@@ k@@ ine is by far not the only athlete capable of fighting gold , which has its own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if one is allowed to give faith to the social media .
in honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces fli@@ ck@@ ering on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympi@@ ans with more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood
except K@@ ates Doppel@@ gänger on the race track , many people on the internet point out how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the US team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a storm on Twitter after images on which he looks sc@@ ary to the wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I myself don &apos;t see great simil@@ arity , with the exception of facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy told the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good looking guy , so I &apos;m probably doing it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly highlight this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ a with her big , expressive eyes shall be able to pass through to the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one course higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Ac@@ tor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ mut , who has similarly severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal winner Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mov@@ a shows more than just the tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair as the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans to equ@@ alize an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the simil@@ arities as well .
theory in space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually , the U.S. football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ ning Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , broad smile that resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese swimming act@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald &apos;s analysis on the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ han at dr . 4x@@ 200m Fre@@ estyle squ@@ ad@@ rons ou@@ tra@@ ged viewers of the C@@ BC live broadcast of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical Games on Wednesday
the Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of its comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; like depression went off &quot; and during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when at the end of the 4x@@ 200m outdoor pool , he gave his own opinions .
Mac@@ Donald , who was brought on board in the commentary team of the C@@ BS to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be heard : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , went as low as a pig , died like a pig .
thanks for this .
the Chinese swimming act@@ ress Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China .

Emm@@ ett Mac@@ arena twe@@ ete , &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old girl from China &quot; died like a pig &quot; ? ? ? ? ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not en@@ capsul@@ ate that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m outdoor swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron for women : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman has lost the connection , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter came quickly and hard , in which many put it to speech
Twitter users did not return when they heard how in@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and makes us look like ra@@ cists . # disgu@@ sted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; shortly afterwards Scott Russ@@ el ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the C@@ BC broadcast live for the commentary by Mac@@ Donald and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the commentary was broadcast over a swimming performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for 90 times at the end of the people responding to the Noti@@ ce on Twitter
the commentary colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our spectators on show and our folklore in the social media .
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
however , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ olog@@ ised in the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention to face it as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s pool in the C@@ BC Olympics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was referring to the performance of the swimming lady and not to her as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the buyers did not know where to go when a woman with@@ drew her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try out under@@ pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she scrut@@ ini@@ zed how she looked at it , pulled her out and put her back on the shelf .
she continued browsing and chat@@ ted four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried under@@ pants before putting her back on the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; she went back and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , with@@ drew her own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a little dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , nau@@ ghty like Osk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when she with@@ drew the pants that you obviously did not like , as she put her back on the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three further under@@ pants , before she finally decided that she liked nothing , drew back and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to be bo@@ thered by observing anybody - or thinking about the person who under certain circumstances would buy the under@@ pants she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how disgu@@ sting that someone would take home@@ poses home that had another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried to pull the garments out of the sale after she went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new couple of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and she didn &apos;t wash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that happened on Tuesday August 9 at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products coming into question were drawn from the sale .
how to protect oneself against weapon attacks using Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we spoke to Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers near distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to turn your predat@@ or around the sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you approach you from behind , then you should turn around as first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the shot line &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and shoulder before hitting him with your free el@@ bow .
then hit him with the knee in the bar and twist , while the attack@@ er cro@@ ushes out of pain , the weapon out of his hands . hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him .
for attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and twist it so that the attack@@ er cannot shoot .
at the same time , shift weight to the weapon and hit the intru@@ der on the chest , then twist the gun from its grip before moving backwards and pointing the gun to it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it works in Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that a rob@@ ber@@ y is the saf@@ est to transfer your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right sch@@ off his tongue to the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe for a travel guide
a British trav@@ eller sub@@ du@@ ed his immune system and rap@@ pro@@ ch@@ ement of a serious test by le@@ ver@@ aging some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the present@@ er and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k che@@ ered his train on a euro note , a hand@@ rail at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a slip @-@ on toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before blan@@ ching each object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show himself what he will get involved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the experiment that was filmed under the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the thought to lick the push of a pull toilet , which has been used by thousands of others , may be totally re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right talked with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and about his own health .
fortunately nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad taste in his mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resili@@ ence of his bow@@ els by travelling through the world and eating odd and wonderful things .
from public rail@@ ings to railway stations to dish@@ washing pans of toilets , the task has definitely put its immune system under a test
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film he was able to live up to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial scre@@ ed showed a lumin@@ ometer number of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ ometer number of fresh washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick after her lumin@@ ous number was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands were less than 60 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; showing the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes close to the worst thing I &apos;ve sm@@ ashed in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more ridi@@ culous than that !
I &apos;m not going to dock here , because it &apos;s disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products validation .
the company is equi@@ pping Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the support of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at while at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biotics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we conducted w@@ ack@@ y bra@@ in@@ stor@@ ming that ended we said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film , added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me tell you this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had tasted some of the things I had instructed him to lick , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet shown in the movie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to introduce Ian to lick her and others , in which this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associated lac@@ tic acid bacteria , in particular with the well being of the stomach and intest@@ ines , and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family destroyed before del@@ oc@@ ating social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left her social home after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation of £ 50,000 because she terr@@ orized her neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ rash , Corn@@ wall .
when they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irre@@ parable state .
the walls had holes , wood floors were torn up , rub@@ b@@ ish was disper@@ sed on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was pla@@ stered to the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation .
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she fears that the apartment is no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider , as this property is probably considered to be a not so beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted on street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking , and excessive scre@@ aming , stri@@ fe and flight .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an order for anti @-@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , wooden floor@@ boards were torn up
neighbours said they were fighting on the street and had to call the police on a regular basis .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing administered them and their partners by force this week by force , after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their life was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t bother anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years apart from them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we couldn &apos;t sleep this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that !
now that they are finally gone , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have failed to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house to which the police was called at regular intervals , 20 years long
litter and old toys were thrown down on the over@@ grown side of the community house
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family , as del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall housing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be horrible .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have courage@@ ously approached us and have provided us with the information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this development will provide comfort to some neighbours and the message is conveyed that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation on the ground
workers in the house administration will now have to evacu@@ ate garbage mountains that surround the house
in 2014 , the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don was given a fine , after she had found herself guilty of own@@ ing a class B drug in commercial law .
she claimed that the money was for a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in 2013 in a car accident .
after being homeless , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many of the rooms of the house were gra@@ ffiti .
the police says they will del@@ o@@ ge tenants who do not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall said that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can act without repro@@ aches and those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal in panic after an eff@@ lor@@ ent military jet flying over the beach
sun worshi@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of air forces put an incredible crash
the air forces indicated that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that no safety risk was present .
this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after a jet flying over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew near to the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped up when they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines , without first seeing what came to them through the clouds .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in social media , said : &quot; twice really flew very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane dropped down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
the Portuguese air forces announced today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify f@@ isher boats in front of the coast and thus had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them .
the speaker said that the jet was flying a little deeper than usual due to the bad visibility conditions nearby , but the air forces insi@@ sted on safety at no time at all .
area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland during this summer , where four of them died to death on the island of Madeira .
the Portuguese air forces announced today that the pilot had to fly so deeply due to the circumstances - heavy fog and fire smoke - which restric@@ ts his view .
the plane was on a training flight where pilot fishing boats had to identify as part of the exercise .
Super@@ cup : worried about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona fights for the first step in the new soccer season on Sunday .
in du@@ el , the Catal@@ ans compete for the Spanish Super@@ cup outside against FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash climbs three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ film@@ maker has to do without the defeated Cup@@ fin@@ alists and the reign@@ ing Europa League Champion , among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who cont@@ ests the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
also Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter is missing .
the German suffered a bend in the knee in the training , which clari@@ fied the demand for Bar@@ ca at least initially in favour of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen in Barcelona have been competing for the status as number one for two years .
on the other hand , coach Luis En@@ rique made a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but for this reason T@@ er St@@ egen is the champion in most of the other applications .
before the first compulsory game of the new season , there are doubts with the Spanish master about the fitness condition of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
at 3 : 2 in Pro@@ s@@ al@@ opp against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. were not really convinced yet .
Sevilla , again , has the 2 : 3 defeat after pro@@ long@@ ation in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph in the Super@@ cop@@ a de Espa@@ ña .
with so far , Barcelona is the record winner in this competition .
Ma Long in an own league to table tennis @-@ gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old won his comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; title defender &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4.4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .
in this way , the World Cup first won the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and just Olympics .
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ th@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made themselves the title of each other .
it was clear that for the third time a Chinese would clin@@ ch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top of the Olympia @-@ Tre@@ ere was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between sets and time @-@ outs they had no coaches .
they pulled back on the tri@@ b@@ une and left their prot@@ ectors in a fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I played the matches up to here for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the fin@@ als I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang said .
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists were competing with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent , Ma was only really fighting in the first set .
after that he set the tempo to the record and left Z@@ hang with a total of 13 points .
through the superi@@ ority of Ma did not the expected ro@@ using match developed .
however , there were nevertheless sufficient stunning ball changes to be seen .
Mi@@ th@@ ani won the bronze game against the 40 year old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White @-@ Russian had drawn up a Ri@@ p @-@ injury , was then in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to settle with sheet metal .
the Swedish Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) were by the way in a similarly high table tennis old Olympia @-@ Vi@@ erte .
Donald Tru@@ mp evacu@@ ates ″ huge problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in the traditionally conservative federal states to lose its majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp now admitted weaknesses of his election campaign in the former republi@@ can strongh@@ old of U@@ tah .
a rare moment , in which the normally large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confi@@ dently appearing mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire expressed as something as concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported .
having thrown 16 ri@@ vals inside his own Republi@@ can camp from the race , the doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp in front of evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blame is false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his famous media sch@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
republi@@ can strongh@@ olds w@@ ack
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ U.S. dating back to June , Tru@@ mp and his rival were of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutes see Tru@@ mp in the front , but not by the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
in an interview with the CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp answers the question as to how he wants to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and whether afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does nothing other than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling the truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it could not be enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , Tru@@ mp continued .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party Tru@@ mp is said to have threatened to raise funds to support its election campaign , it should not be able to present better survey values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans wanted to get stronger under the arms for Congress . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Olympics : three @-@ est dec@@ eption in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C aims to set up a disciplinary committee .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games .
after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a trainer home .
the International Olympic Committee decided to immediately set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan officials told us that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , delivered a urine test in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Red .
this was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by dop@@ ing controllers .
the World Association IA@@ AF has requested IO@@ C for information on the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations , an IA@@ AF speaker distributed .
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures taken by the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; said the IA@@ AF .
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and presented himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Red , the sample delivered and signed , &quot; said K@@ eni@@ as Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete , who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i had become World Cup fourth in Beijing in 2015 more than 800 meters .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan athlete , Michael Rot@@ i , was withdrawn from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed about pending dop@@ ing tests against money payments from his country .
according to media reports , he was reported to have been arrested at his return to Nairobi airport .
Kenya is already under special observation at the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing trials .
during the announcement of the IO@@ C launched more than 2000 dop@@ ing targets in front of the Rio Games , it was un@@ usually pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
the World Anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exercised a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics beginning .
as a result , WA@@ DA has taken Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is conform to the rules of the WA@@ DA .
Kenya is regarded as a great runner nation .
the athletes of the country won the most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of television reports on the ARD , repro@@ aches have repeatedly been raised that in Kenya dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible and there should be a considerable mentality of sports fraud .
member of the IO@@ C , Richard Po@@ und , recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had employed in the Russian athle@@ tics industry .
it has been demonstrated that in this sport , it became widespread and systematically cur@@ bed .
Russia &apos;s athletes were subsequently expelled from the summer games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Salzburg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ year the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic lovers of love , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Mary .
in the orchestra , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Symphony Orchestra under the leadership of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that it is very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli is playing an older Maria .
she reminds us of her love with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
first because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
it is therefore smart , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it resembles me very much , my Italian character that I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an enormous generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his glan@@ ces , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a happy approach to life , which is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , at that time the offer@@ cans returned to New York , and the New York population did not want them .
they are the same topics , and they are as convincing today as at the time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
according to reports , Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school girls left London last year to join the IS , died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago her family learned about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , I@@ TV news reported on Thursday .
Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had prepared to leave the war @-@ torn country and to return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is - as warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - keeping people from ever making this decision , &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e .
in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other girls from the East of London got into a plane in the direction of Turkey and then sent a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family has been informed that she has married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says Clinton would stay as a candidate for the Supreme Court in the case of a winner at Gar@@ land
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the Demo@@ crat candidate , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate Ju@@ dge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
Republi@@ can in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ nell is of the opinion that the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased judge of the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday Rei@@ d said during a telephone conference that he was expecting from Clinton to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not yet spoken to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulate .
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court of the U.S. Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , be mini@@ ons and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp .
he also stated that Donald Tru@@ mp is un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ats wants to make nu@@ d calendar for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women and for men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazine co@@ operates with photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to present a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked human beings , they would like to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses calendar for 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nu@@ g@@ magazin of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys differ since &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he is the view that it does the calendar too .
&quot; we need to return to the representation of timeless and classical n@@ ak@@ edness , where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the publication of the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or in person with an open Cast@@ ing call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community expects mass flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not fit and praise Erdo@@ gan , sit on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; D vice @-@ president of the Gü@@ len @-@ Stiftung Di@@ alogue and Welt , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in short , the Kurdish municipality of Germany is expecting tens of thousands of prot@@ ectors fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the president of the association , Ali Top@@ ra@@ k , believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the harsh criticism of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundred thousand guar@@ dians from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; says the president of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday .
because the government had already covered Kurdish strongh@@ olds with criminal sanctions several months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey are fle@@ eing .
after the en@@ chanted put@@ sch there are still secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that takes up refugees even in its own country produces refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief of the group compla@@ ined about the deliber@@ ate settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
with this , Erdo@@ gan wants to raise the exit pressure to the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradic@@ ated or displaced in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government called for the federal government to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his supporters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in Germany a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is taking place against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the past few months .
the German branch of Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the Brand@@ ing as Gü@@ len @-@ trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; he who does not fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , inci@@ dentally also the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chair of the Gü@@ len @-@ nah@@ Stiftung Dialog and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reports on figures from the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks have already set up the largest group of asylum seekers in Germany because of political persecution .
as of June 30 , this would have been 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus nearly 29 percent of all recognised as asylum @-@ holders ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , there are no wages before war , poverty or lack of prospects .
asylum Rights in accordance with the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. by the state side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals do not get anything from the summer campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia should not choose the Land@@ tag .
they understood in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2021 will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament voted already at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more stupid than to date it is not possible : summer holidays , heat and land elections - this is bit@@ ing .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the electoral champi@@ ons , are on vacation .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not natives , so don &apos;t be allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
there are practical problems : during the holidays , hel@@ pers , the posters hanging up , infl@@ ating ballo@@ ons , distributing fl@@ yers and counting on the end are just lab@@ orious .
until September 4 , 2016 , the electoral and final day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign almost to the people .
the hot phase , if one can say it at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in p@@ olls .
exciting is how badly new@@ bie af@@ e cuts and what remains at the end of the coalition agreement .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign , one can see from his large posters .
he travels through the country , distri@@ butes roses and chat@@ ting a bit with the people , just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also did .
otherwise , counsel@@ ing has got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel sets the blame on the blo@@ om of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has spe@@ eded up the rise of right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its chief candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is , if at the wrong time , at the right place , election campaign .
she has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major talks ; Merkel federal election district lies in the north @-@ east .
but the target group didn &apos;t agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compla@@ ined Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad not to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
apart from that , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U ren@@ oun@@ ces the usual campaign conditions at market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with paras@@ ols and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this , like coconut , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minor role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Union also noted that in the country you have to ro@@ b the base that it must be very strict to find a link to the people again .
you are dealing with the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : barely present in the vast@@ ness of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the advice of the CD@@ U election fighter Kok@@ ert to his comrades is also self @-@ deb@@ ating : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where the people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD into a particularly committed campaign .
in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats were last 22 per cent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the 2011 election , the SPD won a clear victory at 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the surveys , should make the leap into the parliament .
they make a modern virtue out of vacation @-@ need and largely transfer their campaign to the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is called the national president Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise green campaig@@ ners engage in search for local ch@@ ords among the vac@@ ation@@ ers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ ates just with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg Lake L@@ akes and also finds it beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electoral holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants suffer from block@@ age
there is nothing to complain about on the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
for those responsible for the construction works , which start at 5.@@ 30@@ am in the morning and end only at about 8@@ pm , there are everywhere praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they made everything quite cr@@ un@@ chy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no delay either .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south scheduled for half @-@ time at the beginning of the week , everything should be ready by the end of October .
the same applies to those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to the establishment of expe@@ dients .
since the construction site was mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and the closure of Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fan@@ dingen has been lifted and thus also the connection to Rot@@ tenburg gives rise , the traffic situation within the town has eased .
the citizens can now move from O@@ fan@@ dingen to the B 27 on both sides .
the transit through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some significant complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the deputy head manager Florian King , responsible for the transport management of the refurb@@ ishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ gasse road , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many routes were looking for and more familiar to their navigation than the sign@@ age .
what led to the fact that some trucks end up in residential areas .
as the speed limits were not observed , the municipality demanded to ampli@@ fy the measuring vehicle made of M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were significant transgres@@ sions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who excell@@ ed himself on the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have already been scored .
the quick@@ est was on the way with 77 hour kilometres in the Tempo @-@ 30 @-@ Zone .
since the construction site has moved on , however , it has become cal@@ mer .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg , the road is open again .
business@@ men don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has led to revenue short@@ falls in them leaves anyone you ask .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus produced for other companies , for whom the rehabilitation has little consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most slight drop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the deal@@ ership Ma@@ ier , but also ad@@ mits that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mil@@ eage is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the local spots along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the inn@@ s have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
we need to be happy about every euro sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the revenue shr@@ ank to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the street renovation has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrown back its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of his employees have to be dismissed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dent Jörg Schmidt responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner whether there could be a financial compensation , with the hint that the restaurant would benefit from the advantages of the location at the B 27 .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows about other rural districts where such gener@@ osity has been handled .
in all cases , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history .
that other regular guests now look less frequently due to the complicated traffic guidance , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t drive , it is also somewhere else nice .
however , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts that his pedi@@ gree bill comes back to the end of the renovation work .
despite the crisis of BSE and avi@@ an flu , G@@ öh@@ ner keeps the effects of the B 27 construction work on its customers for the biggest crisis , which has experienced its restaurant in its long @-@ term history .
six months of construction work is already brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the name of the fight against terrorism , the law is constantly being ro@@ uted to laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
following the recent proposals , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick security package .
but what has a tolerance status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all of this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the vers@@ mi@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they do not ask anybody .
other , more advanced points would be discussed at first within the parties .
I also take part in this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , as the Minister of the Interior , he was in favour of results and in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had a little time to pass before he presented his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some things are already known , announced , announced , that a new security authority should take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also not the fact that Germany must implement several EU rules on passenger data and weapons legislation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second attempt for proposals that have not been made with the SPD so far : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with double citizenship the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CD@@ U @-@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he nevertheless holds this for reasonable and also demands nothing whatsoever with the coalition partner any chances anyway .
a few new ideas also present de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
some of them have it in themselves : he is planning quick procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for the incar@@ cer@@ ation of people before deportation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees who are targeted in the country should check their smartphones in advance and disclose social media accounts for a security check . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of Dul@@ ce for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than to date , such as those who commit crimes or intentionally throw away their papers in order to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of them are political and legal .
some also still seem in@@ ex@@ hor@@ ted and leaves questions un@@ answered .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient ones for example - the question arises : what does this have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
in addition , in view of the high number of refugees , many people worried about security .
and things that were pro@@ found@@ ly employed by men could not be cl@@ inging up even in election times .
the inner safety has moved enormously .
only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the topic of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few days , it has been high between the two parties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a gar@@ chy argument about the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior Minister , in which the resort chiefs also demand a Bur@@ ka prohibition and a departure from the dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also lab@@ ors here with conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
he kept nothing from a departure from the double pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have satisfied the discussion in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
making them new is not sensible .
and in the case of a bur@@ q@@ a ban , he has constitutional concerns .
whether its own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is indeed &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , must first show itself .
there is a lot of things in it , which could cause hass@@ le .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but even the SPD is currently trying to improve on the subject of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel , carefully sign@@ al@@ ises talks and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Originaltitel : desperate Hou@@ se@@ wives ( TV )
in spite of diesel @-@ sc@@ andal the distribution numbers are increasing worldwide .
but it does not run smoothly in all markets .
in the recall action , there is a vor@@ tex around a term .
Volkswagen starts deliveries in the second half of the year .
although Europe &apos;s biggest car manufacturer continues to show a plus throughout the course of the year , despite the diesel offering , thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July , the core brand VW was weak@@ ening notably in Western Europe and again bur@@ dened the total sales as the company listed in the D@@ ax .
worldwide , the VW brand in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars sold 1.8 percent fewer cars than in the previous year &apos;s month .
in Western Europe alone , China is the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
in the home market Germany the deliveries declined by almost a sixth .
brand sales manager Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July most notably to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there has been a buying back in some core markets by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the situation around the attempted coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on the exit from the EU also bur@@ dened , explained a spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the USA , where the exhaust f@@ umes first escal@@ ated , a minus is also added .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the primarily affected domestic brand of Nieder@@ sachsen is likely to be off lightly due to the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an extra@@ dition reduction of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
from January to July , group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler was able to show a further sale .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated a software exhaust system .
in Germany alone VW calls around 2.5 million vehicles for retro@@ fitting into the workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting , VW rein@@ forces that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the conversion , the car manufacturer points out a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as stated on Friday in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is legal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen is now granting its German customers a guarantee for fully equipped diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have been confirmed by VW representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
the Ministry of Transport confirms that this meeting was held .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my Inqu@@ iry Commission and the KBA Complete &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; deviations from this will not be accepted , &quot; stated Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry .
VW has assumed the guarantee that no deterior@@ ations occur in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after retro@@ fitting and all type approval relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen himself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was called in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the wide term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example half a year after the conversion , customers can come to a workshop with a motor damage - and this can lead back to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interests of the customer , too , it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage that has nothing to do with the trigger sc@@ andal , it comes to uncertainty about possible warranty regulations as it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore VW is not using the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund at Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands pen@@ al interest from wealthy depos@@ itors in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight or day accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German B@@ anks speaks of an individual case and sees in it no signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers need &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not fear to pay for their austerity measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks are storing money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay their 0.4 percent pen@@ alties .
in September of September , the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund will charge for deposits of over 100,000 euros for deposits or day @-@ to @-@ day accounts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100.000 Euro are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 costs will cost 400 euros per year in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he kept 40 million Euros for some time , which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and generate 0.4 percent of costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every million Euro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs are now passed on according to the poll@@ uter pays principle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; leaving the cash in the aults of the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t want even the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bank Chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers would have understanding and changed to other investment forms .
few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association Bayern declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy stance causes considerable costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to carry them alone , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically not possible permanently &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thurin@@ gian folk and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines in 2014 with penalty interest for deposits of three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide allowance for deposits , the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , which is a bit more opul@@ ent of wealth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is free of charge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are currently no further banks known to calculate a substitute for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokesperson Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banks und Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold to go to the negative for private customers is very , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to the competition .
the customers in Germany will not be able to please that in the width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lonely middle @-@ aged men love plates .
before comm@@ itting to the commentary box , to over@@ see it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym not all@@ ele &apos;s middle @-@ aged with harsh insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much discussed resur@@ gence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that would like to welcome the news of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
it is also no hor@@ des by hob@@ b@@ ys@@ amm@@ ers - it has an emotional meaning : older fle@@ ets retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but tune the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit before I stop standing , hold my hands and say something about it like : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there still remains a handful of fantastic record specialist shops .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to several men in such shops and try to assess their age and mood by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I follow from Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three middle aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight middle @-@ aged men , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I already like , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records .
these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , rev@@ ise the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records that he could not afford than they appeared and again buy items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably was a bit too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much .
this is my truck .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets on the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pub , people who heard about the com@@ eback and decided to buy back their old records .
from the conversations that I have conducted , people tend to get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of the record label of a particular age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of records ?
it only takes a few seconds in a store like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z some of the older customers contacted the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar disc covers , from objects that call for happy rejo@@ icing memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of empt@@ iness or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think that it is so many people .
it is a simple way to mentally concern yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee flo@@ ated from a stack of records . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record don &apos;t have record players .
at this point in the news report , I would probably look very worried as I plan@@ ks through a pile of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Series of Directors : three middle @-@ aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival .
&quot; someone came here just recently and said : &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead Sound Pl@@ ate so that I can put it on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less musi@@ c@@ wise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have record players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones who are only slowly getting in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mo@@ p , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records , has a b@@ lower audience when I go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age and middle @-@ aged women .
even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ - and sex@@ be@@ hol@@ ter Pop instead of experimental jazz gro@@ ans from the loud@@ speakers - is it good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but na@@ ï@@ ve psychological trauma is hard to det@@ ectable when standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates for sale .
it tends to be stro@@ lling rather than buying a big shopping bag .
it doesn &apos;t earn much , therefore collecting plates is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she drives away with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I appear to bol@@ ster the jeans hot pants , I observe a group of young teen girls who are looking for a moment to group Pol@@ aro@@ id Cam@@ eras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a cros@@ ley record player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of panels of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody sees them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate art &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is also the one that is the most for luxury items such as plates .
even though my research suggests that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they are not considered , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record lovers existing in reality , record shops and online forums .
these people are working hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security not having stro@@ lling through the record shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets through records , while they steer clear of the star@@ ving glance of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false present@@ er who raises nothing of middle @-@ aged men over the shoulders .

French Court re@@ jects deal on demo@@ lition of stores in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional stores and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 provisional stores where people inside the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to end drinks , sell hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be demol@@ ished because they would constitute a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which contain a fire and mobility risk .
humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also led to the fact that the temporary establishments and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals to people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of those who operate the 72 provisional businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; absolutely comprehensible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ju@@ dge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feeding people living &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places threatened by the decline was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is commonly used and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0.000 people signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants on Friday estimated that the number of people living in the jungle camp has risen to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in newcom@@ ers during the summer .
despite Olympia @-@ disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant

&quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , remain confident and cont@@ end , &quot; the 31 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro in Facebook .
he has no explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place at the sugar lo@@ af .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything that we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

group increases with start @-@ up for live video games
watching other people watching video games is a tri@@ ck@@ ling - this will also benefit Microsoft .
the technology group bu@@ ys the start @-@ up Be@@ am , which specializes in this hobby .
Microsoft announced on Thursday how much money flows for the take @-@ over .
Be@@ am went to the start with his offer in January and already has more than 100,000 users .
you can watch others while playing but also intervene .
for example , they can give up players missions and oppose enemies as well as provide equipment .
the Game eri@@ ese Activ@@ ision Bli@@ zz@@ ard will launch a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of E @-@ Sports .
on the way to the global media event , Facebook is meant to help .
the advertising industry is already listening .
the start @-@ ups , which is headquartered in Seattle in Washington , USA , moved to Microsoft &apos;s Red@@ mond headquarters in California , as Be@@ am co @-@ founder and chef Matt Sal@@ sam@@ end@@ i shared .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
Be@@ am is integrated into the video games department around the X@@ box console , according to Microsoft .
the live streaming market of video games is growing rapidly .
known platforms are T@@ witch and YouTube Gaming .
witch was bought from the online retailer Amazon in 2014 - for nearly a billion dollars .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation speed sensor : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash@@ es are being tested , which should effectively transfer the tem@@ pos .
the futur@@ istically working En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler from the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at the areas of accident , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , at highway construction sites or to refurb@@ ishing bridges with temporary speed police , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary speed limit for observ@@ ance of the speed limit .
however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be detected over several tracks at the same time .
variable speed limits as well as access restrictions after time , lane and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the advanced state you can move the trailer according to manufacturer with each car with trailer hit@@ ch .
in order that it is not simply cl@@ apped , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels disappear in the arm@@ oured and by the way also a fire@@ proof outer shell .
furthermore , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic &apos;s specifications in various federal states and is now also used .
also foreign authorities are flash@@ ing with the new technology : recently France has ordered 100 units , after an order of 150 copies last year .
UK picks up silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ j@@ án Master@@ class Gold picks up
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ 7 Ru@@ g@@ by ended on Thursday evening to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were hit by a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the de@@ odor@@ o Stadium in Rio .
Fiji distributed a master class in handling , Side @-@ Step@@ ping , back @-@ up , line run and ru@@ her strength to win Gold - her first Olympic Games of any color .
the defeat was sweet@@ ened by the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back to them in the final .
but regardless of it , a 15 @-@ man team would have beaten Fiji in this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for UK - but it will probably not - that at least one Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Chief trainer Ben R@@ yan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago , R@@ yan lost every game with the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they just lost one .
this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fiji started wondering and let off the attacks G@@ Bs from fun .
it felt for captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. as if they were running in buses . the World Series winners went to the top 5 @-@ 0 , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au be@@ headed in the corner .
with four more minutes playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ v@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a ra@@ ging T@@ ackle from Mit@@ ch@@ ell hal@@ ted the mount of man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but Fiji had only stopped .
in the seventh minute , Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a played a touch@@ down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new member since the re @-@ whi@@ stle and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pressed through further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and ran up to the line to make a goal .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is as if Fiji had been born to play the 7 , while GB is still un@@ learned .
this is how it is .
GB led fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the ratios of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova was running after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fiji .
Dan Nor@@ ton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left @-@ hand corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was long in favor of the South Sea sul@@ phi@@ ans , whose fans sang , wa@@ ving flags and danced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds .
the fi@@ bri@@ ff sounded , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged themselves and GB ki@@ cked out cr@@ ush@@ ingly in the grass .
earlier on the day Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a tight half final match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a goal among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ eric gold than with these games and that will mean what is called .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 hard p@@ ieve that go into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though it was only the che@@ ers who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all@@ present when they rowed for the second Olympic old in the two without a tax conc@@ ub@@ ine , the first women in the history of British Sports who used such a scale .
her domin@@ ance was absolute , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ beaten work , which is also exemplary .
what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ ins , who gli@@ de across the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the kind of triumph .
behind every gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make the difference and it was none other than the coach who didn &apos;t know 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that &apos;s what they did .
if you do not do this , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky to start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum if that is the right word at all .
I needed money , so I had to get better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient .
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is a challenge , but that makes it even bigger .
in the immedi@@ acy of the victory their first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve wre@@ cking morning doing something more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning who was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . it may be a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I and hel@@ en and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have asked for a better person for exercising or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning didn &apos;t have a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to catch up , p@@ anning and glo@@ ver had much in reserve .
we were very caught at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t prepared to make something great .
we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she simply wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic Champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the current Chairman , Breit@@ brunn &apos;s Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed water@@ wart in 1985 and has been appointed managing director of the ken@@ nel association in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they stretched from water management and maintenance work on office and organisational skills , budget planning , fees and contributions to emergency interventions on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
she called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the renovation of the high tank ( 1999 ) , the acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the re@@ building of water pipes .
there has been no stand@@ still and one has always added new innovations because water means life and drinking water is the most important food .
in her speech , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers tru@@ sty , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has used a lot of blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has lived the water @-@ purpose association correctly as if it were his own company .
just a few weeks ago , as a true practitioner , he was able to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group to reduce nit@@ rate in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , for his part , praised Aqu@@ arian Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he was the best water atten@@ dant and he was a faithful boy@@ friend .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
from his point of view he described the well @-@ being and the restructuring of the ken@@ nel association .
but the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the rup@@ ture at the elevated tank near Kirch@@ lou@@ der on January 3 .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
once again the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained , because you filled the reservoir of P@@ ett@@ neu with hoses .
the management of the drinking water management association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer , from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko openly deals with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other interested parents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must have the courage to talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a .
when the disease was detected with her son , she believed that she must die .
however , the eight @-@ year old Ti@@ ago has come up well and now learn privately in New York , where there are the best therapists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him something , which dates back to two years when I sang at La Scala in Milan , he recalls nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is the happ@@ i@@ est person on earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ reb@@ ko &apos;s connection with the bass bar@@ it@@ one Er@@ win Sch@@ rott .
she is now married to the tenor Y@@ usi@@ f Ey@@ v@@ az@@ ov .
relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shoots on partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ m@@ n ) on Friday at 10 : 45 in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ m@@ n ) and wounded her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called himself with us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the off@@ ender was on the run , and after him I was publicly prosec@@ uted .
meanwhile , since Sven S. could be travelling by car .
the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ baked and has a bald .
meanwhile , the police published a photo of him .
it is however a couple of years old .
meanwhile the man is wearing a lat@@ ex .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police .
who sees Sven S. , shall call 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship of relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 .
the competent police in Lü@@ beck wanted first of all to make no information about the Ta@@ ther@@ gang or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims ; however , it confirmed that a human being had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a crime off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses a Special Operations Command was ( SE@@ K ) at the crime scene .
steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ packed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of millions .
financial burdens that threatened the industry from green energy promotion are from the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it remains in the liberation from the renewable energy conversion in the existing plants for so @-@ called self @-@ current production in the German steel industry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach this after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers to use gas from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened with additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel plants , an EEG conversion is 20 percent .
but even these are not le@@ vi@@ ed in the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on self @-@ regulation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way the status quo of the present scheme is largely as@@ cer@@ tained .
Gabriel is of particular importance to the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel is future &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of the emissions right trade , climate and employment targets are to be weighed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe has suffered over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation further ag@@ grav@@ ated when the world &apos;s largest producer of producer China threw masses of steel on the world market in light of the ailing domestic demand .
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel companies price dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring the situation has become somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , the import duties imposed on imports show effect , on the other hand the economic prospects in China have bri@@ gh@@ tened .
it is unclear how sustain@@ ably the price collection is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
last but not least Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp did not want to exclude closing of individual works .
around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , despite rising prices and increasing orders , the German steel producers remain cau@@ tious .
at 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Division announced on Friday .
after a short up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the produced quantity went back to the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with a rising output .
community , spirit , health : singing does sen@@ iors good
the singing accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp all her life : as a young girl she was in school choir , in Leh@@ ra@@ mt he took the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in an sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more alive , she says .
by the way , she does something good with her health and mind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler of the German Senior league . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
thanks to regular meeting sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and cultivate social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for the elderly train a deep and controlled respir@@ ation .
those who regularly request their lungs will not be able to get out of the powder as quickly as they are in everyday life .
even if it comes to keeping the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an ideal hobby .
on older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Working Group of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens .
in the older generations the common singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people w@@ akes up many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through lyrics and especially melodies , even dementia @-@ like people are un@@ aware of long @-@ lying events .
when singing , the head is also required to perform a special achievement , L@@ enz explains .
to concentrate on one &apos;s own voice and to a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially older people who live alone are doing so not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem increases with the singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I do something for a long time , I become better and more alert about myself - this experience strengthens .
there are good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
if you want to try a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who hears there when a sound goes wrong ?
if you are looking for a suitable offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior level , one can simply join .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can directly contact the church or the church leader .
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors for help with the internet search .
those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
sing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for all ages .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than han@@ go@@ vers on scre@@ aming of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover which effect the calls of cat babies have on adult animals .
to her surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust also did not leave the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved equal in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the patho@@ gen level of cat babies at the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
they respond faster by ten percent faster to k@@ itt@@ ens , who are in great need , as scientists have found out from the Veter@@ inary Academy and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
males also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and heavily reg@@ ressed k@@ itt@@ ens for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said Bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of MH@@ H .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is the author of the study published this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team had already discovered that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cries out with the ur@@ gency of their depen@@ dency .
a total of nine adult males and eight que@@ ens from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H were observed .
they were played for a rep@@ ut@@ ations of babies who were taken from the throwing box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with cries of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were additionally raised .
the researchers maintain their results in spite of the low sample for meaningful results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females , even those who have not had their own offspring , re@@ acted to the cries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to the loudspeaker , when this calls of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens played off .
this ability may be inn@@ ate or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly examined the reactions of women and men to baby sounds repeatedly in humans .
some studies showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to babies , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann also reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski reaches Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala . &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued in Turkey against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match will take place in Turkey .
before the Du@@ el of the Arch@@ du@@ als between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual . &quot;
even with the suspension of the exceptional state after the attempted coup attempt in July , the government , the everyday life of normal citizens , was not to be affected .
this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt .
this is also not the case before football .
against the former strong i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r , the public prosec@@ utor issued an arrest warrant .
according to this , the South Coast who now lives in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ me@@ r shall be the supporters of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency persi@@ sts for 90 days still until October , the fact that most Turks do not have any impact on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan to be finished on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like all the country - split into supporters and enemies of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
but what the Turks den@@ ies in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans even agree - no matter if their hearts beat for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at cup winner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a special finish to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as top scor@@ er of his association .
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and his team secured the cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the pre @-@ qualifying K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; Li@@ ons &quot; will also depart early in the Europa League .
in the South Li@@ g it was enough to rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win anything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;ve done this and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the year was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who presented the basis for the 14th title with 26 season ap@@ points as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ cher@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig .
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 year old .
in the case of the Treaty of Florence , the Gom@@ ez , which was under contract under contract and announced on Bes@@ ik@@ tas , did not return after the coup attempt , not to return to the country &apos;s political situation after his European vacation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just needs to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club Director Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the stri@@ ker would have to be ready to ren@@ ounce about a third of his annual salary of 7.5 million Euros , or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have med@@ als opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Justi@@ n Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova may not start in Rio .
others over@@ run athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh at it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing still determines the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ yo@@ va , who had compla@@ ined about her start right after a dop@@ ing @-@ ban shortly before the games , was pi@@ ped out mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 m breast ) mer@@ cil@@ essly .
it was a qu@@ ir@@ ky scenario : with a super@@ charged smile she was still in the hall and had prov@@ oked her appearance .
when he saw that she didn &apos;t get gold , the audience went out into a j@@ ub@@ el@@ rush .
but there are still many more athletes who are going to start the Olympic Games in Rio despite D@@ oping past .
here is an overview :
Justi@@ n Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was locked twice for dop@@ ing twice ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , it is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest challen@@ ger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jamaica ) : the second time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit in 2010 after taking the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation , she had strong tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympic champion of 2012 , World Championship in 2013 and European Championship was tested positively on the banned stimul@@ ant drug meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic denied the sent@@ in@@ ance and was closed for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est throws this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics Champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , had been positive in 2010 and locked for 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement was responsible , bet@@ tered Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world for more than 200 and 400 m .
Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : hardly any athlete had been recognized as many med@@ als afterwards .
thus Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to hand off Olympics silver 2004 for ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the Euro @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone mis@@ use .
he also received the bronze medal at the 2008 Olympic Games due to a judgment of the International Sports Tribunal CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m , he ranks second in the World Ranking List .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world champion and gold fav@@ ori@@ tin was only tested in May , but may still start in Rio .
in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , indications of taking a banned food supplement have been found , the lock of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency WA@@ DA was mil@@ der and was already running on July 13th .
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she had suffered from cuts and had been treated at the hospital but had already left it .
she planned her return journey for the beginning of September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon , also Austrian citizens are still unclear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , such as Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
the Hu@@ a H@@ in , located around 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , were initially explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a quarter of two bombs .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two explo@@ sives once again went up , while another person was killed by the authorities .
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured during det@@ on@@ ation near the seaside resort Pat@@ ong .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed a city cler@@ k .
according to the authorities in a flower bed , the explosive device had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the prec@@ inct of the coast police .
finally , there were several wounded in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south @-@ eastern coast .
one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called .
&quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings carry the same signature , &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express itself to possible motives - but probably it is a matter of the deeds of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the terrorist attacks of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist revolt movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Bangkok spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is rather assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid .
in recent days , the authorities have kept secret indications of upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they have not been informed of the exact time and places .
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
the police have instructed their officials throughout the country to reinforce the security of important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment areas .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they are mostly not against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used for years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the bom@@ b@@ astic bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to follow the instructions of the Thai safety authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ ts@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its surroundings .
after confron@@ tations between the security forces and the Muslim populations , there will be no unnecessary journeys in these provinces .
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution elabor@@ ated by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military a great influence over the coming years .
Jun@@ ta Chef and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to create may@@ hem while the country is heading towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism .
the military jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest , will now benefit itself to restore the kingdom to stability and order .
however , the military has not succeeded in getting a grip on the rebel@@ li@@ ous rebellion of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
just a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t plot of the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is targeted by the Federal Office for constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several national defe@@ ats , the conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the Bund defended the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; we see evidence of aspir@@ ations for the free @-@ democratic basic order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said constitutional chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ eder of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , migrants from the Islamic faith or from the Middle East are being de@@ fam@@ ed in an extrem@@ ist manner .
that is why we observe the movement now .
the &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has also been active in Germany since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multi@@ cul@@ tur@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - are already observing the &quot; Identi@@ ties . &quot;
Ma@@ ate said that his authority was closely aligned with the regional offices when deciding .
&quot; groups such as the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; attempt to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; said the constitutional chief .
generally , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a fair advertisement for your own thing .
the propaganda is meant to address people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; la@@ stly , there were reports on contacts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ yo said , he didn &apos;t have any findings .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this type are only relevant at a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , will change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor here is whether such persons can influence the party .
this is not apparent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking at the marked increase of legal crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we have seen in recent years that there can be judicial structures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
it may well be that further legal @-@ terrorism groups or small groups are planning to plan the attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee homes or attacks from other extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a Germany @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide controller of right @-@ wing terrorism cannot be discern@@ ed .
the previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
worried about the fact that many attacks went to the account of people who had not appeared in the right scene before .
this is wor@@ rying .
many of the crimes suspect in attacks on asylum lod@@ gings have previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or followers of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed criminal off@@ ences , who previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who might have been politically in@@ different , or , for example , elected CD@@ U , SPD or left , who , however , have ra@@ dic@@ alized by far right wing @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te Bec@@ omes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always do the Olympic Games or the World Records decide the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous show of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly obes@@ e swi@@ mmer made up of Ethiopia so slowly that at times it was no longer visible in the TV images .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was chosen .
in social networks , Hab@@ te became the viral inter@@ ne@@ tite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his conc@@ entri@@ c run of 48 seconds and occupied the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not exactly sporting figure , which attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
the Ethi@@ op@@ ian received a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more famous .
since most sports@@ men are running in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something different .
preparation is everything : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media called him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ bel of W@@ hale &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; referring to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English bou@@ levard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun of him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 @-@ metre fre@@ estyle , played no role .
compar@@ isons with Eric the E@@ el were also drawn .
at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i provided media attention .
the appearance of the bu@@ oy@@ ancy chamber of Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea was unforgettable , when he had to face alone in a pre @-@ run over 100 metres of fre@@ estyle .
at that time M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim just eight months before the Olympics and had never taken such a long distance before the competition .

Tru@@ mp sees the im@@ pending election defeat not so tight
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp talks to a campaign event in Florida .
should there be nothing with the election of the US president , Donald Tru@@ mp is already an alternative video .
he will then go on holiday .
if Donald Tru@@ mp is losing the US presidential election in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter : &quot; ultimately it will either fold , or I have a very nice , long vacation , &quot; the candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said in a telephone interview with the US TV broad@@ caster CN@@ BC .
if it could not be enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , Tru@@ mp said .
thus he called the US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) .
in his party more and more resistance formed .
post increases in trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great .
the post is planning to sell their electric vehicle stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter .
the Group intends to start trading with the transpor@@ ter shortly .
the post office plans to offer its electric transpor@@ ters on the free car market as of next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter into the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for months , the company has been examining whether they want to sell their self @-@ developed stre@@ et@@ sco@@ ot@@ ers , with which letters and pack@@ ets are delivered , also to sell to other companies .
post office Ju@@ er@@ gen Ger@@ dis had said there are always questioning , for example by craftsmen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bonn Group will shortly enter into mass production of vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift in the post @-@ production plant .
Ger@@ des announced that the Group wants to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and make a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we change the complete fleet .
the stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter is active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ RP leadership starts after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K ex@@ poses his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the tail@@ backs suddenly came - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K sen@@ sed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann will be even more uncertain , the longer the successes promised by him will remain .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg Market Research Company Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the resignation of the company leadership , the global number five in the industry is facing a personnel new beginning .
GF@@ RP executives want to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert already reti@@ res from the Supervisory Board with effect from September 12 .
the management of the Executive Board already took over the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger on September 1 , the company informed the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shall officially take over the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spokesperson &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann is found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the long @-@ term business policy orientation as a reason for the tail@@ backs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to name a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
anyone who is going to lead the market research company in the future is still unclear at this time .
in investor @-@ circles it was said on Friday , in the shareholders , the disappointment about the continuing success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago was big .
Euro@@ monitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the fruits of restructuring are not to be seen even after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , every shareholder would eventually become rest@@ less .
&quot; if that was the case with BMW , that would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; it said .
after set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company did not have the ability to stop loss of losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
at EUR 36@@ 1.2 million , revenue was 6.1 percent lower than the previous year &apos;s comparative figure .
in the first half of the year , sales shr@@ ank by 3.4 percent with 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros .
earnings in the second quarter primarily imp@@ acted the company &apos;s s@@ unken value in the face of its difficult economic situation .
the Company &apos;s value impair@@ ment of 139 million euros , which had become necessary in the Consumer Experience business area , had a loss of 14@@ 8.2 million euros on the Group .
in the second quarter of 2015 , Gf@@ K generated a net income of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - bus sli@@ ps into Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n in Gra@@ ben : eight injured
in an accident of a coach with 43 sen@@ iors , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the in@@ mates suffered serious injuries , informed the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her data , had to devi@@ ate from an opposite truck , which was driving partly on the counter @-@ road .
the bus arrived right from the street and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , like a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus on their own , &quot; she said .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and an emergency ambul@@ ance came to the accident site on the state road 2 .
the last travellers were brought back from a regular bus to the Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators called on the bear@@ ers and potential witnesses to report to the police .
starting October 1 , 2016 , the charges per cubic meter of waste water amount to 2.@@ 10 euros for the sewage system Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , 3.@@ 36 Euro ( until now 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf € 3.@@ 64 ( until now 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a rough calculation , the wastewater price in Az@@ endorf will be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , when appro@@ ving the budget by the Land@@ rats@@ amt &quot; Kul@@ mb@@ ach &quot; ( Land@@ rats@@ amt ) Kul@@ mb@@ ach was established , under@@ cover for these sewage systems .
due to legal foundations , the market in Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the facilities at a cost @-@ effective manner .
from October 1 , 2016 , the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the wal@@ let .
the increase in fees is between 48 and 67 percent .
as Board Manager Herbert Schmidt displayed the Board , a new calculation of charges for the waste water systems of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and under@@ cover from the previous calculation period will also be compensated .
the serious fees raised Schmidt thus explained that all three wastewater facilities were relatively small facilities with a very low waste of waste water , which was between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
due to the small distribution base , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
in addition , the amount of wastewater generated in all three systems is slightly decreasing .
furthermore , in the rec@@ u@@ per@@ ation period for all three plants , not least due to their age of rehabilitation and repair expenditure , they have fallen to a considerable extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p are almost 20 years old .
Schmidt asser@@ ted that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the wastewater treatment plant in Az@@ endorf .
in the pumping station Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground up and after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage treatment had to be extended , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation possibility to be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to these extraordinary expenses , the continued assistance and maintenance costs that have to be taken into account in the new calculation period came into consideration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were clearly below the current level in previous calculations in 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made it clear that in the case of low waste water waste in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully transparent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , Schmidt added that the market community has spar@@ ed great entertainment costs in the se@@ wer systems over the past 20 years .
according to stone houses , the situation for the mentioned systems will remain prec@@ arious in the long term , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal se@@ wer @-@ purpose association can not be extended by these facilities because they are defici@@ ent facilities .
Bulgaria books inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that in July inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first above zero since October last year , compared to positive 0.2 % .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 the following groups of consumer goods were observed in comparison to the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2,@@ 2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) .
prices remained as in the previous month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; effect as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critic@@ ised &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its Filter@@ tool Sn@@ ap@@ chat enables about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that already borders the absur@@ de .
you can transform yourself into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be a painting of Roy Licht@@ enstein .
the filters are bl@@ unt , self @-@ prop@@ elled tools that generate more than 30 million sel@@ fies a day .
all mis@@ carri@@ ages reach the public .
in the past Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have cri@@ tiqu@@ ed criticism in which they were accused of promoting the App Black face promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week suggested some users a filter that gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; Yellow face . &quot;
they asked themselves whether these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity .
the news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat informed that it would have disabled the feature .
the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended as a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders , who have experienced racism , reminded the filter of hur@@ t@@ ful c@@ lich@@ és .
others declined the anim@@ e @-@ comparison decisi@@ vely .
in an email , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American student of art , whose tweet about the photos were widely used to make the filter &quot; vulnerable and the least unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ si@@ ghted , but that the yellow face has been moved into the sliding extrem@@ ity .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company to cross this cultural stum@@ bling block .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand .
and sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older opponents - could assume more of their sensitivity .
when one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats &quot; filters creates a picture that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such things stay un@@ noticed than it was before , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who works as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium to delete their Sn@@ ap@@ chat account , asked others to do the same .
in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview , she said that she believes race @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the modeling practices of Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the largely white , only male leadership and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable in order to say what to do about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that Sn@@ ap@@ chat largely left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , Sn@@ ap@@ chat declined to discuss the cultural background of its staff , but according to a speaker , the company recently hired a personnel manager to focus on under@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu said she will let her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account be closed and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership distorted IS@@ IS secret service information , establishes board of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command altered intelligence information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as the actual conditions on the ground were allowed , an investigation committee of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday .
the provisional report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the Republi@@ can Committee , Intelligence Committee and the Ar@@ med Forces Com@@ mit@@ es , reports of great dis@@ content under Central Command Intelligence An@@ di@@ aly@@ sts , who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments of the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , briefly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence , typically super@@ se@@ ded by high @-@ level Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly recorded a positive image of American efforts against terrorism when the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; asked Ken Cal@@ vert , a Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives .
the management errors in the Cent@@ com range to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct indication that government tops have given orders under Obama to change the reports , it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat posed by the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 many Central Command , press releases , statements and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than it corresponds to the facts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; noted the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could commen@@ ce in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement .
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command &apos;s leaders changed the intelligence reports to down@@ play the danger posed by IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be supplemented by more detailed insights , while the investigations will continue .
in addition , further investigations in the Cent@@ com report are underway by the Ministry of Defense &apos;s general inspec@@ tor .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the Republi@@ can Task Force &apos;s conclusions .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ com created an over@@ ly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the highest ranking demo@@ crat in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compensated the moral among analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave excessive space for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of the White House interven@@ ing with the Cent@@ com analy@@ st regarding a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the proceedings of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon &apos;s general inspec@@ tor , who were contacted by Cent@@ Com analy@@ st complaints .
Mr. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congress , while the investigations of the general inspec@@ tor are still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions about the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the ministry of defence greet a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being done by a growing number of members of the Department of Defense ) .
the accus@@ ations of the past year however raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret information on the Islamic State is reminiscent of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush , contrary to the recommendations of many analysts , fores@@ aw only a small occupation force in Iraq and did not pre@@ tend to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker announced that contrary to the government &apos;s statements , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provisional refin@@ eries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
this recognition , however , was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ Com Commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the Legisl@@ ative Assembly for its over@@ ly positive assessment of the situation during a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at the Central Command .

both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first placed will take the strong Dutch a little longer out of the way the other group will lead .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , the American women have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex through their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and for the first time she had a ho@@ ckey player in her hands ( her two older sisters played sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , at 16 years she became a national player in the United States , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the Ka@@ der .
then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team everything went wrong .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the national team and thus began to turn things better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the work@@ space in London that we now have .
we have completely ro@@ cked the ru@@ dder .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the doors in the first half of the game with a draw from the local area .
India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she completed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the center and le@@ ap@@ ed the ball to the gate to give the American women a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the U.S. gate keeper , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
in the middle of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games .
Rio de Janeiro &apos;s events feel constantly and in@@ es@@ capable , a fast relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod that is passed from w@@ rist@@ watch to s@@ wimm@@ ers to turn to a tri@@ athlete .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Bal@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the controversy between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a s@@ warm of women with dim@@ ples , could certainly have been among the well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising , if he was a swi@@ mmer , gymn@@ ast or even fen@@ cers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
further from the centre , partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted : pi@@ geon shooting , ar@@ cher@@ y , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast @-@ swimming and may it rule for a long time .
but if I should make modest arguments for my particular favourite , let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline .
although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines have been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it was in Sydney , the last 16 years have been so sc@@ ary that many of them I had questioned did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to the competition , it has never won a medal on the trampoline and until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their Gold Med@@ al from London this year .
the jumping on the trampoline has some kind of out@@ sider @-@ charm , partly because it sounds more appropriate for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a d@@ ented enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending impact - but also the gra@@ zing of gymn@@ asti@@ cs and diving , the two sports that are essentially united .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El re@@ bo@@ under , meaning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
asp@@ iring winner jumping on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and must shoot a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ ons ) before they land on their feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the official Olympic programme , they are assessed according to the design , degree of difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women will compete against each other in Rio .
the common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ ons have to go further , faster , up and down in their quest for gold , sometimes down to the finish , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and down , upwards and down@@ wards on the playground .
they not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but also another highlight in television transmission : that of the world or the Olympic @-@ record .
the pur@@ pos@@ eful effort is pos@@ h , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to stir even one viewer to tears .
but it &apos;s also what I consider to be somewhat ti@@ ring when looking at these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back up .
there is also a contest here , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is so Zen like the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
the women &apos;s qualification and final rounds will be held on Friday afternoon , at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 1 pm .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final hours as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.@@ 00 .
in the middle of the Olympics @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably overlooked in general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the fear and objectiv@@ ity of male athletes - as the male US Tur@@ ner recently proposed , according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits his new fan community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the US &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators calling for political changes in Ethiopia met with the government &apos;s violent opposition .
witnesses testify that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police at shot changes .
is Ethiopia just collap@@ sing ?
in the last ten years , it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week thousands of people stre@@ amed into the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organizations , the government &apos;s response was ru@@ th@@ less .
witnesses testified that polic@@ emen shot and killed nin@@ ety @-@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
the videos circul@@ ating around the protests , probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Agency is now calling for a detailed investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the director of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa in Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethi@@ op@@ ians to fight terrorist haz@@ ards beyond the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a remarkable pace .
his infrastructure has dr@@ astically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been cur@@ tail@@ ed , wherein dissi@@ dents have been effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the vast@@ ness of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; if you op@@ press people and have no other options other than prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiopia .
the entire youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding power of the ruling coalition .
following a widely critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the parliament .
at the same time , tensions continue along the border with Erit@@ rea ; a struggle for this sha@@ ky , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the O@@ ga@@ den National Liberation Front , who were more or less forced over the last few years , could use tur@@ mo@@ il and arm themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess explo@@ de after years of going down under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
it was only in recent years that many Ethi@@ op@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , as cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more common and the internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are .
several young Ethi@@ op@@ ians sent that they were gathered together .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two biggest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia mainly Christian high @-@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of whom are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but that is also changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which constitute about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was in Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years .
he was seen as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in recognizing early signs of dis@@ content and using special officers to manipul@@ ate opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen from relatively obsc@@ ure reasons in order to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such an uph@@ eav@@ al in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , which , according to data from analysts , apparently were pla@@ gu@@ ed by the government and then stolen .
during the following ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even if it was less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as their meas@@ urable progress in fighting poverty .
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure of the Ethi@@ op@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , attacked by Tig@@ ray , and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in the social media .
analysts say that the US and other Western allies bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for D@@ ron@@ en@@ ic flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if it recently announced that it closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin balancing act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp asser@@ ts his claim that IS@@ IS was founded &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by ang@@ ining that his repeated alle@@ gation , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fication posed new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ can candidate , whether he is able to communicate clearly and understand@@ ably with the American public .
it also brings his comrades who seek to protect him during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position of decl@@ aring statements that he could not have meant .
after making the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp came back with regards to the statement on Thursday and insi@@ sted that he really did not intend to indicate that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning dew on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the tweet was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation was completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tru@@ mp to mitig@@ ate the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it .
the last storm of criticism falls down to Mr. Tru@@ mp while trying to focus his campaign because of falling demand values on the economic situation .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp tried again to return to this subject .
talking about Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tru@@ mp already presented sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
at the end of July he critic@@ ised himself when he thought that the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained , &quot; Of course , I thought of sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic borders in politics and then to ru@@ e as required .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his ways to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans , how they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction drops out . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates .
but I also think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tru@@ mp assumed an even more corro@@ sive tone , as his survey values continued to decline .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday , showed a leading lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tru@@ mp is generally trying not to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he frequently acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour .
but while empha@@ sizing the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp Scher@@ ze gave his loy@@ alist sympath@@ iz@@ ers to the uncomfortable situation , no matter how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , had great difficulty in defending the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Gi@@ uli@@ ani asked him about the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp &apos;s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them h@@ amm@@ ers , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of Foreign Affairs , allowed IS@@ IS to spread by subj@@ ecting the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively .
before the elections in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media , preten@@ ding to look around and be taken against him on any of his words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mo@@ cked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , j@@ amm@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the demo@@ crats ap@@ ologi@@ zed about Mr. Tru@@ mp &apos;s ap@@ ology as a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
once disp@@ l@@ aces the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point comes back
Ver@@ b Cafe was a fo@@ ggy cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash that didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , due to the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front .
soap in the summer of 2014 So@@ ap Cher@@ ie sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
indigenous drunk it as the last loss in an themselves gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is excluded and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is change , then it &apos;s also a new invention .
a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ time employee of the old coffee shop , the owner and managing director of the new coffee shop .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a client offered him to provide funds for a new outside office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept many things .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els buying the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ n@@ ations like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ced onions .
there are natural treasures .
the café does not serve beer any more , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also pushed out by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , used to live in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the club regularly .
even after being moved to Green@@ point , she would take the road .
after closing the verb , she gave up the coffee bar for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized it was on the coffee and the culture in the Ver@@ b that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on this day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal was another long @-@ standing and loyal client .
he went there before the work and in@@ vari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came fourth after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had no res@@ ent@@ ment over the fact that the soap business took the old business room .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered to make a special soap with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of coffee bar as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go to her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish residents of Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has prepared to leave it soon , so that his new neighbours will feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice local would like to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into the bottles .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to a neighbouring building .
for many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension to the president Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a gourmet , President Roosevelt had a fai@@ ble for sophisticated delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on this day was slightly more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to Americans as they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both grocery stores .
Co@@ es &apos;s latest book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; dealt with Chinese cuisine in the U.S. , while bri@@ ck@@ man in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; tells about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the food perspective .
her latest collaboration , &quot; An decent meal , &quot; published on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , fri@@ lls in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mix ate .
when the re@@ porter ordered Hack@@ ney it found the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression .
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; he said .
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and B@@ ohn@@ en@@ brot .
they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; it must have been in the stomach such as lead , &quot; he said .
in the years prior to the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ Buffet .
teams of women cooked for male fel@@ lows and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records the ways with which the country was changing to be no longer the Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when eating for Americans was a central , intense issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food , such as bre@@ ads and d@@ ow@@ ls , became stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way to reuse food residue , &quot; says Ziegel@@ man , as coo@@ ks were able to hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rarely served luxury .
strange mixtures were tried , as a cal@@ orie rich and nour@@ ishing grati@@ fication took preced@@ ence over flavor or even healthy dishes .
while resear@@ ching the book , which includes recipes , Bri@@ ck@@ man prepared a dish from this time , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition to lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions are not compatible with each other .
it was typical for many of the home business recipes .
as never before or ever since , budget@@ ary econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - drove up the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ wives &quot; and the challenge of turning pamp@@ as such as cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historical delicacies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially tasty are the reports on the government &apos;s response to the hungry citizens , as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ C@@ ake @-@ eating attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa rural kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke as the million@@ aire man of the world he has become .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he liked Continental food like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully strange .
President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to take an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the hypo@@ cris@@ y of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosevelt said that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
many of the species from the era of the Great Depression , deal with food was rejected as soon as the country returned to its feet .
the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as how science has been applied to food .
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example , how she could not throw food away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a real fear of food waste , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you actually made people sick &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the vor@@ tex of the wind .
after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the p@@ um @-@ seed dessert that President Roosevelt ate at mid@@ day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man and added that it was a common trick to give modest recipes a chic name . &quot; &quot; &quot;

he put his own life into the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died even in the Assad regime &apos;s drum bomb attack .
O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil defence group that , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60,000 people life .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own life into play in order to draw people out of bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the area of war .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil prot@@ ector , showing him in an 11 @-@ hour rescue from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians a shining symbol in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a hero , he never saw himself , but he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die , I think that God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .

Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland sh@@ arks mostly come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland sh@@ arks only get offspring with 150 years of offspring .
lei@@ surely the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms down at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes on average just 1,@@ 220 feet wide .
only when it arrives , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates to a sat@@ anic 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
the lifestyle em@@ bos@@ sed by slow@@ ness seems to be a pan@@ ac@@ ea for a high age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Science &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from a Greenland @-@ shar@@ k , who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock comment@@ ates this life @-@ margin , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , the evolution bi@@ ologist presum@@ ed long that Greenland &apos;s hair will be st@@ ony .
only the evidence was missing .
Greenland sh@@ arks are difficult to observe , finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually only appear in the winter on the surface .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s hair .
their slow @-@ motion shows them , when they re@@ buried six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
this sh@@ arks nevertheless make this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
possibly they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and look for cad@@ a@@ vers coming from higher water @-@ layers down@@ wards .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sh@@ arks , the fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the largest was 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers .
to determine the age of the animals they analyzed with the carbon @-@ 14 method the lens core of the sh@@ arks .
this centre of the eye lens arises before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it are later no longer renewed .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
its birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons attempts to tow large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third smallest animal , with a length of 220 centimet@@ ers , the l@@ enti@@ cular nucleus , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons attempt , therefore it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in its investigation in 2012 .
all larger Greenland sh@@ arks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their l@@ enti@@ cular nucleus , which results from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ timeter long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers might be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers of the length were able to assign an age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood on the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland sh@@ arks with the multip@@ lication obviously leave at least one and a half centuries of time .
this is also likely to be a world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ y@@ al@@ ems live mainly in icy waters is not a coincidence .
the previous record holder , a 211 year old Greenland @-@ whale , in whose bac@@ on at the neck was a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on tip , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on as@@ par@@ ag@@ us .
so they mature later - and age slower .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are also often very big .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram of elephant .
another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal thus lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein .
a very big animal , on the other hand , should invest its resources in a long life .
building site in double pack
the Municipal Council has focused on topics related to construction in the most recent meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the panel was facilit@@ ated by the announcement of Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of recently designated residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the real estate , par@@ cel@@ li@@ ation and development issues have been clari@@ fied and the applications could be made on sur@@ veying , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; street road &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section Bin@@ der@@ straße - extension section 1 ) is nothing more in the way to interested parties .
the municipality is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au appeal to young families and other sen@@ iors alike .
as it was said , volunteers will be able to report to the Town Hall as of now . the municipal council is expected to advise the municipal council in its September meeting .
in order to also en@@ roll requests concerning the establishment of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the area of land use plan newly created in the spring of this year .
in the area of Unter@@ time@@ lar@@ n , the business area that has already been designated is extended by two plots towards the state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
as a result , the city of Main has the best opportunities to attract new jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Center of Excellence in Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether banks will continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU .
for the so @-@ called EU passport , the approval in the UK is enough for them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are using large US banks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
several banks have already announced to reloc@@ ate jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is expecting 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk category ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks because they can communicate so directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry , but also cuts down the infrastructure of Dublin as well as Dublin .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
further points are the city with easily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it &apos;s not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the Unternehmens@@ beratung Mer@@ cer , the city was ranked seventh , Luxemburg in number 19 , Dublin at number 33 and Paris in 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a location for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the I@@ W concludes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in spite of the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my econom@@ ists say .
in London according to figures from Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , at the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking industry , in Frankfurt , were 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US National Ju@@ dge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs incurred by the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co . Inc .
in June Gilead was freed from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were related to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the Mein@@ ei@@ des and other non @-@ ethical actions .
at the filing of the law@@ suit on Thursday , US Secretary Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to a reduction in costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck is trying to equ@@ alize Gilead to control the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck compla@@ ined and owned each other and took possession of laboratory work , to which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir landed , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
troops supported by the US say that they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
the US supported the full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j close to the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city have left them , a group spokes@@ man said on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) comb the city after the group of fighters remaining within the city .
they have freed more than 2,000 civilians , who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , shared the Reu@@ ters Military Council of Reu@@ ters who allied with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we are running clean @-@ up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday her tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the Democrats &apos; candidate and husband &apos;s income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , Clinton &apos;s USD 1 million donated $ 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton posted an income of USD 3 million from the Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for her book on her term at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ president , Senator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax statements for the last ten years along with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hero@@ in J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp hid behind false exc@@ uses and back@@ sli@@ ders in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax statements .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , although they are not oblig@@ ated by law because of this .
Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers , as a reason for his refusal , have given a tax check by the tax authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the move , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s campaign hero@@ in Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , regarding the publication of the Democrats &quot; candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tru@@ mp special advis@@ er , told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before the tax inspections are not completed .
Tru@@ mps critics , among others also the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already vo@@ iced that his refusal to raise questions regarding wealth , its donations for charitable organisations , his business forms and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton had already over@@ thrown the subject and posted a video on the Internet on Friday in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp demands to publish his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke about the topic during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done over the last decades and publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
politicians have reported that during the 1990s , Tru@@ mp has paid no or very little taxes , and an economic journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers on Friday , the indications that this could still be the case .
in the election campaign , federal taxes have become a subject .
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka , Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its seat here , asked Tru@@ mp for a meeting to exchange their tax declarations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; buff@@ ett said he had been subjected to a tax audit of the I@@ RS and Tru@@ mp was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; afraid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax return to the year 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an average annual tax rate of around 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of around 4@@ 0.5 % .
the tax return of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that they had only USD 100 of their income as wages , unlike the majority of Americans .
their major investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and income from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ powder , fire@@ work bodies promote dance ani@@ as elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going into settlements inhabited by people - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ ili@@ es .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea for years , has intensified its support together with the U.S. natural protection , by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , using a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their houses and harv@@ ests without hur@@ ting animals .
before that , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the day of the world , dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitudes within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; said the director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dami@@ an Bell in a message .
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jewish director sm@@ ashes Berliner Hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media clock after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israel &apos;s pre @-@ election as it had claimed Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country &apos;s list of countries .
however , the country was not listed between the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel through its own call center .
after an explanation , the director addressed the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel staff said that the measure was &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel management . &quot;
the reason behind it , triggered even more anger in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the pre @-@ election is extingu@@ ished , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big shame , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater shame .
there is no need for explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a pretty big resonance on the internet , where people called it a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indul@@ ged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleged demands of Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it said in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located on the clas@@ sy Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is close to a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to not include Israel in the quick @-@ election list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has been added .
police uses tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met on Thursday in the Brazilian town of Sao Paulo with the police when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police introduced tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began , as police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led to the introduction of rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor of the federal state Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money .
some of the protest@@ ors saw Gra@@ ffi@@ tits having spra@@ yed against the preliminary President Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the recent protests happened a few days after demonstr@@ ators walked into the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff who had been dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trading between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador to Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Te@@ hr@@ an in the year @-@ on @-@ year rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest in Russian companies grew strongly on businesses in the country , shared the ambass@@ adors .
Russian companies are taking up existing links with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further commercial expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euro@@ monitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade boom was reached by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan sur@@ passes a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , Russian representatives presented some 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of tourist numbers in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record figures of Iranian tourists in Russia last year were broken , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only a few Russians are visiting Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said .
searched for : beverage market flooded into forest fires
a rob@@ ber@@ y attack on Thursday evening has been practi@@ sed at the Be@@ we XXL beverage market at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the restra@@ int of a fire@@ arm , three dark @-@ dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ med up their faces from the staff of the beverage market , demanded the return of cash and then fled at first on foot and then probably with a silver coloured VW Golf .
how much money has been exploited does not share the police with them .
the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 metres , thus relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market and is badly visible .
after the attack , the perpetr@@ ators must be taken to Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and have escaped from the gravel car park situated opposite the parking garage with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly in direction B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .

eight beautiful and happy days the children and young people of the social pedago@@ gical day group / social group work of the child protection bun@@ ny Nag@@ old with their supervis@@ ors spent their summer holidays in N@@ uss@@ dorf close to Müh@@ lack@@ er .
the life @-@ joyful group was quartered in the quiet Lei@@ tw@@ ül@@ ste leisure centre during the first week of school .
several full @-@ day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand , it went to B@@ end with the visit of the pet@@ ting zoo .
on the other side to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guidance in the world famous monastery .
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days the group enjoyed the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited for jumping , swimming and sp@@ lashing .
children and car@@ ers with their self @-@ made body@@ guards like the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ itt@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese were spoiled for culinary purposes .
workshops were made , beautiful jewellery made of beads and stones or made of wood a Roman @-@ mill game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; further highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings on the fire and the final &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Color@@ ful evening &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the day of departure the sun laugh@@ ed and the children and young people returned home satisfied .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrimage to the gate of mercy
the mini@@ stran@@ ts from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna travelled to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage route from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
four stages were met together .
in order to bridge the time until the next Rom@@ s@@ pilgrimage of all mini@@ stran@@ ts in a period of two years , the high @-@ minist@@ erial round of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage destinations have been tested and finally decided for the Ep@@ is@@ cop@@ al city of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of mercy , with the gateway to the Freiburg cathedral , a special pilgrimage destination was offered .
16 Min@@ is , of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the holy rooms , went on their way .
in the evening before , Fr . Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ m Cross and divided the Pil@@ gri@@ mage .
from Hor@@ b was driven by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster ever@@ ser@@ er is standing and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was started .
the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse with different prayers , songs and written texts .
but also on the way , the min@@ is at field crosses , chap@@ els or churches repeatedly called R@@ ast to sing a song from a specially composed pilgri@@ m song .
parish halls of the local par@@ ishes were available for overnight stays .
on the stages Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller provided tasty as well as strong dinners and breakfast .
we continued on the second day about Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the day after that , one entered the stage to St. Peter , which was the most stren@@ uous route , but at the same time some 500 al@@ timet@@ ers had to be desc@@ ended and then climbed again .
the deserved reward was a common cri@@ cket at the bathroom in the evening .
after the morning pul@@ s on the fourth pilgrimage day in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , it went to the closing stage to Freiburg .
the min@@ is were visi@@ bly facilit@@ ated and happy later in the afternoon at Frei@@ burger Mu@@ en@@ ster and walked through the gate of mercy .
with a little impulse God was given thanks .
Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t was welcomed at the evening mass in Münster .
after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to see the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite Gold is awarded for cycling
Schot@@ t@@ lands Call@@ um Sk@@ inner &apos;s last evening in the men &apos;s team @-@ Sprint in Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame , when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the pi@@ vot@@ al role that his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place in London despite the return of Ho@@ ys in March .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the An@@ dri@@ ers Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a return .
Ho@@ ys retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man they stayed with when they saw the potential in the Sc@@ ots that has un@@ folded .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y prevailed - and Sk@@ inner prevailed in the qualification laps , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ der fell short after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation that took place in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
Ho@@ y looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old winner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for me .
we have set up an Olympic board in the final round and the World Champion is defeated .
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on Kenn@@ y &apos;s and Ho@@ ys side , he admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track .
he returned this statement later and there was no objection of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like London with all the UK flags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we &apos;ve come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if that &apos;s a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in cycle power .
with the form Kenn@@ y it is in the range of possible that he won the victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
this would be for Kenn@@ y - exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int that starts today and is going for three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should become a k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometer race .
they arrived at the finish in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record that won gold in London 2012 was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition where Wig@@ gins will focus on safety .
he had cont@@ ested yesterday with representatives before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his body size .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will continue tomorrow and end , Laura advanced , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK team relies on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a band of med@@ als .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
drama played in the background , as the resignation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical director in April surrounded by sex and mo@@ bbing issues as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks as if the legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which reaches its zen@@ ith at the perfect moment , will be repeated again .
future of Port@@ land melt due to the lifting of the energy contract
the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs by workers - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus canc@@ els all supply contracts , as the supply energy company communicated .
this step followed the government &apos;s decision to invest in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years runs out in November .
up to 2,000 jobs in the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk in a closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects , as the melting plant uses around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victori@@ as .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa joined the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer@@ ei , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks closure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , informed that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller portions .
&quot; AG@@ L expects that the plant in Port@@ land will continue to operate , which means further physical demand for electricity by melting glaci@@ ers , &quot; said the company .
AG@@ L also stated that the contracts were called &quot; hed@@ ging transactions , &quot; which should have entered into force from November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the supplier of electricity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on AG@@ L revenues as of the G@@ J 18 is currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L stated that the value of the contracts had already been written down in its annual subscription to the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ ility Al@@ co@@ as ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will not be impaired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said it had completed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang that would have entered into force from November this year even if it is still a statement of why it has res@@ igned from the contract .
analysts warn of the industry &apos;s poor economic conditions before the potential closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
referring to the analysts &quot; statements at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts per year to consume around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity every year .
if both systems were to disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator it wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner clan Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran to fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote .
the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or just keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , descri@@ p@@ tive reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( except for the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular show bi@@ z @-@ uncle and producer of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , which ends with a classic turn : they all planned a surprise party .
this is the c@@ lich@@ és of nearly every birthday party of a child &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to somehow take part in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began with certainty .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim may have sm@@ itten what the vo@@ gue cover is concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league of itself .
the September issue is the most sold out of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference that resembles an illustrated book as a fashion magazine , the issue attracted a large number of advertis@@ ers ( Accor@@ ding Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were 6@@ 15 pages of advertising from the 8@@ 32 pages of the Wäl@@ zer ) .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover stars is so eag@@ erly anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the Bulletin still transp@@ i@@ red before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties that model@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ Prize lau@@ re@@ ate and brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but even with the little chance that Ms Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of her generation - falls under the earlier category , she is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
celeb@@ ri@@ ties aren &apos;t related to celeb@@ ri@@ ties or celeb@@ ri@@ ties from today who know how to shoot a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if all of them apply to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who exc@@ el in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers ple@@ ases success not everyone .
with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always somewhat ten@@ se .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed them and called them &quot; The Mi@@ sts of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings boiled down again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but on the face of mis@@ fortune seems to pass by at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she works for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters sell images of themselves on their pay@@ wall apps .
she sells pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the Magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is in Reality TV . presumably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
community centres annually show 160@@ ,000 people
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s auxiliary premises are rejected annually by the local government centres , while the industry is making an impact on the effects of further mid @-@ term cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no funds for unfair dele@@ tions and similar - are rejected at their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ hau@@ led , are ready for further cuts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from June next year , it is fores@@ een that these legal centres will lose more than 30 percent of their federal funding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the Que@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ rell metrop@@ olitan areas said that the last survey of the National Association of Public Research Centr@@ es found that thousands of people have already been rejected every year .
Far@@ rell said that without an ann@@ ul@@ ment of the resolution of the Federal Government , the situation would only get worse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been un@@ just dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they can &apos;t get the help they need .
from June 2017 , the federal government will cut funds by 30 percent , which means that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we urge the General Prosecutor and Justice Minister and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately cancel these mid @-@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their communities , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tru@@ mp election campaign charges after employee re@@ port@@ edly tigh@@ tened weapons
new York : Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s campaign has been indic@@ ted for alleged in@@ action after reporting that her campaign manager for North Carolina had a fire@@ arm on a staff while she was traveling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment , which was filed on Wednesday at the State Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ordin@@ i admitted to have waited for months to regulate the matter internally before he realised that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign manager , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drew a pi@@ sto@@ l , laid his right foref@@ inger on the badge , and ra@@ mmed the run into Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave B@@ ordin@@ i his charge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having compla@@ ined to local and regional campaign management , B@@ ord@@ i stated that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he admitted to the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered an uph@@ eav@@ al when he said a crowd in North Carolina , that the Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arms and arms friends - should take action if his rival to H@@ illary Clinton and judges should appoint .
Tru@@ mp &apos;s campaign clearly stated that the media would have torn his words out of context and that he would not inc@@ ite violence .
ordin@@ is Com@@ pla@@ int demands compensation from the campaign for the violation of due diligence and from Philip because of bodily injury and lasting emotional damage .
Tru@@ mps spokes@@ man Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for a statement .
attempts to contact Philip also failed .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign .
responding to calls from his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , was not responsive .
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp has so far led a controversial campaign .
the procedure is b@@ ord@@ i by Donald J. Tru@@ mp for President Inc . , 16 @-@ CS @-@ 14@@ 300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) .
Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey in front of country elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) considerable losses for the governing party SPD and CD@@ U are notable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this resulted in representative surveys by the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition in the North could no longer go@@ vern , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and thus would have good chances of continuing to head the head of the government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD dropped from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party only sm@@ iled shortly before the CD@@ U , which could return to 23 percent .
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the parliament .
the Green Party returned to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag despite light losses of 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented in the Land@@ tag by 3 per cent respectively .
according to the survey , the German Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) claimed only 23 per cent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 per cent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they are still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but on the left at 15 percent ( formerly 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Af@@ D would be represented at 14 percent for the first time in the House of Dep@@ uties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would not miss the move in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : Nokia Communic@@ ator entered the market 20 years ago .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his maker experienced a disaster .
the unit weighed almost half a kilogra@@ m and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ ums@@ y .
the built @-@ in storage was initially eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would suff@@ ice today for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; occurred exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in stores - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros , lovers can buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
twenty years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer trade fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; office in western pocket format &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , the new mobile phone could have a lot for those standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even via fax was the communic@@ ator .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , albeit tra@@ gically slow .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then we found a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could have gu@@ essed in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s &apos; mobile phone line experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold to Microsoft and handled .
today , the market is dominated by suppliers who came much later than Nokia .
being online anytime and anywhere , this is a lot of everyday life for a lot of people today .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphones in the world .
about 1.4 billion devices have been sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units .
worldwide sales of the equipment are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless apps providers and the telecommunications companies .
a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone in the meantime .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , then Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones on the Mac @-@ World .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communication , easy to use by touch screen .
the Apple &apos;s trium@@ ph@@ al procession began , and today , the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had a look .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
on average every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn to move the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens Management Board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
long @-@ term accessibility is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time .
England must bring Olympic spirit and He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country .
for me it was the biggest attraction He@@ a@@ throws , just like in 2012 in London , when we ran a lot of effort to make sure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we already have 10,000 new apprenti@@ ces for our local communities , creating 40,000 new jobs and putting an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as they were ahead of London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement lifting is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ aming on the world stage .
the two @-@ f@@ ellers were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong even at He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ a@@ throw answers any question asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project .
enlargement is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion of wit@@ ty growth and leaving a legacy of skills and jobs in both the airport and throughout the UK .
we have a great team at He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - five years in succession to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to the T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the two most popular cat@@ walks in the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
London &apos;s 2012 games were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ a@@ throw &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz @-@ und Maus@@ spiel &quot; regarding ad block@@ age
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , one of the software manufacturers attempts to avoid ad block@@ ings , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block indicating block@@ ages on its desktop , Ad@@ block Plus released a blo@@ gger in which users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertisements in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that his desktop page would change the coding for his advertisements to make it difficult to detect notices about which part of the page advertising is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her battle between the ti@@ dal open source community and the conver@@ ters has been going on since the invention of scor@@ ching block@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and it is possible that Facebook soon comes up with a new solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered into the struggle is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicator lamps have become the industry .
according to a study published last year by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people use display lock@@ ers ; almost four times so much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertis@@ ers &quot; Fac@@ ebooks .
the company has been blocking advertising block@@ ers on desktop PCs , as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , distributed a speaker .
advertising on desktop PCs causes a sufficiently large share of revenues , so that Facebook appears to be worth the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ad Pre@@ ference Initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give people more control over adverti@@ sed advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block was wor@@ rying new filters because they would also block contents on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook speaker in an e @-@ mail message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a dum@@ b tool , which is why we have instead focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences in order to put more control into the hands of the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; woman with a suspected suicide on the Swiss motorway &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call witnesses after a woman was driving on a highway during the early hours of the morning on Thursday with a suspected suicide of several vehicles .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman lay down in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 , who was over@@ run by several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , wanted to kill himself .
she still died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police told them , as well as any witnesses of the incident to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter distributed to Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers are not responsible .
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian flows in the middle of the night on the motorway , as stated in the newspaper .
last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing after crossing a man and killed a man lying near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and was unconscious in the street , took the court .
the Court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- proc@@ eeded to a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus once hab@@ itable
the Venus was probably inhabited according to projections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have re@@ ared with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have already pointed out that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly turned on .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet presumably pointed out more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to house life and protected from fast evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also prof@@ ited from a sun , which was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the ISS modeling simulation the slow turn of the Venus will expose its daylight side of the sun for nearly two months , &quot; stated G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield off the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus , which resembles the evolution previously assumed by planet explor@@ ers .
although initially hab@@ itable , Venus -- over the course of several billion years --@@ exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans evap@@ or@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned away from ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen just left a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy performs as trainer of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led a too low co @-@ determination right in the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
alternatively President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately search for a new trainer .
&quot; over the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as Chief Executive Officer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion .
during the summer , I &apos;ve been thinking about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , it needs and bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the Vision of the trainer and vice president of ho@@ ckey operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation .
it must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy was awarded the best trainer in the league during his debut season at the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award .
he led the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed in each of the last two years the post@@ season .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal @-@ Canadi@@ en and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ labour@@ ers resume talks , put on strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles for the remuneration for North Sea oil workers are suspended , while all the parties stand for a new round of talks to the table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wood Group and the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the current strike , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will stop some full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks , which will start the beginning of next year to address the problems again .
the unions said their last strike , which is the first in more than 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its counter@@ tops in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressures .
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 % decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts will give the company the required space to come through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the UK energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure because of the lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was reinforced by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish parliament member Dave Anderson met with leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest work disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and across the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion in expenses for new projects in the North Sea are expected to be around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the cluster of the ple@@ j@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers gather the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates beneath the stars of the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data will help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars rotate in cluster formation to different rates as well as in what context the rotation periods are associated with planetary formation .
&quot; we hope that through comparing our results with other con@@ stell@@ ations , we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light @-@ years distant from the Earth .
many stars in this cluster of stars , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ thood .
they are now turning the fastest .
at peak rot@@ ational rates , these mature stars po@@ ke large amounts of star@@ ches .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star fails , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a visible star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the newest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more mass@@ aging stars turn more slowly than less solid stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars spinning more slowly pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
since the con@@ stellation of the ple@@ j@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is still a lot to learn about how , when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang up their &quot; dancing shoes &quot; so to speak .
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the P@@ lei@@ ades rot@@ ational rates , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial Bas@@ eball star will kick off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base zu Base .
after his emotional resignation , the 41 year old pro will wear the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on August 12 against T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say goodbye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star @-@ game participant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) declared .
three times , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected to the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has been giving him 27 million US dollars a year since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will in future serve as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary .
as a player Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 Points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two more bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics .
however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should nevertheless not be absorbed into the bas@@ eball hall of the bas@@ eball .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for so successfully Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field , so its appearance is outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star admitted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which banned ster@@ oids from 2001 to 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 he was closed for 211 games because of an involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ genesis sc@@ andal .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the prime suspect for years to have received powerful funds through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a dispute the barrier was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; the league could even have done me a favor in 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at that time sweet .
even his farewell days do not run sil@@ ently .
while many bas@@ eball legends have once again received the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a goodbye tour . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az , and the relationship with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson said , sympathy @-@ compli@@ ments of fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Arch@@ du@@ als Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the fans sang at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympics 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases
caught : due to a positive dop@@ ing sample , weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio will not start .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing attacks .
a wi@@ ped athlete had won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing events have become known in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese swimming act@@ ress Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter steep@@ le in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the already critically acclaimed athle@@ tics competitions this news came to an end .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de was demonstrated last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Court of Sport CA@@ S confirmed its expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butter@@ flies , only 0.@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en should have participated in the runs over 50 m of fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested an opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demands full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message saying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will work together with the International Criminal Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
also during the night of Rio the news spread about the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the athlete . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , the banned substance should be the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was suspended preliminary , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should have already had a positive effect .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately spoke to the athlete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation may not participate in Rio .
on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , was tested as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier positive on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
they both take the in@@ gest@@ ation , both of them are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
before starting athletes , the Dan@@ ek@@ ova case is another heavy blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the World Federation ( IA@@ AF ) banned the entire Russian team up to an exception due to systematic dop@@ ing , and Kenya &apos;s L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nos produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming sport , the earlier tensions in China also caused fierce controversi@@ es between the athletes .
thus the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium over 200 m of fre@@ estyle , I want to commit myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t on the French Radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also the focus of an engagement with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing fraud , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was tested positively by the Chinese nation@@ als in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant of Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to sit on a three @-@ month lock .
data @-@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de presses hack@@ ers her ran@@ som
programmers of black@@ mail malware are currently targeting specific companies - and are successful in doing so .
according to a recent survey conducted by the malware Defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ io under 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies reported at least once in the past twelve months , sometimes multiple victims of an attack using black@@ mail software .
in Germany , nearly 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 per cent of the victims readily paid the dele@@ tions required by the perpetr@@ ators to recover the challenged systems and data .
the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes to attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potential for rede@@ em@@ ing ran@@ som is significantly higher than for private users .
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ io chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski talking to the &quot; world . &quot;
in 2008 most of the malware programs were designed to send advertising .
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
only private users were the target , but the change to company att@@ aches was frigh@@ tening quickly over the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware operates according to a simple pattern : once activated on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for un@@ modified files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
subsequently the software presents the recei@@ v@@ ables of the black@@ mail .
to get the final turn code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin .
but where private users have the personal photo database on the game , companies are interested in sensitive customer data or project databases without the production being shut down .
accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware hits .
22 per cent of affected German companies reported revenue losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely inter@@ rupt the operation , in one case , people were in danger of life .
in Germany several hospitals were already victims of attacks , whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only have the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay will get their data back .
for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of down@@ time in operation .
the h@@ acker in turn know this and try everything to build up a good reputation .
in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure explored the user interfaces and contact with the black@@ mail users and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims using chat on how they can pay per Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t example files for free .
and when individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euro , companies must deal with hard bar@@ gain and pay five @-@ figure sums to return their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , hack@@ ers are becoming more and more professional and share the work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware around within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons .
the programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software module to the actual black@@ mail .
the existing malware kits have been created by purchasing the malware itself , advice and additional tools for a one @-@ time fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; the scope of supply includes a adjustment tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be altered , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ mail@@ ers are then looking for more hack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
thus , one logs in one of the forums on the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment will be made per authenti@@ cated calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually the criminals then instruc@@ t sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski explains .
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ yte survey trust that they can rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful closure , the offen@@ ders instead threaten with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ io chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that , depending on the type of data , the potential for damage is much higher than before .
in future , the perpetr@@ ators could also completely new targets on the internet of things in the future .
at the h@@ acker conference Def@@ con , safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of winter the activation of such a blocked heater may well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , turns out to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the HR @-@ V is only 1.@@ 60 m high , the passengers have plenty of space in the first row and in the rear , it does not work nar@@ row@@ ly at any point .
the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , only the cockpit upper side falls off there .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a boot of 4@@ 53 l with raised and 10@@ 26 l back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical when it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a seat and thus offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the ground to the ceilings .
the trunk can be loaded easily , but the loading height is a little higher at 650 mm compared to the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he should make his work a bit qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but steering is likely to be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the safety systems include the City emergency braking system ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because it ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when manoeu@@ v@@ ring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent template responds to the traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed when needed .
but the full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI connector lie under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who do not want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 2@@ 3000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
airline is not liable : over@@ throwing on the passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Dus@@ sel@@ dorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued for a liability only in the case of dangers typical of air traffic .
the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken down a kne@@ ec@@ ap during the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
case of illness : when paid the Organ@@ izer
after their journey , holi@@ day@@ makers will only return money if the cause of the illness is to be found in the hotel without a doubt .
however , this is only the case if more than 10 percent of the guests are shown to show the same symptoms .
in the negotiated case , a family suffered severe diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their Turkish holiday .
she spent almost the whole holiday in the room .
their illness brought the tourists back to a defective sewage treatment plant , which allegedly poll@@ uted sea@@ water .
the family believed that the trip had been lacking - and compla@@ ined against the organizer .
the pla@@ inti@@ ffs had no success in court .
the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organizers only learned about it shortly before the departure of the pla@@ inti@@ ffs .
he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine .
so he did not inf@@ ringe his duty of information , so the judgment .
especially since no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said after the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have worried about further attacks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state must be pru@@ dent and resol@@ ute to react to terrorist operations at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sure is : our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hate and division .
we won &apos;t allow this triumph to the terrorists .
if offen@@ ders had to leave the country more quickly , this increases security and strengthens the approval of the population for refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals until the Bundestag election 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced further personal rein@@ for@@ cements of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in medium four @-@ digit order over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy advertising for terrorism must be punished again &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance needs to be improved , the tru@@ ce will be revised so that the purchase of weapons on the internet is more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last much discussed duty of sec@@ rec@@ y for doctors is supposed to remain true to de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession , he wants to look for solutions that can reduce the risk of citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said with regard to mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act the radi@@ cal@@ isation of refugees , the Minister considers a better social support necessary .
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ zed people .
in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior clearly spoke against Action@@ ism .
&quot; that was an ear file for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had previously rejected calls from the Union after a bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double nationality .
it is constitu@@ tionally problematic for a general prohibition of full @-@ conce@@ al@@ ment .
you can &apos;t for@@ bid what you are rej@@ ecting , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ q@@ a .
you can talk about rules e.g. in road traffic or for witnesses in court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green Chief Simone Peter accused the minister that he wanted to simulate Tat@@ too and action with new anti @-@ terrorist acts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ wing party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet of Pro@@ verb@@ s and a tightening of the right of residence bring people in this country no more security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow at the motorway
&quot; &quot; &quot; it st@@ ews itself regularly on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Um@@ geh@@ ungs@@ straße &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - here a picture of November . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that is to change : the legal ab@@ bey should be extended .
this is good news for all the drivers of the car , who are standing in traffic jam every night in traffic jams when driving over the highway of the Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
road construction will be extended on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Road and the exit Wes@@ el Straße the right lane bending road by 700 meters .
drivers can then turn right from the Hammer road to the right .
the big advantage : traffic spl@@ its up early , thus improving the overall sequence on the busy section of the federal highway 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the District Church of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder nerves the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ days from the back@@ stage to the bridge over the Alber@@ go trail and sometimes even beyond .
the reason for this is the con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous cave on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ el Straße .
from here , traffic is only lowered by one lane via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built back over a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge has no longer the required load capacity to record heavy traffic in two @-@ lane traffic .
the competent national company cannot say how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the related traffic jam will continue .
however , with years to come , the bridge has an official remaining useful life up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal ab@@ bi@@ dity , the state enterprise deliberately chose the less traffic @-@ less time during the school holidays because of disability .
traffic will be run on Tuesday and Wednesday without a lane at the construction site .
intercultural Travel : cultural Activities for Schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the forest school children &apos;s house has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Young Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s , 19 students from 11 to 15 years visited the staging in the small house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
most youths of the class have come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and speak little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action nevertheless , such as the press release of the Young Theater Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from spra@@ w@@ ling , and the young theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project .
from October to December young people with and without escape and migration background are supposed to have the opportunity to attend professionally guided classes in the areas of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; continues .
in view of the increased number of refugees , the association expects many classes who want to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement
the weather has made the shooting star Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany on the night to Friday a stroke of the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to observe the heavenly spectacle , said the chair@@ person of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope lies on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we will see many shooting stars in the sky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ schu@@ ppen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is about Per@@ sei@@ ds , which are one of the fastest shooting stars at 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us coming up in the north @-@ east .
rest@@ ful night : tips for sleep disorders
in the evening , one rolls around etern@@ ally , at night one is awake for hours , in the morning it is not possible to think long before the wake @-@ up ring .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep problems manifest ?
there are several types of sleep disorders , and there can be a variety of reasons for them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ aving , member of the German Society for Sle@@ eping and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what you understand for the time being , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. a dor@@ man@@ t and dor@@ man@@ t distur@@ b@@ ance .
it is precisely the diar@@ rho@@ ea that many people experience as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , board member of the German Medical Association with practice in Var@@ el , Lower Saxony .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind this , organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines are stuck .
it is not rare that the sleep disorder is an expression of another disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is common especially in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors w@@ rest@@ le one another .
for example , if you have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , it can be bad , wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to pon@@ der about everyday problems and worries , give birth to an example .
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor , tell the doctor .
the impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is ab@@ beaten , tired , in@@ es@@ capable , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments like stomach or headache .
to allevi@@ ate sleeping disorder , it is important to find out the causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medicines - classic slaugh@@ tering tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
Dr. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary Doc@@ toral Medical Center at the Char@@ ité University Medical Center , Berlin , hardly exists in Germany .
therefore one should contact the family doctor in case of sleep problems , she advises her .
it can be clari@@ fied by examining whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep , and what happens ?
for the examination in the sleep laboratory , physicians advise , for example , in case of snor@@ ing with respiratory equipment , in case of disease fatigue , sleep@@ wal@@ kers , or if one does not find the cause of a dor@@ man@@ t disorder , Fi@@ etze explains .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the cl@@ acking , you go to bed at the normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ pair , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler on the finger .
in addition , a camera shows the sleeping @-@ ends at the ceiling .
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which one can sit for better sleep .
she is counting on : regular bed@@ time and stand @-@ up times , don &apos;t sleep too long in bed , don &apos;t sleep on the day , do not watch TV for sleeping , avoid alcohol and don &apos;t look at the clock at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is quite and not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp has to do with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has vo@@ iced his dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V @-@ Team at Olymp@@ us via Facebook .
in December 2014 he made gold for the first time at the World Cup in Doh@@ a and at the same time set his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ athlete Markus Dei@@ bler has protected himself against his ex @-@ team@@ mates in front of his critic@@ isms .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic winner gets 20,000 € bonus and a jungle @-@ king of 15@@ 0.000 € , nobody should be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page in the night on Friday .
the pumping system in swimming is bad , but dop@@ ing controls are very good .
this means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not see or even operate on dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be stopped here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he continued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be announced nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency in Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you can &apos;t control a certain amount of time before WM / OS from independent inspec@@ tors of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A , you must@@ n &apos;t take part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the election @-@ ham@@ burger , who meanwhile runs an ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : arrest of Bag@@ gage Lo@@ thi@@ eves arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
the arrest of two women and two men aged between the ages of 50 and 61 took place on Thursday .
the susp@@ ects had committed several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and luggage @-@ ste@@ els as a gang .
at 21.@@ 30 , civil servants in the area of the Düsseldorf airport recognized a gang that was known to polic@@ emen from the past rob@@ ber@@ y crimes .
the two women and two men had committed several crimes since the middle of July and participated in a community , division , and especially professional .
the specialists of the Criminal Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ate 34 can demonstrate four acts to the thi@@ eves who have been travelling to Germany for off@@ ences of crimes .
in total , they captured a total of more than 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , a few lines of lime trees , a rest of the cob@@ ble@@ stone streets in between : the Riga Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichs@@ hain doesn &apos;t seem like that at first sight , but the police counts them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one goes along the road from the east to the west , one passes the play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a beer shop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ugly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
opposite of a Li@@ dl , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built until 2017 .
articles about this trendy neighborhood , as mentioned by the responsible real estate company Friedrichs@@ hain , are , however , preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars .
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rented apartments , but on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
especially since the beginning of the year , the Berlin inner sen@@ ator H@@ enkel has repeatedly called for a hard action by the police against the project , called the area as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on June 22 , the rooms on the ground floor , the Cad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , were evacu@@ ated with 300 police officers , pat@@ rolling the police three weeks &apos; official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team wag@@ ons on site , blocked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 .
at the same time , the building workers were commissioned by the unknown owner of the house .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later the police and construction workers with@@ drew under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon , the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain themselves vor@@ m late .
a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens are located in the immediate vicinity of the building projects .
left @-@ wing violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who raises three children here , are mostly irrit@@ ated by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the building projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who wished for majority police protection from the v@@ and@@ alism on the left .
the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin inner sen@@ ator and the police arise between house occup@@ ants and their neighbors , apparently does not exist .
Friedrichs@@ hain in East Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class neighborhood which , compared with the rest of the city , has a low average income and a high risk of poverty .
also house occup@@ ations and the resulting residential projects have long been part of the Kie@@ z : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Street very close to Riga .
while the Main@@ zer was evacu@@ ated under a large police force in a real street battle , many of the projects in Riga were leg@@ alized and partly occupied by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the city district has become a magnet for tourists and poll@@ ing liners of all over the world in recent years . residents of GDR times and former Haus@@ staff@@ ers now share their Kie@@ z with them .
this is also reflected in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are attacked as symbols for this development : they can be seen on raised pan@@ es or freshly painted faç@@ ades that have been thrown out with color bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year as often together with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ wing force &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes like body injury are according to statistics almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the crimes make property damages , which tend to meet the new@@ builds and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house for 17 years next to the disputed 94 , there can be no talk of in@@ security .
as far as violence is concerned , it is more important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who were certainly not .
the famous burning cars will no longer give it to Riga anymore .
for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drawn into the Riga road - and remained .
that is why it was so important to her that the local people get their way back : from the police , politics and the media , who in July all suddenly claimed the significance of the city district .
however , in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : through fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former buildings that are displac@@ ing the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are ultimately con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - rather people who are not so well drunk , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely cannot appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what can you do if you never listen to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for people who stum@@ ble over paint bombs : the house projects and the left @-@ hand scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
those who come here should be aware of this - just like someone who goes into a pub quarter , can complain badly about noise there .
all persons presented with the first name have asked not to be named with their correct name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the new Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on the spot .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee advisor for Ur@@ bach .
the social educ@@ ator supports the team of the Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger administration .
she sees herself as a contact partner for all the actors : refugees , working group refugee aid , administration , authorities and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s client of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the lu@@ cr@@ ative wool mil@@ k@@ sack , which above all has a problem .
in this way , some - less mo@@ ck@@ ering than on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job out .
we were looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work .
but administrative work is not its central area , &quot; Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le writes .
above all , it is about organizing , working with people on site and behind the scenes as well as networking activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position on three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems .
soon there are new containers in the Was@@ en@@ straße
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the municipalities are responsible for the connection provision .
you have to place the refugees in their own or hired rooms .
the cost of the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the local authorities themselves .
the respon@@ s@@ ability changes from the District Council to the municipality and the job center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
de facto , the administration does not find private homes .
so far it is not working , so that one relies on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , communal dwell@@ ings must be er@@ ron@@ ed as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be placed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine Customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent residence , there are intern@@ ships , training centers , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and employment activities for refugees and migrants who need to be rounded or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine Client .
many work in the building yard or help home@@ owners , do charitable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no occupational therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not mean only work .
the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people should develop a sense of belonging .
so I need special offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so also here administration and volunteers are jumping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they have to explain to the refugees that it just takes time and they can overcome the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses .
anyone at some point develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , don &apos;t work , and be useless , he will never integrate himself .
the clear majority is motivated .
but there are problem cases also , says customer honestly , &quot; people who do nothing at all . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : do they have fear of ra@@ dic@@ alization after the most recent events , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine says clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some nai@@ vely might call &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these incidents are also subject to refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins would bring them up completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client . &quot; &quot; &quot;
