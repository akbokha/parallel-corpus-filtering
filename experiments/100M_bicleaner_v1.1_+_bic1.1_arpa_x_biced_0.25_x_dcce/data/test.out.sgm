<seg id="1">Clinton and Trump Economic Policy in a Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing the trade agreement TTP - this is what Clinton and Trump want.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "however, the two US presidential candidates are in favour of fiscal and energy policies as well as a fundamental issue." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">The difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">That, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep the doubts rather small and cautions how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulators.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to regulate it to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, asserts Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will massively retract regulators, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "Clinton on the other hand says:" "" "the state has to fulfil certain tasks, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and needs money for it." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes for the rich would increase, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the future, we need to invest, say Trump and Clinton almost verbatim.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "the democratic candidate has even announced the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Government investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teachy wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there could be party internal discussions on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive coal mining in the US again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas; it wants to terminate the Paris climate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton on the other hand wants to explicitly expand renewable energies with its investment programme:" "" "a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpacific agreement, both do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "at the same time, both of them do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply want to protect American jobs better." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Baker & McKenzie Firm of the Year for Banking and Finance</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 was a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be rushed, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "on one hand, Trump wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics contend him so that the budget deficit would only be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least from the rich, wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Russia and Turkey: an" "" "alliance of outsiders" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight month-long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterparts in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg palace, I cannot deny myself the impression that Ankara will most want this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smiles seemed narrowly and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan on the other hand spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report all five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but can even be improved.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved as if there had never been anything worse.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed to show the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had not forgotten anything.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his introductory remarks: the downfall of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was angry.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater, as it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building the cousins again becomes difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months the state controlled media launched a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The most serious accusations were the allegations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family had profited from illegal oil trade in Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin was apologized by President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could make a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of a truce stand clear on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is first of all needed all the friends he can get after having been dismissed last month in a failed coup d "état of almost his amnesty.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - notably the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television projected cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious on the West as it regards its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">In addition, the ongoing resentment on the slug pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is keen to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian head of state won with certainty that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this splendid palace at the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to portray an "alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel alienated from the West and feel ill-treated and now unite.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played its role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they didn't even grasp the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey purposefully refrained from answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster, when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State are talking at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin fired Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV has been a part of Putin's narrowest confidence in many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed UN Special Representative for the Environment and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin it is that without giving reasons, Putin ordered" "" "the dismissal of Ivanovs from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been a proxy since 2012, has been appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated at the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGKIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it says (in Russian) that he was later a protocol leader and chief of staff of the government staff.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin on his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the government's most important task to support your activity as head of state regarding bills of bills and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was, for a long time, one of the closest confidences of Vladimir Putin and works as he for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, broadcast on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff retires at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smiles for the cameras, only a few are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who was once praised as a potential president, at one time would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, this very complicated post - you could almost say - to entrust objectionable posts for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV adopted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of five people he trusted the most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that after Putin's second term of office, Ivanov could become President of Russia, as a third term of Putin had violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another ally close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the northern deck of Queensferry crossings to the Viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closures of the" "" "ceiling blower" "", "approaching completion for each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 helical ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister Keith Brown now visited the construction site a visit today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said:" "" "this is a historic and symbolic moment in building the Queensferry crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the total deck level is at its place and the last section of the deck is now getting a final shot for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "the first fastener represents a significant milestone in each bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">In this fantastic project, the closure is a forward-looking construction and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower on the north tower, we had to close the still existing gap on the north or the north side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive as the Viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs approx. 6.000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx. 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate as the tolerances, on which the team worked, were tiny - on each side they only entered a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a chase for health and happiness that is worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenage and child are no longer going outside, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring on screens, has been mourned by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">With Pokemon Go it's about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to TV, then to video games and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many phenomenons of pop culture, interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined slightly early in July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and once they were found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the train and jumped for the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the "average" person puts back every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, who pursues 35,000 users, recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of follow-up people who train every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it merely looks the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns on the health that people want" "" "to take 30 minutes" "", "" "" "coming from the sofa" "" "and" "" "active every day" "" "came on deaf ears because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look poor." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Anyone driving sports regularly reduces its chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As usual, there are also gruelling worms that always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "it has made a breakthrough." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will fade with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to poker success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="12">The American women Simone Biles turnt on the Swedish beam during the single multi-campaign engagement of women in the gymnastics at the Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-battle champion and, in all, the fifth, while consolidating their reputation, the best of their generation or even at all.</seg>

<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:</seg>

<seg id="17">It was expected to be a final exam in Brazil, a competition which did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered as disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Americans Simone Bales, left, and Aly Raisman huddled themselves after winning gold and silver in the single multi-campaign of women in the gymnastics tournament in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while at the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi served as exclamation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on not having planned the future during their long journey, it is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - which include their typical Tumbling Pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>

<seg id="25">Since summer 2013, she has not lost any competition competition, a winning streak that will last as long as it wishes.</seg>

<seg id="28">She again picked up again with 15,433 on the bridal beam - and placed another on the floor with a 15,933 on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her gently as she expected her grandson - pure formality - and tears flowed bright red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I propose to myself under the women's Olympic team in the gymnastics hall and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I've been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Bales, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew is and Madison Kocian, who is Catholicine, rounds off, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified black and Hispanic male presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one female female female is an African-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion in Simone Bales, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected, but masterly Gymass routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American, who won gold at an individual majority event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are experiencing the peak of this sport, but we don't look like gymnastic classes across the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie beat all the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "", "because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics are an expensive sport and Turner is primarily in private sports clubs that are maintained by parents who pay for training, orientation, travel, competition and hotel costs (for coaches and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnastics are located in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these societies, the Turner receive their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Bales, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, trained both her athletes since they started gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to inspire the communities aun innumerable, young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easily accessible gymnastics training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnasium of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events we have offered free and affordable hubs in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer youth high-quality gymnastics who deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team, bringing thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by the Holen of the Olympian team of team and thanks, you motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">Thousands of heart disease patients will benefit from a £2-per day drug, after it was recommended by the authorities to administer this more people for a longer period of time.</seg>
<seg id="3">The anticoagulating medicament Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.</seg>

<seg id="6">The NICE Regulations Committee has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the arteries that form plaque.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the layer breaks apart, it can cause blood clots that cite blood flow to the heart and thereby cause a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the blood clots dissolve, it can flow through the blood stream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">Individuals who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name of Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots improbable.</seg>
<seg id="13">The draft of NICE, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE health technology evaluation center said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.</seg>
<seg id="16">The experience shows that in combination with aspirin, Ticagrelor is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Due to a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller subdued his immune system and rapprochement of a serious test by leveraging some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk cheered his train on a euro note, a handrail at Piccadilly Circus, a slip-on toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before blanching each object, he used a Luminometer to show himself what he will get involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "but the experiment that was filmed under the title" "" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" "" "brought some surprising results to daylight." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought to lick the push of a pull toilet, which has been used by thousands of others, may be totally repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright talked with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left what he licked, more than a bad taste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his bowels by travelling through the world and eating odd and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railings to railway stations to dishwashing pans of toilets, the task has definitely put its immune system under a test</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he said:" "" "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial screed showed a luminometer number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the Luminometer number of fresh washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick after her luminous number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands were less than 60.</seg>

<seg id="20">I'm not going to dock here, because it's disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products validation.</seg>

<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "Tom Hakala, who led the film, added:" "" "let me tell you this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I had instructed him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the movie." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria, in particular with the well being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left her social home after a delogiation of £50,000 because she terrorized her neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltrash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">When they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable state.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls had holes, wood floors were torn up, rubbish was dispersed on the floor and graffiti was plastered to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for house management at Cornwall Housing, said she fears that the apartment is no longer repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider, as this property is probably considered to be a not so beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said the terror that the family had inflicted on street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive screaming, strife and flight.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for anti-social behavior in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house, which may be torn down under certain circumstances, old rubbish was found</seg>
<seg id="14">In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, wooden floorboards were torn up</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they were fighting on the street and had to call the police on a regular basis.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing administered them and their partners by force this week by force, after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have failed to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house to which the police was called at regular intervals, 20 years long</seg>
<seg id="26">Litter and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown side of the community house</seg>

<seg id="28">That was a very difficult case, because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be horrible.</seg>

<seg id="30">"" "" "" "I hope this development will provide comfort to some neighbours and the message is conveyed that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated." ""</seg>

<seg id="33">Workers in the house administration will now have to evacuate garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>

<seg id="2">The IOC aims to set up a disciplinary committee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kenya's athletes are threatened after the second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a trainer home.</seg>
<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee decided to immediately set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">A Kenyan officials told us that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, delivered a urine test in the Olympic village under the name of the 800-meter-runner Ferguson Red.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by doping controllers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The World Association IAAF has requested IOC for information on the case in order to exert its own investigations, an IAAF speaker distributed.</seg>
<seg id="9">"depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures taken by the IOC, the IAAF will make an assessment," said the IAAF.</seg>
<seg id="10">"he (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and presented himself as Ferguson Red, the sample delivered and signed," said Kenias Chef de Mission Stephan Arap Soi.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ferguson Roti had become World Cup fourth in Beijing in 2015 more than 800 meters.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four days earlier, the Kenyan athlete, Michael Roti, was withdrawn from the Rio Games.</seg>
<seg id="14">He is said to have informed about pending doping tests against money payments from his country.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to media reports, he was reported to have been arrested at his return to Nairobi airport.</seg>
<seg id="16">Kenya is already under special observation at the IOC after numerous doping trials.</seg>
<seg id="17">During the announcement of the IOC launched more than 2000 doping targets in front of the Rio Games, it was unusually pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted.</seg>
<seg id="18">The World Anti-doping agency had exercised a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics beginning.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a result, WADA has taken Kenya from the list of countries whose doping control is conform to the rules of the WADA.</seg>
<seg id="21">Kenya is regarded as a great runner nation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The athletes of the country won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a series of television reports on the ARD, reproaches have repeatedly been raised that in Kenya doping funds are easily accessible and there should be a considerable mentality of sports fraud.</seg>
<seg id="24">Member of the IOC, Richard Pound, recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had employed in the Russian athletics industry.</seg>
<seg id="25">It has been demonstrated that in this sport, it became widespread and systematically curbed.</seg>
<seg id="26">Russia's athletes were subsequently expelled from the summer games.</seg>

<seg id="5">For more stupid than to date it is not possible: summer holidays, heat and land elections - this is biting.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be convinced by the electoral champions, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationers in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not natives, so don't be allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers, the posters hanging up, inflating balloons, distributing flyers and counting on the end are just laborious.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the electoral and final day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign almost to the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if one can say it at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how badly newbie afe cuts and what remains at the end of the coalition agreement.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost unobtrusive election campaign, one can see from his large posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, distributes roses and chatting a bit with the people, just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff also did.</seg>

<seg id="18">The CDU with its chief candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is, if at the wrong time, at the right place, election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major talks; Merkel federal election district lies in the north-east.</seg>

<seg id="23">Apart from that, the Nordost-CDU renounces the usual campaign conditions at market places and in front of shopping malls with parasols and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "this, like coconut, plays only a" "" "minor role." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union also noted that in the country you have to rob the base that it must be very strict to find a link to the people again.</seg>

<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD into a particularly committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys, the Socialists and Democrats were last 22 per cent behind partner CDU (25) and just just ahead of the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the 2011 election, the SPD won a clear victory at 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the surveys, should make the leap into the parliament.</seg>

<seg id="8">The same applies to those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of expedients.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site was migrated to the south on Monday and the closure of Aspergstraße in Ofandingen has been lifted and thus also the connection to Rottenburg gives rise, the traffic situation within the town has eased.</seg>

<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, however, it has become calmer.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg, the road is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Businessmen don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that the B 27 refurbishment has led to revenue shortfalls in them leaves anyone you ask.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>

<seg id="26">The most heavily exploited are the local spots along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "not only him, but all the inns have" "" "hit hard" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="34">"" "" "" "half of his employees have to be dismissed." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, Regierungspräsident Jörg Schmidt responded to a request by Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation, with the hint that the restaurant would benefit from the advantages of the location at the B 27.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows about other rural districts where such generosity has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">In all cases, Göhner is sure his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, family business has been settled here since 1715, it refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regular guests now look less frequently due to the complicated traffic guidance, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't drive, it is also somewhere else nice.</seg>
<seg id="42">However, Göhner has no doubts that his pedigree bill comes back to the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crisis of BSE and avian flu, Göhner keeps the effects of the B 27 construction work on its customers for the biggest crisis, which has experienced its restaurant in its long-term history.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely middle-aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before committing to the commentary box, to oversee it under the pseudonym not allele's middle-aged with harsh insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much discussed resurgence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in millennials that would like to welcome the news of physical objects, but to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also no hordes by hobbysammers - it has an emotional meaning: older fleets retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But tune the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit before I stop standing, hold my hands and say something about it like: "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there still remains a handful of fantastic record specialist shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to several men in such shops and try to assess their age and mood by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I follow from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle aged men) into Reckless Records (number of data: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I already like," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), revise the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford than they appeared and again buy items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I probably was a bit too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone and add: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my truck.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets on the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pub, people who heard about the comeback and decided to buy back their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations that I have conducted, people tend to get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of the record label of a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ some of the older customers contacted the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar disc covers, from objects that call for happy rejoicing memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of emptiness or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think that it is so many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally concern yourself.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "an employee floated from a stack of records." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record don't have record players.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this point in the news report, I would probably look very worried as I planks through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Series of Directors: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came here just recently and said:" I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead Sound Plate so that I can put it on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musicwise.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say:" "" "I don't have record players." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones who are only slowly getting in.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "" "" "mop, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a blower audience when I go." ""</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts latest Synthesizer- and sexbeholter Pop instead of experimental jazz groans from the loudspeakers - is it good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but naïve psychological trauma is hard to detectable when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It tends to be strolling rather than buying a big shopping bag.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't earn much, therefore collecting plates is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "it is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is..." "" "she drives away with a dearest sigh." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I appear to bolster the jeans hot pants, I observe a group of young teen girls who are looking for a moment to group Polaroid Cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of panels of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "plate art" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is also the one that is the most for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research suggests that the results of YouGov agree, they are not considered, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers existing in reality, record shops and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security not having strolling through the record shops of Berwick Street and the sheets through records, while they steer clear of the starving glance of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who raises nothing of middle-aged men over the shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional stores and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 provisional stores where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to end drinks, sell hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be demolished because they would constitute a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which contain a fire and mobility risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also led to the fact that the temporary establishments and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals to people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of those who operate the 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely comprehensible."</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feeding people living" "" "in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the decline was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is commonly used and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170.000 people signed the petition to preserve the kids' café.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "in a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure" "" "for these children would be a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years are old." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that the number of people living in the jungle camp has risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in newcomers during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers have to adapt to the next generation speed sensor: in different federal states, among others in Hessen and Brandenburg, new flashes are being tested, which should effectively transfer the tempos.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristically working Enforcement Trailer from the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at the areas of accident, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, at highway construction sites or to refurbishing bridges with temporary speed police, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary speed limit for observance of the speed limit.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be detected over several tracks at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as access restrictions after time, lane and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the advanced state you can move the trailer according to manufacturer with each car with trailer hitch.</seg>
<seg id="10">In order that it is not simply clapped, it is lowered in the measuring mode, so that the wheels disappear in the armoured and by the way also a fireproof outer shell.</seg>
<seg id="11">Furthermore, a built-in alarm system should protect the glitter from vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since 2015, the trailer has been tested according to Vitronic's specifications in various federal states and is now also used.</seg>
<seg id="13">Also foreign authorities are flashing with the new technology: recently France has ordered 100 units, after an order of 150 copies last year.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at 7-7 Rugby ended on Thursday evening to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were hit by a result of 43-7 at the deodoro Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji distributed a master class in handling, Side-Stepping, back-up, line run and ruher strength to win Gold - her first Olympic Games of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back to them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of it, a 15-man team would have beaten Fiji in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for UK - but it will probably not - that at least one Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck: Fijis Chief trainer Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, Ryan lost every game with the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they just lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wondering and let off the attacks GBs from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if they were running in buses. the World Series winners went to the top 5-0, as Osea Kolinisau beheaded in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four more minutes playing time, Jerry Tuvi added another attack from the right-hand corner.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A raging Tackle from Mitchell halted the mount of man Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but Fiji had only stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, Veremalua played a touchdown in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new member since the re-whistle and there was still more than a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressed through further weak tacklings of the UK team and ran up to the line to make a goal.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji had been born to play the 7, while GB is still unlearned.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB led fundamental changes to the half-time and closed the fijian gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the ratios of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova was running after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left-hand corner for a 36-7, but the game was long in favor of the South Sea sulphians, whose fans sang, waving flags and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The fibriff sounded, the fijis hugged themselves and GB kicked out crushingly in the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji had defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a tight half final match from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more emoteric gold than with these games and that will mean what is called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke to the last, 220 hard pieve that go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though it was only the cheers who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was allpresent when they rowed for the second Olympic old in the two without a tax concubine, the first women in the history of British Sports who used such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolute, after all her 39.ter unbeaten work, which is also exemplary.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletins, who glide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the kind of triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who make the difference and it was none other than the coach who didn't know 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that's what they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do this, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky to start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that is the right word at all.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to get better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>

<seg id="9">Now he was retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The water-repellent association of the Veitensteingruppe, based in Kottendorf, municipality Breitbrunn, annually supports about 150,000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">Member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchlouder, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply agreements for other cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current Chairman, Breitbrunn's Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), reminded that Rupert Göller was appointed waterwart in 1985 and has been appointed managing director of the kennel association in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and they stretched from water management and maintenance work on office and organisational skills, budget planning, fees and contributions to emergency interventions on weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">She called the start-up and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, the renovation of the high tank (1999), the acquisition of a central computer control system (2004) and the rebuilding of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There has been no standstill and one has always added new innovations because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her speech, she praised Göllers trusty, reliable and correct service over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has used a lot of blood for his water-purpose association and he has lived the water-purpose association correctly as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">Just a few weeks ago, as a true practitioner, he was able to present the success concept of the Veitenstein group to reduce nitrate in front of the water forum of the Lower Franconia district.</seg>
<seg id="20">For this he received a lot of recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Aquarian Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He was the best water attendant and he was a faithful boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">From his point of view he described the well-being and the restructuring of the kennel association.</seg>
<seg id="25">But the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the rupture at the elevated tank near Kirchlouder on January 3.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">Once again the supply of Neubrunn can only be maintained, because you filled the reservoir of Pettneu with hoses.</seg>

<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>

<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring the situation has become somewhat relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, the import duties imposed on imports show effect, on the other hand the economic prospects in China have brightened.</seg>

<seg id="2">The singing accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in school choir, in Lehramt he took the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in an seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more alive, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good with her health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives," "" "says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior league." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thanks to regular meeting seniors can socialize and cultivate social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to speak and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the elderly train a deep and controlled respiration.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly request their lungs will not be able to get out of the powder as quickly as they are in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it comes to keeping the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an ideal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Working Group of Senior Citizens.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the common singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people wakes up many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, even dementia-like people are unaware of long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">When singing, the head is also required to perform a special achievement, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">To concentrate on one's own voice and to a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people who live alone are doing so not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem increases with the singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I do something for a long time, I become better and more alert about myself - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you want to try a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears there when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">If you are looking for a suitable offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior level, one can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can directly contact the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with the internet search.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Sing does the soul well and has something liberating - that is true for all ages.</seg>

<seg id="6">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, such as Schnöll.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Hua Hin, located around 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok, were initially exploded on Thursday evening in a quarter of two bombs.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Friday morning two explosives once again went up, while another person was killed by the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">Also from Phuket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">A taxi driver was injured during detonation near the seaside resort Patong.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south-eastern coast of the country another bomb exploded, which killed a city clerk.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities in a flower bed, the explosive device had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the precinct of the coast police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, there were several wounded in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast as well as in Chumphon on the south-eastern coast.</seg>
<seg id="15">One goes from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was called.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the bombings carry the same signature," said army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning before journalists.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "we assume that it is a coordinated attack." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too early to express itself to possible motives - but probably it is a matter of the deeds of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the terrorist attacks of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist revolt movement or with international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a Bangkok spokesman." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It is rather assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta were laid.</seg>
<seg id="23">In recent days, the authorities have kept secret indications of upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they have not been informed of the exact time and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police have instructed their officials throughout the country to reinforce the security of important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment areas.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but they are mostly not against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace that was used for years by Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">After the bombastic bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to follow the instructions of the Thai safety authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhtsa as well as Preah Vihear and its surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="30">After confrontations between the security forces and the Muslim populations, there will be no unnecessary journeys in these provinces.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased safety risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution elaborated by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military a great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta Chef and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create mayhem while the country is heading towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military junta, which took power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, will now benefit itself to restore the kingdom to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military has not succeeded in getting a grip on the rebellious rebellion of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people were killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Just a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest plot of the recent history of the country.</seg>

<seg id="10">The Ethiopian received a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries more famous.</seg>

<seg id="1">Starting October 1, 2016, the charges per cubic meter of waste water amount to 2.10 euros for the sewage system Neudorf / Reuth / Welshahl, 3.36 Euro (until now 2.26 Euro) and for Azendorf €3.64 (until now 2.18 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a rough calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when approving the budget by the Landratsamt "Kulmbach" (Landratsamt) Kulmbach was established, undercover for these sewage systems.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal foundations, the market in Kasendorf is obliged to operate the facilities at a cost-effective manner.</seg>
<seg id="6">From October 1, 2016, the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Welshahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the wallet.</seg>
<seg id="7">The increase in fees is between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Board Manager Herbert Schmidt displayed the Board, a new calculation of charges for the waste water systems of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- and undercover from the previous calculation period will also be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">The serious fees raised Schmidt thus explained that all three wastewater facilities were relatively small facilities with a very low waste of waste water, which was between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Due to the small distribution base, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the amount of wastewater generated in all three systems is slightly decreasing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in the recuperation period for all three plants, not least due to their age of rehabilitation and repair expenditure, they have fallen to a considerable extent.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welshahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt asserted that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the wastewater treatment plant in Azendorf.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pumping station Welshahl, the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up and after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage treatment had to be extended, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation possibility to be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "Schmidt:" "" "to these extraordinary expenses, the continued assistance and maintenance costs that have to be taken into account in the new calculation period came into consideration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were clearly below the current level in previous calculations in 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "stone houses made it clear that in the case of low waste water waste in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance" "" "are" "" "fully transparent" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Snapchat" "" "Anime" "" "effect as an Asian caricature criticised" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its Filtertool Snapchat enables about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that already borders the absurde.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be a painting of Roy Lichtenstein.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are blunt, self-propelled tools that generate more than 30 million selfies a day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All miscarriages reach the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the past Snapchat filters have critiqued criticism in which they were accused of promoting the App Black face promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week suggested some users a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - "Yellow face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked themselves whether these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat informed that it would have disabled the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders, who have experienced racism, reminded the filter of hurtful clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others declined the anime-comparison decisively.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American student of art, whose tweet about the photos were widely used to make the filter "vulnerable and the least unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-sighted, but that the yellow face has been moved into the sliding extremity.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company to cross this cultural stumbling block.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And snapchats big audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older opponents - could assume more of their sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchats "filters creates a picture that is insulting for a user," it is much more difficult that such things stay unnoticed than it was before, "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who works as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium to delete their Snapchat account, asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay on medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the modeling practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable in order to say what to do about it."</seg>

<seg id="1">Military leadership distorted ISIS secret service information, establishes board of Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command altered intelligence information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as the actual conditions on the ground were allowed, an investigation committee of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The provisional report, created by a Task Force of Republican members of the Republican Committee, Intelligence Committee and the Armed Forces Commites, reports of great discontent under Central Command Intelligence Andialysts, who reported how superiors changed their assessments of the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, briefly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence, typically superseded by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly recorded a positive image of American efforts against terrorism when the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article cited the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," asked Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct indication that government tops have given orders under Obama to change the reports, it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their superiors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015 many Central Command, press releases, statements and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than it corresponds to the facts," "" "noted the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could commence in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, so much is clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the Central Command's leaders changed the intelligence reports to downplay the danger posed by ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be supplemented by more detailed insights, while the investigations will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations in the Centcom report are underway by the Ministry of Defense's general inspector.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the Republican Task Force's conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the highest ranking democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process," "" "Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "compensated the moral among analysts and" "" "gave excessive space for dissenting opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of the White House intervening with the Centcom analyst regarding a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the proceedings of the Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon's general inspector, who were contacted by CentCom analyst complaints.</seg>
<seg id="24">Mr. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congress, while the investigations of the general inspector are still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the ministry of defence greet a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being done by a growing number of members of the Department of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">The accusations of the past year however raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information on the Islamic State is reminiscent of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, foresaw only a small occupation force in Iraq and did not pretend to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker announced that contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This recognition, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">CentCom Commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the Legislative Assembly for its overly positive assessment of the situation during a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="1">The United States wins fourth match in the field hockey of women, a showdown with the UK is pending.</seg>
<seg id="2">One day after firing three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American fieldhockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember that ever.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their doors in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">The American women are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are also in their group with the Britons at the first place, which after their 2-0 victory against Japan remain unbeaten.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two will win the first and second place within their group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will take the strong Dutch a little longer out of the way the other group will lead.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game may go out on Saturday, the American women have triggered a surprising vortex through their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time she had a hockey player in her hands (her two older sisters played sports at Drexel University), at 16 years she became a national player in the United States, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008, because she couldn't qualify for the Kader.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which for her and her team everything went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the national team and thus began to turn things better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," "" "said Bam." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the workspace in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have completely rocked the rudder.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the doors in the first half of the game with a draw from the local area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She completed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the center and leaped the ball to the gate to give the American women a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the U.S. gate keeper, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position" said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the middle of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro's events feel constantly and inescapable, a fast relay race between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod that is passed from wristwatch to swimmers to turn to a triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Bales, Katie Ledecky or the controversy between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a swarm of women with dimples, could certainly have been among the well-known names sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he was a swimmer, gymnast or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted: pigeon shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-swimming and may it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should make modest arguments for my particular favourite, let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampolines have been an Olympic event since 2000, when it was in Sydney, the last 16 years have been so scary that many of them I had questioned did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal on the trampoline and until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their Gold Medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The jumping on the trampoline has some kind of outsider-charm, partly because it sounds more appropriate for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschool than that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a dented enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never-ending impact - but also the grazing of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that are essentially united.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El rebounder, meaning" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Aspiring winner jumping on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and must shoot a number of falling movements (turning, pike and salons) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "according to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed according to the design, degree of difficulty and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallions have to go further, faster, up and down in their quest for gold, sometimes down to the finish, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and down, upwards and downwards on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but also another highlight in television transmission: that of the world or the Olympic-record.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purposeful effort is posh, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to stir even one viewer to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I consider to be somewhat tiring when looking at these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a contest here, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is so Zen like the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The women's qualification and final rounds will be held on Friday afternoon, at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 1 pm.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final hours as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympics-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the fear and objectivity of male athletes - as the male US Turner recently proposed, according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley awaits his new fan community.</seg>

<seg id="4">Witnesses testify that dozens of protesters were killed during clashes with the police at shot changes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just collapsing?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people streamed into the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organizations, the government's response was ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that policemen shot and killed ninety-armed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">The videos circulating around the protests, probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Agency is now calling for a detailed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the director of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa in Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorist hazards beyond the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">His infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital of Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been curtailed, wherein dissidents have been effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the vastness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you oppress people and have no other options other than protesting, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to stranglehold regarding power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions continue along the border with Eritrea; a struggle for this shaky, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, who were more or less forced over the last few years, could use turmoil and arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness explode after years of going down under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was only in recent years that many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, as cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more common and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians sent that they were gathered together.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, the two biggest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia mainly Christian high-lands, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are here to coordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which constitute about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was in Ethiopia's prime minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in recognizing early signs of discontent and using special officers to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen from relatively obscure reasons in order to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had experienced such an upheaval in 2005, after thousands of elections protested, which, according to data from analysts, apparently were plagued by the government and then stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raids many protesters were killed, even if it was less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in fighting poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal displeasure of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters in Gondar, an amharan city, attacked by Tigray, and the hatred towards the Tigray becomes more and more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the US and other Western allies bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for Dronenic flights over the neighboring Somalia, even if it recently announced that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump asserts his claim that ISIS was founded "sarcasm."</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by angining that his repeated allegation, President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification posed new questions on the communication skills of the Republican candidate, whether he is able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his comrades who seek to protect him during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position of declaring statements that he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After making the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump came back with regards to the statement on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to indicate that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning dew on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation was completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to mitigate the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism falls down to Mr. Trump while trying to focus his campaign because of falling demand values on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried again to return to this subject.</seg>
<seg id="12">Talking about Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump already presented sarcasm to his defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he criticised himself when he thought that the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained, "Of course, I thought of sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic borders in politics and then to rue as required.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his ways to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, how they arrive, and then" clarify "depending on how the reaction drops out." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump assumed an even more corrosive tone, as his survey values continued to decline.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, which was published on Friday, showed a leading lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his provocative statements, he frequently accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while emphasizing the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump Scherze gave his loyalist sympathizers to the uncomfortable situation, no matter how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, had great difficulty in defending the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "Mr Giuliani asked him about the correctness of Mr. Trump's statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them hammers, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, allowed ISIS to spread by subjecting the situation in the Middle East aggressively.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the elections in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media, pretending to look around and be taken against him on any of his words.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he mocked the" "" "poor, jamming" "" "television experts trying to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats apologized about Mr. Trump's apology as a further proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönlandhai: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks mostly come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland sharks only get offspring with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland-shark swims down at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on average just 1,220 feet wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it arrives, the five meter long animal accelerates to a satanic 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">The lifestyle embossed by slowness seems to be a panacea for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" "" "Science" "" "from a Greenland-shark, who could be 392 years old." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "madness," "" "Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock commentates this life-margin, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Indeed, the evolution biologist presumed long that Greenland's hair will be stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear in the winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's hair.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow-motion shows them, when they reburied six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">This sharks nevertheless make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice-sea and look for cadavers coming from higher water-layers downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks, the fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest was 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals they analyzed with the carbon-14 method the lens core of the sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens arises before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are later no longer renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Its birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons attempts to tow large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third smallest animal, with a length of 220 centimeters, the lenticular nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons attempt, therefore it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lenticular nucleus, which results from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 centimeter long Greenland-shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record-shark with 502 centimeters might be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Grönlandhai-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length were able to assign an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood on the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland sharks with the multiplication obviously leave at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methyalems live mainly in icy waters is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland-whale, in whose bacon at the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on asparagus.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are also often very big.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal thus lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media clock after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israel's pre-election as it had claimed Arab guests according to a staff. "</seg>
<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah" left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>

<seg id="5">However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be invoked directly from the hotel room.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministrants from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna travelled to Freiburg on a four-day pilgrimage route from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Four stages were met together.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time until the next Romspilgrimage of all ministrants in a period of two years, the high-ministerial round of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations have been tested and finally decided for the Episcopal city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of mercy, with the gateway to the Freiburg cathedral, a special pilgrimage destination was offered.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis, of Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch, and the holy rooms, went on their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, Fr. Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrim Cross and divided the Pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb was driven by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Münster everserer is standing and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was started.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and written texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the minis at field crosses, chapels or churches repeatedly called Rast to sing a song from a specially composed pilgrim song.</seg>
<seg id="11">Parish halls of the local parishes were available for overnight stays.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the stages Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided tasty as well as strong dinners and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">We continued on the second day about Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The day after that, one entered the stage to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, but at the same time some 500 altimeters had to be descended and then climbed again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a common cricket at the bathroom in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning puls on the fourth pilgrimage day in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter, it went to the closing stage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">The minis were visibly facilitated and happy later in the afternoon at Freiburger Muenster and walked through the gate of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a little impulse God was given thanks.</seg>
<seg id="19">Minis by Kooperator Markus Obert was welcomed at the evening mass in Münster.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, the pilgrims were able to see the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked.</seg>

<seg id="2">Schottlands Callum Skinner's last evening in the men's team-Sprint in Velodrom in Rio for fame, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the pivotal role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made himself.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place in London despite the return of Hoys in March.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the Andriers Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a return.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw the potential in the Scots that has unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinder, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy prevailed - and Skinner prevailed in the qualification laps, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hinder fell short after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation that took place in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old winner from Glasgow said:" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for me.</seg>
<seg id="17">We have set up an Olympic board in the final round and the World Champion is defeated.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on Kenny's and Hoys side, he admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no objection of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "he said," "" "It feels like London with all the UK flags." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If that's a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in cycle power.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kenny it is in the range of possible that he won the victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">This would be for Kenny - exactly 12 years younger than Hoy who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint that starts today and is going for three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "I enjoy this only for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should become a knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the finish in 3: 51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record that won gold in London 2012 was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had contested yesterday with representatives before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will continue tomorrow and end, Laura advanced, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a band of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Drama played in the background, as the resignation of Shane Sutton's technical director in April surrounded by sex and mobbing issues as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks as if the legendary reputation GBs, which reaches its zenith at the perfect moment, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs by workers - are at stake, as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus cancels all supply contracts, as the supply energy company communicated.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the government's decision to invest in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years runs out in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2,000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk in a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects, as the melting plant uses around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa joined the Point Henry Schmelzerei, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "the" "" "melt" "" "of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks closure." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, informed that three other owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller portions.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL expects that the plant in Portland will continue to operate, which means further physical demand for electricity by melting glaciers," said the company.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL also stated that the contracts were called "hedging transactions," which should have entered into force from November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month notice period, so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "therefore AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the financial year 17," "" "said the supplier of electricity." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impact on AGL revenues as of the GJ 18 is currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL stated that the value of the contracts had already been written down in its annual subscription to the amount of $187 million in "anticipation of termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Alcoa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts, the" "" "Ability Alcoas..." "" "to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt" "" "will not be impaired." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said it had completed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang that would have entered into force from November this year even if it is still a statement of why it has resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the industry's poor economic conditions before the potential closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">Referring to the analysts "statements at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses around 600 megawatts per year to consume around 900 megawatts of electricity every year.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran to fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday news on her Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," Kendall wrote.</seg>
<seg id="5">The cover of the cover followed a bizarre (or just keeping up with the Kardashians similar?), descriptive reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular show biz-uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), which ends with a classic turn: they all planned a surprise party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is the clichés of nearly every birthday party of a child's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to somehow take part in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians began with certainty.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim may have smitten what the vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league of itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most sold out of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that resembles an illustrated book as a fashion magazine, the issue attracted a large number of advertisers (According Fashionista were 615 pages of advertising from the 832 pages of the Wälzer).</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover stars is so eagerly anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the Bulletin still transpired before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "in recent years there were clearly more" "" "celebrities that modeln" "" "as" "" "models that are celebrities" "" "on the cover." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar-Prize laureate and brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "but even with the little chance that Ms Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the" "" "breakthrough model" "" "of her generation - falls under the earlier category, she is in good company." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">Celebrities aren't related to celebrities or celebrities from today who know how to shoot a good Snapchat video (even if all of them apply to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had the release of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenners pleases success not everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With their reality TV history, Jenners's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret-Model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized them and called them "The Mists of the Moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings boiled down again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But on the face of misfortune seems to pass by at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She works for Marc Jacobs.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably inhabited according to projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether Venus could have reared with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have already pointed out that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet presumably pointed out more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to house life and protected from fast evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also profited from a sun, which was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the ISS modeling simulation the slow turn of the Venus will expose its daylight side of the sun for nearly two months," stated GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield off the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus, which resembles the evolution previously assumed by planet explorers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although initially habitable, Venus -- over the course of several billion years --exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogen just left a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="3">The new data will help the astronomers understand why stars rotate in cluster formation to different rates as well as in what context the rotation periods are associated with planetary formation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that through comparing our results with other constellations, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>

<seg id="7">They are now turning the fastest.</seg>

<seg id="2">Caught: due to a positive doping sample, weight lifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland in Rio will not start.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping attacks.</seg>
<seg id="4">A wiped athlete had won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh race day, the first official doping events have become known in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimming actress Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter steeple in Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the already critically acclaimed athletics competitions this news came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was demonstrated last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Court of Sport CAS confirmed its expulsion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butterflies, only 0.09 seconds missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen should have participated in the runs over 50 m of freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) requested an opening of the B-sample and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter" "" "very serious and demands full cooperation in the investigations," "" "said Xinhua from a message saying:" "" "we will work together with the International Criminal Court CAS and will accept the verdict." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also during the night of Rio the news spread about the positive rehearsal at Danekowa, the 33-year-old went to the offensive itself.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "said the Bulgarian TV station BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "it was innocent," "" "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," "" "said the athlete." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, the banned substance should be the blood doping agent EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova was suspended preliminary, according to BNT, the B-sample should have already had a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov immediately spoke to the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said: "we are under observation, so many have already been excluded."</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weight lifters from the chronically doping nation may not participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday, the case "Adrian Zielinski," the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg, was tested as his brother Tomasz three days earlier positive on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.</seg>
<seg id="23">They both take the ingestation, both of them are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before starting athletes, the Danekova case is another heavy blow to the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The World Federation (IAAF) banned the entire Russian team up to an exception due to systematic doping, and Kenya's Läufernos produces numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the swimming sport, the earlier tensions in China also caused fierce controversies between the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">Thus the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang pinkelt lila."</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "when I see the podium over 200 m of freestyle, I want to commit myself," "" "said Lacourt on the French Radio." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was also the focus of an engagement with the Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I have no time and no respect for doping fraud," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Sun was tested positively by the Chinese nationals in 2014 on the stimulant of Trimetazidin, but only had to sit on a three-month lock.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data-lau: so perfide presses hackers her ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting specific companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey conducted by the malware Defense specialists Malwarebio under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies reported at least once in the past twelve months, sometimes multiple victims of an attack using blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, nearly 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims readily paid the deletions required by the perpetrators to recover the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential for redeeming ransom is significantly higher than for private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebio chief Marcin Kleczynski talking to the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the malware programs were designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to company attaches was frightening quickly over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware operates according to a simple pattern: once activated on a victim's computer, it searches for unmodified files such as Word-, Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently the software presents the receivables of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final turn code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users have the personal photo database on the game, companies are interested in sensitive customer data or project databases without the production being shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware hits.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 per cent of affected German companies reported revenue losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt the operation, in one case, people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany several hospitals were already victims of attacks, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only have the problem," "" "says Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay will get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of downtime in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hacker in turn know this and try everything to build up a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the security researchers of F-Secure explored the user interfaces and contact with the blackmail users and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims using chat on how they can pay per Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt example files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And when individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euro, companies must deal with hard bargain and pay five-figure sums to return their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more and more professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a ransomware around within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that these are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software module to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The existing malware kits have been created by purchasing the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a one-time fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of supply includes a adjustment tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be altered," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailers are then looking for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">Thus, one logs in one of the forums on the underground, buys the set of a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment will be made per authenticated calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals then instruct spammers with the spread," Wisniewski explains.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies IT managers in the Malwarebyte survey trust that they can repel ransomware by means of file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful closure, the offenders instead threaten with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing calculations," "" "explains Malwarebio chief Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that, depending on the type of data, the potential for damage is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators could also completely new targets on the internet of things in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the hacker conference Defcon, safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter the activation of such a blocked heater may well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, turns out to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the HR-V is only 1.60 m high, the passengers have plenty of space in the first row and in the rear, it does not work narrowly at any point.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant, only the cockpit upper side falls off there.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage space.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "it is not only a boot of 453 l with raised and 1026 l backrests, but there is the" "" "Magic Seats" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical when it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a seat and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the ground to the ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk can be loaded easily, but the loading height is a little higher at 650 mm compared to the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he should make his work a bit quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine: a 1.5-litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">But steering is likely to be a bit more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "the equipment in the tested top variant" "" "Executive" "" "leaves nothing to be desired." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The safety systems include the City emergency braking system (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "the collision warning sometimes irritates because it assesses many obstacles as" "" "approaching objects" "" "when manoeuvring." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The high-beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent template responds to the traffic sign recognition and throttles the speed when needed.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the full connectivity is only available for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and one HDMI connector lie under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, one rolls around eternally, at night one is awake for hours, in the morning it is not possible to think long before the wake-up ring.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep problems manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several types of sleep disorders, and there can be a variety of reasons for them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weaving, member of the German Society for Sleeping and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you understand for the time being, however, is the insomnia, i.e. a dormant and dormant disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is precisely the diarrhoea that many people experience as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, board member of the German Medical Association with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this, organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medicines are stuck.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is not rare that the sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is common especially in depression," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors wrestle one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, if you have a herniated disc, it can be bad, wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to ponder about everyday problems and worries, give birth to an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor, tell the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is abbeaten, tired, inescapable, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments like stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleeping disorder, it is important to find out the causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medicines - classic slaughtering tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">Dr. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary Doctoral Medical Center at the Charité University Medical Center, Berlin, hardly exists in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore one should contact the family doctor in case of sleep problems, she advises her.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can be clarified by examining whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the examination in the sleep laboratory, physicians advise, for example, in case of snoring with respiratory equipment, in case of disease fatigue, sleepwalkers, or if one does not find the cause of a dormant disorder, Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "just do not make a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After the clacking, you go to bed at the normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-pair, a chest strap and a feeler on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera shows the sleeping-ends at the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which one can sit for better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">She is counting on: regular bedtime and stand-up times, don't sleep too long in bed, don't sleep on the day, do not watch TV for sleeping, avoid alcohol and don't look at the clock at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is quite and not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="3">The arrest of two women and two men aged between the ages of 50 and 61 took place on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">The suspects had committed several handkerchiefs and luggage-steels as a gang.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 21.30, civil servants in the area of the Düsseldorf airport recognized a gang that was known to policemen from the past robbery crimes.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two women and two men had committed several crimes since the middle of July and participated in a community, division, and especially professional.</seg>
<seg id="7">The specialists of the Criminal Commissariate 34 can demonstrate four acts to the thieves who have been travelling to Germany for offences of crimes.</seg>
<seg id="8">In total, they captured a total of more than 15,000 Euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few lines of lime trees, a rest of the cobblestone streets in between: the Riga Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain doesn't seem like that at first sight, but the police counts them to the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one goes along the road from the east to the west, one passes the playgrounds, a newly painted kindergarten and a beer shop.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone" "" "ugly" "" "has sprayed on the facade of a grey house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite of a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built until 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">Articles about this trendy neighborhood, as mentioned by the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain, are, however, preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rented apartments, but on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Especially since the beginning of the year, the Berlin inner senator Henkel has repeatedly called for a hard action by the police against the project, called the area as a "no-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On June 22, the rooms on the ground floor, the Cadterschmiede, were evacuated with 300 police officers, patrolling the police three weeks' official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team wagons on site, blocked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, the building workers were commissioned by the unknown owner of the house.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal, and a day later the police and construction workers withdrew under the jubilation of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon, the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain themselves vorm late.</seg>
<seg id="12">A primary school and kindergartens are located in the immediate vicinity of the building projects.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who raises three children here, are mostly irritated by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the building projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a Kiez, who wished for majority police protection from the vandalism on the left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin inner senator and the police arise between house occupants and their neighbors, apparently does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional working-class neighborhood which, compared with the rest of the city, has a low average income and a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also house occupations and the resulting residential projects have long been part of the Kiez: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Street very close to Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was evacuated under a large police force in a real street battle, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and partly occupied by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the city district has become a magnet for tourists and polling liners of all over the world in recent years. residents of GDR times and former Hausstaffers now share their Kiez with them.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rīga are attacked as symbols for this development: they can be seen on raised panes or freshly painted façades that have been thrown out with color bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year as often together with the words" "" "left-wing force" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes like body injury are according to statistics almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the crimes make property damages, which tend to meet the newbuilds and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house for 17 years next to the disputed 94, there can be no talk of insecurity.</seg>
<seg id="27">As far as violence is concerned, it is more important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours who were certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="28">The famous burning cars will no longer give it to Riga anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Riga road - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was so important to her that the local people get their way back: from the police, politics and the media, who in July all suddenly claimed the significance of the city district.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: through faceless newbuildings in former buildings that are displacing the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are ultimately condominiums that are not interesting for many here - rather people who are not so well drunk," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I absolutely cannot approve violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what can you do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for people who stumble over paint bombs: the house projects and the left-hand scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who come here should be aware of this - just like someone who goes into a pub quarter, can complain badly about noise there.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is the new Commissioner for Refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle has been the refugee advisor for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social educator supports the team of the Achim Grockenberger administration.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact partner for all the actors: refugees, working group refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine's client of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, the lucrative wool milksack, which above all has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this way, some - less mockering than on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job out.</seg>
<seg id="9">We were looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, "Annika Deuschle writes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organizing, working with people on site and behind the scenes as well as networking activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine Client, that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time players." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there are new containers in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "a serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">You have to place the refugees in their own or hired rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsability changes from the District Council to the municipality and the job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private homes.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far it is not working, so that one relies on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, communal dwellings must be erroned as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine Customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, training centers, school grounds, one-euro jobs and employment activities for refugees and migrants who need to be rounded or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine Client.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help homeowners, do charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no occupational therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not mean only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People should develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need special offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here administration and volunteers are jumping.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have to explain to the refugees that it just takes time and they can overcome the time wisely, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Anyone at some point develop the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach, don't work, and be useless, he will never integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are problem cases also, says customer honestly, "people who do nothing at all." the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do they have fear of radicalization after the most recent events, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "Regine says clearly," "" "what some naively might call" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "these incidents are also subject to refugees." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins would bring them up completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine Client." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and honorary officials must look for activities on site and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They are always in the background that a new impetus for refugees and migrants might soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics is afraid.</seg>
<seg id="59">In fact, it is unfair to put them on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "in Urbach we haven't arrived where we want to go," "" "says Annika Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher is already working to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
