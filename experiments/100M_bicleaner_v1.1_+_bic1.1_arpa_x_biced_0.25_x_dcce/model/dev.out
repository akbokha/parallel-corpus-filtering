Obama welcomes Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , however , the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement of Israel and re@@ jects Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
by the deal promoted by Obama about Iran &apos;s nuclear program , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated .
in March , at the invitation of the Republi@@ can Repub@@ lic@@ ans , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech , which was partially regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected it with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call Professor , his girlfriend shot to have shot
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; lamb was important to stress that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house the officials found the corp@@ se of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was put on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds where he killed and killed a popular historical professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ gn@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said Lamb has made the fatal emergency call at some point .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life when the police en@@ ra@@ ged him .
one day after shooting at the university , the students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time there were some tendencies towards problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University to have an absence for health reasons , saying that he has any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would not represent a guarantee for an automatic route to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs trail later when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pi@@ sto@@ l in the back@@ yard of a house approximately a mile south of his par@@ ental home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house but Johnson said that he knew he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedago@@ gy .
he did his doctorate in the spring of pedago@@ gy .
one of the long @-@ standing friends of Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool old guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar play .
at that time , he was the s@@ warm of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls melt away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail had both appeared on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 . September last time Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica pi@@ el before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the clearing and j@@ ested with each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Fr . Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his bro@@ therhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commem@@ oration ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ wache , while the university choir &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and Ama@@ zing Grace sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that Lamb is now saying that Lamb created the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that he called Pr@@ enti@@ ss in his call Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .

Michael J. Fox swe@@ ats about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat next to me is empty and it will gradually become clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film starts and it comes to mind that I am a simulated yar@@ n and a length of it from being with the princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had a premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time travel film ever shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be available on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN CEO says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only ag@@ grav@@ ate violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN Chief Executive again ur@@ ges all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution .
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Britain and France - on the ver@@ ge of meeting the meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation impossible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ban challenged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity with Iran in tac@@ kling the crisis in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 survey values showing that Donald Tru@@ mp is taken seriously .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks at p@@ olls , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last 11 national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to wonder about what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate fashion .
of course it is too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts point out that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys leadership was handed over to the rising herds of Her@@ man Cain , of whom no one only won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have fought in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise Tru@@ mp &apos;s per@@ sever@@ ance and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
one of the most popular types of shri@@ mps has turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa last week noted that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enthusiastic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Tru@@ mp was nominated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they were &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they are &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans does not see the mistaken temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 per cent of the Irish voters tend to believe that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , says ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first pres@@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a supreme commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament didn &apos;t fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if they expose their schol@@ ar hats , Republi@@ can voters hold Tru@@ mp for real .
if they are asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a pol@@ l of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week , four out of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
this is a change since the time four out of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination compared to just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P voters think Tru@@ mp &apos;s campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp is still beating almost everybody .
some experts point out that the fragmented field will probably contribute to Tru@@ mp leadership , while the anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is distributed across more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp is re@@ aping the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of C@@ Charlie Fi@@ or@@ ina , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say they have formed their mind .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Tru@@ mp are saying that they have given their votes firmly .
of course , a lot can happen to change this , and no one can really say , never change the opinion .
46 per cent said that they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tru@@ mp is the strongest competitor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind are twice as common for Tru@@ mp .
six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ape &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immig@@ rant from Mexico two months ago , the immigration of pi@@ vot@@ al and pi@@ v@@ ot in public discourse was in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp &apos;s pi@@ vot@@ al His@@ pan@@ o Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ Survey of Monday , six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with Tru@@ mp in case of immigration issues .
so long as the immigration is left in the spotlight it will appear to be Donald Tru@@ mp .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new high@@ s .
Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son now accounts for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days pol@@ l by ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than anyone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Repub@@ lic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; fern@@ ally angry . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea .
in the street , a square meter of a roof@@ ed roof@@ ed house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special locations one square meter most cost .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student office in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top living places , however , one of the prices is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square metre prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros ni@@ x - per square meter , well @-@ known .
but well , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at its peak here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bayern @-@ Dream@@ start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double Tor@@ schüt@@ z in Pi@@ raeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller just finished .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller , the FC Bayern , paved the way to a deserved 3 : 0 with Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ re@@ aus - then it ran .
a sovereign kick @-@ off of the Champions League season .
world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have a dream start to the &quot; Milan Mission &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ raeus .
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their tournament play in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9th ) ear@@ ns with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth consecutive victory in series is supposed to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola will finally bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller received paid assistance from Olympic Stadium go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto at his 28th place in the Champions League for Bavaria leadership , who made a shot of the world champion thought of as a flan@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ame had promised hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is Stadium - and the Munich @-@ based spoken word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without shining .
Pi@@ re@@ aus had won his latest six home games in the Royal league , including prestigious clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund also stum@@ bled ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams un@@ defeated , did not want to be the next victim .
they went courage@@ ously , but often too resour@@ ceful in their offensive efforts .
the attacks were often introduced by playing shift on the left side of Douglas Costa , which rarely came through against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k hit the right half @-@ field in the top right corner of the door .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first of all , as Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ a Brown hit the Pol@@ es &apos; head ball from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct debit , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ked on his knees ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians raised their hab@@ itu@@ al dominant game , Pi@@ raeus could set needle @-@ stal@@ ks .
but Manuel Neu@@ er was abandoned .
for example , when he defle@@ cted a shot of ide@@ ye over the l@@ atin ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of Neu@@ er , guar@@ ola ordered a four @-@ leg@@ ged fellow with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training , said vice @-@ president Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to make something different from it is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the slain Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Got@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller made another one .
in front of the game , it was at sta@@ di@@ ums in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly contaminated Bayern @-@ fans were apparently prov@@ oked by the fans of host Pi@@ raeus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and attacked the Munich @-@ based followers .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
good news : the risk of ren@@ unciation decreases rapidly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this is due to the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold .
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
main causes of tooth loss are c@@ aries and inflamm@@ ations of the gin@@ gi@@ val , emphas@@ ises the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore reduced to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment falls back to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained Er@@ du@@ tor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people must convince people to become non @-@ smokers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Head of Manager H@@ einer Boeing from the DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking reduces the lifetime &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , leads to good dental health up to the high age .
in Germany more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of denti@@ stry was affected by the DI@@ f@@ E .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists come across from the Rhein@@ u@@ fer on remains from late Anti@@ quity
archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
in the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum skel@@ et@@ ons and rem@@ nants of historic buildings have excav@@ ated , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called soil monuments .
in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always added as a specialist department for arch@@ e@@ ological soil conservation .
in the third stage of the Rhine lev@@ ards , the archae@@ ologists were now five .
it was already known from text documents that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , explained Trier .
in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves , which probably belonged to the church .

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
in order to mitig@@ ate the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic trade agreement TTIP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its functioning corresponds to significantly more traditional courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained EU Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de proposes to bring the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
the TTIP aims to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely demonstrate that the EU states and the USA jointly select independent judges for a new investment court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and from third countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time , a second instance is planned .
she would allow him to appeal against jud@@ gements .
so far the proceedings concerned have agreed with each other on arbitr@@ ators , a claim for objection to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of recent months it has become clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work on an international investment court according to its own specifications .
here , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) , particularly demanded by large corporations , is considered one of the main reasons for the large opposition in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ism , on the companies making compensation of the tax@@ pa@@ yers , negotiating national laws or to enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act identified the proposals of the European Commission as insufficient .
it was critici@@ zed above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic secretary Matthias Mach@@ ined ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a major advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission considered significant points in the reform , the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked out in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration was from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against restric@@ ting the economic activities of the economy by too many new rules .
in this way , particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the talks on the TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer sustainable .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Prime Club of Cologne ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
beside him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart to which the shy true folk singer recorded the picturesque US state of Mich@@ igan with felt pencil .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he talks on the basis of various places he always records on the map , wor@@ rying about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they originated and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has turned out to be a wonderfully creative Irish .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously with American folk in the late six@@ ties , but can drift into great opul@@ ent at any time .
the rum@@ our , &quot; Mich@@ igan , &quot; would be the first part of a twisted series : each of the 50 US states should follow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and in the Rhine @-@ proximity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and has positive expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens stops here .
he gives him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician , living in New York , returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) a nationwide celebrated masterpiece is published in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bor@@ rowing ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and lacks any annual list of the influential music media .
after extremely productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then relies on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ ore &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic records .
this sixth fourth studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and rever@@ b .
long since the smaller clubs have sprung up , the stage shows are here for the colorful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is part of a five @-@ member band through Germany .
in the dark ham@@ burger More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which has been available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although almost 2,000 guests now sit in their chairs , the pla@@ in@@ ly turned St@@ ev@@ ens returns to the in@@ timacy and to the folk .
without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays through the wide @-@ enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you hear from the audience : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the talk is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abundant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can throw the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record in essence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only one en@@ core thank@@ ed St@@ ev@@ ens mo@@ dest@@ ly , plays acousti@@ cally a few older songs and finally bowed down with thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the prime minister &apos;s frac@@ tion@@ als
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut is expected with excitement at the prime minister &apos;s frac@@ tion@@ als
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n should give his debut at the prime minister &apos;s frac@@ tion@@ als and set up for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of his six pre@@ defined questions shortly after noon , and his performance is prob@@ able by the media and the Labour MPs from close quarters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fewer theatre and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader , on Tuesday during the singing of the national an@@ them during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , prov@@ oked criticism from a number of T@@ ory MPs and stands at the centre of several title pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Mr Cor@@ by@@ n spokes@@ man said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they refer to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also stack@@ ed within Labour , namely by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes forward to remove the whole idea of a limitation overall .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pension minister said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against government plans to reduce the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to 23.@@ 000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he is T@@ ory leader , over the Dis@@ patch Box in the Parliament over the last decade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader , who has promised another policy , says that he has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s frames are too confron@@ t@@ ational and that he is subject to both &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the stri@@ fe with counter@@ s and instead focusing on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said Angela Merkel , who will represent the shadow of economic ministers , if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into a conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy Theater , &quot; which is often linked to the prime minister &apos;s frames . but a few years later he admitted that he failed in it .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the prime minister considered the prime minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the ruling of a leader and his position under his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require widespread reforms .

pound increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the Po@@ und rose br@@ itt@@ y according to data , which show an increase in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the goal of SA@@ B@@ Miller .
between May and July the result was increased by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year without bonuses in the United Kingdom .
since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and educated estim@@ ation of the time of an increase in interest rates .
the Po@@ und rose by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index included an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after acquisition of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods , Ri@@ chem@@ ont , 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Ri@@ chem@@ o &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core increased by 5 % after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion dollars through a stock sale as part of its strategy of debt reduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his estim@@ ation for the rating &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ating on &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports clothing company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages threaten expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate the higher labour costs of his company , he says .
the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

not bad .
hundreds of fans attended Justi@@ n yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
in the morning , however , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone s@@ labs of the Berlin luxury hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fill her a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to pay for school ?
who is it@@ ching ?
the fans do not .
even Bi@@ eber itself is not .
he has taken care of anyway .
for the advertising in the Super@@ market &apos;s ad break he c@@ ashed three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ imp@@ le company pur@@ ged many dollars to the Bi@@ eber account .
and with every doll that looks like it and goes over the counter , Bi@@ eber is also cas@@ hier .
if Justi@@ n Bi@@ eber drinks a coffee , you will be amazed at the window pane .
he is said to have exploited more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e goes too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; others stress that Bi@@ eber is finally in the USA and Great Britain with his new single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on No. 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , are not interested in the many zer@@ os .
at least he does so .
PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster brings Lebanese to the idea of a Pot@@ ato d@@ ön@@ er idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
it is both - in the Pot@@ ato d@@ ön@@ er , who developed the Ol@@ den@@ burger snack @-@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay Pot@@ el and flesh put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he saw on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , there is a barbecue in his store , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea has now been registered at the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authorities , it has recently been protected as utility models .
so how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
Met@@ cash launches Ground Clear@@ ance Campa@@ ign to combat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ decay
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has launched a ground insur@@ gency campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in the early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand I@@ GA through mainstream marketing and marketing via the social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and store shop@@ keepers who sell dis@@ counted tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish more details of its defense strategy on September 29 when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor strategy ag .
it is much on the game since South Australia and Western Australia accounts for nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ orious provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that twelve months after the opening of its first markets , around five percent of the food market in these two countries will be cut off and all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers , will take it away .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose $ 360 million per year and met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year and generate revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and in the amounts on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ ti &apos;s high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in food and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told in a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash declined to respond publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ AS market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenue from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operational debt reduction at the same time pressure on sales and margins .
however , the wholes@@ aler def@@ ends itself and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to equal sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ vor@@ oth with hundreds of products each week and I@@ GA retailers to improve their stores with fast growing fresh foods and delivering a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and shop renovation programs will grow to El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his behaviour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ burg and , according to the President of the Australian tennis association , Steve He@@ aly deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his own behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight by the not@@ orious confrontation of Kyr@@ burg with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka .
in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , where Har@@ rison exc@@ laimed : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka should have sm@@ ashed Kyr@@ gios , and I should strike the child . &quot;
while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp@@ f twisted a potential US Open @-@ win of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in singles behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ fin@@ als against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m quite concerned about is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little into the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he has been treated a little too severely .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he goes into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take account of the important preliminary decision which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term permanent component to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Nick made very fast the climb to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he has made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , I consider appropriate , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency stand , closes the border , holds refugees back
Hungary declares the state of emergency and sm@@ iled the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to get illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Ser@@ b officials with indignation .
the people who fled from violence stuck for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations got up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the border &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and scre@@ amed insul@@ ts against the Hungarian deployment police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some returned from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister declared that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more came from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days , talks with Brussels and other countries must take place , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence at the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block in a controversial meeting in Brussels that no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would record further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes for a spe@@ edy action from Brussels or from its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency stand rested on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plan to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after it has ended a fence along the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison guards were deployed in the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck and an entry point in the European Union for many refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the upcoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who claim protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 feet ) high fence , which the government built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also impose higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency , &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament must still agree to the military use of the military scheduled for next week , but Re@@ porter of Associ@@ ated Press has already seen on the border heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities found 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country .
they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are able to quickly repair the fence .
on Tuesday morning Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train car with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process people &apos;s data and press a crowd to push themselves there .
about 20 managed to arrive , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l hal@@ ved
the former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to the ground .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euro@@ monitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidate for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters in the elections .
more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders scored some gains .
Clinton has a major lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
their support for the men has decreased significantly , and S@@ anders is only 5 points behind .
Clinton &apos;s advantage for democratic voters under 50 years has evap@@ or@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
but Clinton has a major advantage over the older voters .
last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the democratic voters in the country &apos;s elections say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support it with some reservations and further 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
maybe it &apos;s not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are enthusiastic about her .
the views are stronger with those who are currently not supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusi@@ astically .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that it &apos;s time for a woman president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection to Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permission to deal with the problems and the eligi@@ bility are also cited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the vice president throws a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if democratic voters of the elections are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters say more than half that Bi@@ den would be far ahead of her second choice .
if Bi@@ den does not advocate the nom@@ ination of the demo@@ crats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of S@@ anders increases , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has dropped by 78 percent in the last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bi@@ ds is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call for questions about the elec@@ torate .
similarly , as in the last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for this vot@@ er of the elections is unacceptable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results in some important traits when voters elect their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider maj@@ orities as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
for the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty per cent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe it .
democratic voters in the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters has no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term of office as Minister of Foreign Affairs continue to be placed , most Democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions overall .
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their declaration , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the email controversy had no effect on their general opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion had deterior@@ ated from it .
they are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse .
although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 per cent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of the voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 per cent of the bene@@ fici@@ aries nationwide see Tru@@ mp as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
however , Clinton and Tru@@ mp will receive good management notes .
from the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best cut off at hon@@ esty .
a majority sees S@@ anders rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son draws near Donald Tru@@ mp in a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is closely behind Donald Tru@@ mp in the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the two candidates meanwhile half of the support of voters in the new survey , and others lose dramatically . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in large numbers nationwide . support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey carried out before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , 27 % in the Tuesday survey .
but Car@@ son fell from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also concluded that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and tru@@ mp is sur@@ passed among Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ Charlie Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen on the deepest , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
the former governor of Florida , J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are at 6 % in third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons by Repub@@ lic@@ ans in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son enters the p@@ olls - he lands with 19 % support among the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp a lot ahead of Car@@ son .
with a view of a car@@ son rising in the last week , Tru@@ mp found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon himself , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed for asking Tru@@ mp &apos;s faith .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa .
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , there is already a trip to the Mediterranean for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find hot water .
a bath in the north or the Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people don &apos;t go into the sea anymore : at a maximum of 18 degrees the water in the North and Baltic Sea has this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares with .
on the other hand , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , there are 25 degrees in the top , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood loaded with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
almost two years after a student died during a hi@@ ring ritual of a student association in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges against five persons are submitted .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ bro@@ therhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introductory ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , shared the police .
officials said he had been charged with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i Delta P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was impot@@ ent and supposedly waiting for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to switch to D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to collect advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils , and basically set the fr@@ at@@ ernity of the Brotherhood over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ gn@@ ef Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g was repeatedly added with mu@@ te force injuries to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ anes of the Brotherhood . at least one student died on the ch@@ ic@@ ans every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment due to murder of the third Gra@@ des for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous attacks and education of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold this accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an increase in interest is coming , and the far@@ es are shaking , ren@@ der@@ ings for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into a recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will last and how long it will last .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only minor guidance on the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted for 86 months .
the aggres@@ siveness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react .
therefore representatives of the U.S. Central Bank strongly stressed that investors should not focus when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
however , in the end market participants could find that the whole excitement possibly was exagger@@ ated because of an increase in interest .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still on a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no effects .
here is a look at historic trends based on how some areas of the economy might react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets will be accounted for 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market has been in the last 35 years mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest increase , fairly flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal conditions after 500 days , with an average return in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , which published Bob Dol@@ l , chief plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks tends to occur later in the increases cycle and the return on investment will begin to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a rate increase of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , 118 interest rates since 1950 was only twice nominal GDP under 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.@@ 6 percent , few expect this to continue and anticipate only 1.5 percent for the third quarter following the indications of Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have made an increase of the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trading yields only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all elev@@ ations from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ary heights were put into the shadow very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months until now .
firm income was also volati@@ le as the market anticip@@ ates interest increase , and the pattern is rather similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that bonds are faster than in shares if they change their strategic course .
in bonds , the returns seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the ascent cycle , the bond yields fell immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will cause returns between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often result in better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jones thinks that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , bor@@ rowing has expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all features of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens their strategy .
in large and medium @-@ sized businesses , companies that handle the greater part of their business operations in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt will be po@@ orer , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial increase in interest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts become a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most , said Gold@@ man .
outside the pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see profits by higher yields , even if experts from different opinions are how quickly this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Parliament member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the channel because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; condem@@ nation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also went to the BBC Music Awards and said that they only mim@@ i@@ ded The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked the broadcast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; into Classic FM , claiming a leading member of the Parliament and raises new pressure on the radio station to prove that he does something that the private sen@@ ders do not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also told the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the publicly @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from his commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also went to the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be only under a different name .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC Director General rejected the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I &apos;m learning from Radio 3 , I &apos;m going to learn from classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the engagement of Radio 3 , to find new music and to give new works on behalf , I really consider important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder should be done to engage the audience when it was in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sport for the purpose of stepping on the commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Richter - was produced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in special BBC mode &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wants the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the next time it is a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other rows of The Voice in the future or to give money to the fee pa@@ yers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales rose to slow@@ est in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the record was recorded in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed the expenses
for over a decade , virtual shopping has dri@@ lled , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
experts say there are signs that online sales are stagn@@ ating after new figures only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with just five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts predict that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always been developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that is sw@@ inging , and we may experience that growth is dimin@@ ishing .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the subsequent sales .
experts believe that buyers will keep their purchases prior to this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers hit their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 was spent more than £ 1 online for £ 5 .
in some products such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , more than one third of the shopping is now being carried out via web @-@ shops .
at the same time more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried the killed in Mec@@ ca during the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the corp@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funeral par@@ ables in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia partly cr@@ ushes the collapse of the huge Saudi bin Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane crashed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the killed who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed to Mek@@ ka &apos;s grandfather .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the way to pay their respect when the first of the dead approached their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance ch@@ urch@@ yard .
the procession passed on to the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the bed .
the bodies were approved for burial , when the Saudi king made a san@@ ction on the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the catastrophe , which also left 3@@ 94 injured .
the corp@@ ses of 29 worshi@@ ppers who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Bank of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane crashed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ h in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officers have already stated that the p@@ add@@ h will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city .
today , King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden group allegedly did not have the arm of the crane , when he was not used .
an Arab version of the decree issued by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group is responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad was prohibited .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man was able to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which pl@@ ung@@ ed into a courtyard of the large mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the H@@ add@@ h , who later took place this month , gathered together .
the Bin Laden Group has not issued statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .

dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project headed by the bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .

B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European crafts@@ man is over
British increasingly occupied craftsmen , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe has a rise in
this means that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops targeting professional tra@@ des@@ people will be opened .
at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets across the country
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chief Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Br@@ its disman@@ tle their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified East European craftsmen who carry out the work in their homes
if you are skill@@ ful to deal with a hammer or brush for painting walls , you seem to belong to a minority nowadays .
the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to carry out DIY jobs in their homes , such as the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the building markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe that offer services at low prices has now out@@ dated .
therefore , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops to address professionals and close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten buying decisions in the store are met by women .
at the moment , the men predomin@@ ate with the employees .
she said it is necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households with more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our branches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this towards a balance more strongly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a UK in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the shops .
because of the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian Volleyball Vi@@ zem@@ ei@@ ster A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of office .
from this accus@@ ation he was acqu@@ itted in force in May .
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary examination , the defend@@ ants had crystall@@ ised that in 2006 to 2011 , the defend@@ ants used mon@@ ies from the accounts that they were allowed to dispose of in their functions for private purposes .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
sports officials are also accused of financial mel@@ ts .
this fact was eliminated by the Chairman of the Sho@@ v@@ eller Council , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
for the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no time an asset was born to the association .
the sports officials accounted for reimbur@@ sement only and the sports club , for which they had invested a lot of time and money from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money from debt - the liabilities in 2001 amounted to around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then , we stood before the situation : do we continue or lock the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the defend@@ ants , in the bread@@ basket Groß@@ tor of the financial office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then decided to take this task with his colleagues and co @-@ accused .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have fired up money , put our life insurance policies as security at the bench , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , it is not allowed to pay debts .
furthermore , in case of a corresponding financial success , the withdrawal of reimbur@@ sement damages had been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore one part of the expense allowance was paid only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus was on the account .
therefore , l@@ ump and not detailed deviations seemed to occur , the former Ob@@ server explained the processes .
the accounts and austerity books were jointly managed by the two defend@@ ants , the second accused .
why the withdraw@@ als were not disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association didn &apos;t care in detail for financial support , it was important to have only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 against the one of the function@@ ary investigations for office abuse began , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the club account .
these were set@@ backs , the defend@@ ants declared .
this securities account ran to the name of the second defend@@ ant and was not known to the association according to his statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent didn &apos;t know how to answer for a long time .
then he finally said he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about that money , the public prosec@@ utor placed in the room .
the defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damage indem@@ n@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why compensation ? , judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors wanted to know .
the first defend@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association never had any harm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a lawyer ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the official said he had never paid a cent content , he only weighed mil@@ eage and di@@ eting .
on diets , he charged the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added .
the defend@@ ants were not able to instruc@@ t exact documents for the early years .
they were no longer retained after an audit , in which everything had been judged correctly .
mil@@ eage was also covered by the second defend@@ ant .
in his statement , he explained in his statement that all the fixes must be made in cash .
the main hearing will be continued on September 23 with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard presents another 30,000 jobs
in addition to the staff reductions that have been ongoing for three years , the Compu@@ terri@@ ese will be able to disman@@ tle further jobs in the division of the company .
the positions at the US @-@ Compu@@ terri@@ fic Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not find an end .
within the scope of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate divisions .
as a result , costs amounting to EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company divided on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will be dropped from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP employed around 30@@ 2,000 employees .
on the other hand , the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard shares were 2.3 percent .
the company , which has become a large group of printers from the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto , is currently spl@@ itting up in a new society - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data store for companies as well as other services .
both business parts should be listed on the stock exchange .
a once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand from corporate customers to its services set the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer at the latest .
sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent in the third quarter of July at the end of July .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under EUR 25.@@ 4 billion .
as a result , revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HP answers with a spl@@ itting up and massive sub@@ missions on the changes in the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company headed by Me@@ g Whit@@ man has responded late to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers , and more and more businesses do the same online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans show a total of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat action in Iraq , however , would mainly result in rejection : 54 per cent said that 35 percent agreed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that other states fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
24 per cent , on the other hand , are to intervene in the conflict .
a collaboration with the Syrian authorities , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , rej@@ ecting 51 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed would be 20 percent .
29 per cent could not decide .
car : second day of the press at the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show
the focus of the fair is up to 27 September networked , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electro@@ mobility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mobility unites &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the broad public can visit the IAA from Saturday .
the organizers of the Auto @-@ Verband V@@ DA expect approximately 900 000 visitors two years ago .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : breakdown of violence against Hungarian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police deployed at the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke tear gas and water @-@ thro@@ wer against several hundred refugees .
Euron@@ ews @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees crossed the border .
behind it a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen there was a water @-@ thro@@ wer .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially stopped pepper spray .
then the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn a little . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant woman and evi@@ dently injured wife was removed from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees sack@@ ed themselves and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the spokes@@ persons of the Serbian police suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world ob@@ serves when the US central bank comes together on two days , Wednesday and Thursday to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were questioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of the opinion was that the F@@ ed will do so , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates will last from 0 to 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est has been on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank could possibly leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , managing associate at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude outlook on global conditions .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good .
the decision is to be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death shock at Delta State University leaves ap@@ ologies
after shooting and killing his friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry to do with the first murder and , &quot; he could not make it happen , &quot; gave authorities known on Tuesday .
police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for geography and social science education at the Delta State University , called for emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He has shot on a man and killed a man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb said to the staff of the emergency call center that police officers must be sent to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cute dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could reverse it .
I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police surrounded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , &quot; there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they were married for about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was working online at home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who possessed a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les said
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said Lamb has called for relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
lamb was awarded a doctorate in the spring of 2015 by the Delta State University as his life @-@ house on the University &apos;s website .
stars who have lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .
the actor also allegedly fought with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug ownership .
all this certainly demands its tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group
the Lufthansa plans a large group restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
150 of the roughly 1,000 executives around the world will cost the work@@ station .
however , with the pilot trade union , there are new negotiations .
the Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and analy@@ zes the cheap Euro@@ wings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to earnings of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline shared on Wednesday .
among other things , there will be no longer a Board of Directors for the passenger business in the future .
the low @-@ cost airline Euro@@ wings should be developed as independently as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in the Management Board of Chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
with the new setup , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
to date , the organization of the 120@@ ,000 employees was complex .
the airlines operated under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the conflict with the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations will be resum@@ ed after the court @-@ stri@@ cken strike on this Thursday .
that shared the union with .
the theme of the talks should be the retirement arrangements for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wants to come up with a predicted record result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and the airline led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the background is the concept of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the fight against competitors , the Lufthansa points out that the Lufthansa flights are out@@ sour@@ ced to the company &apos;s own cheap line Euro@@ wings .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Manchester League @-@ League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brought the left external def@@ enders to cry and shut it out for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give up hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old sha@@ w was burned into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was brought to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg survey and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then plays fantastic , and then it happens .
in the changing cub@@ icle he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it lasts for six months , and it won &apos;t play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the hanging of an El@@ f@@ rom@@ eter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ w &apos;s account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my path to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
referring to this : Manchester United is suffering from the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the defeat at PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the England Defender has an additional incentive to recover until the next June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , everyone is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital after a b@@ oul@@ der from Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t last long before you know it almost in@@ war@@ dly .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Minister @-@ President for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental fa@@ der of Dr. Se@@ uss , appeared in 1971 .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , as it always seems to have a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
all nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book , instead gives a table of contents of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ race @-@ Ville , where all nature went and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; he reads . a love @-@ interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel , who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if this would not be suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron reads like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ b@@ able that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here , an un@@ named boy hears , like the local environment by the c@@ ash@@ y , trees fal@@ tering , th@@ ang@@ ing Once @-@ ler , &quot; who speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; is devast@@ ated .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax a child twenty times consec@@ u@@ tively .
a Down@@ ing Street Spe@@ aker said that the text was probably come from Cameron &apos;s election circuit .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff but gave no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when you see the cad@@ re who has chosen England for the tour , there is no repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat on my map .
I would not exclude a forward win .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks Site may be less experienced than those three years ago but there are good spin players in the batch setting , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear s@@ cars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as spin @-@ bowling and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test plane , is an option for the attack .
related news : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course hard to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
in his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are oriented towards results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , because - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
a long time ago , one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate .
if he hopefully turns out further sales for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t get such good performances , and that &apos;s not surprising me ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son in front of him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and out .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first deployed Jonathan in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in the highest form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer , whom I treasure high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge Square , which hit us very well .
he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but of course this depends on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to make mos@@ ques beside Cook , which would provide an extra spin Bow@@ ler and get four squ@@ e@@ cks , appeared and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques may not get his job done for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my previous team @-@ mate Justi@@ n Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he appeared in 2001 as Open@@ er .
he made three hundred rounds immediately and didn &apos;t look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see their stat@@ s - average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some wise additions to the coach .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experience , since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful deployment to the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ lah he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes , new voices can bring fresh air in the changing rooms , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ ey &apos;s team mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used in the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule .
and you have to remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken lightly .
the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of Britain from the EU ) could gain access if the economy is in a sl@@ ump in 2017 until 2017 .
David Cameron &apos;s dis@@ gor@@ ical re @-@ trial strategy to keep Britain in the EU will go deeper into trouble with every day , even without the choice of the genius Jerem@@ y . &quot; is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which viol@@ ated Europe heavily on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at once said that some member states are so deeply involved in various crises such as the EU is now and not always of their own guilt , Britain itself created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they end@@ anger the social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
Prime Minister and finance minister climb to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who wishes to stay outside the UK inside the EU tent - &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; Berlin says - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials in some major cities have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as with the exagger@@ ated long @-@ ending such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande is looking for his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a lef@@ tist .
it is difficult to imagine that they will get a leg out to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British whose energy is better deployed to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even deliberately not plan helpful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , during the 2017 presidential campaign 2017 , to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their cost , and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press @-@ one as they did not during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro Opport@@ uni@@ sts , who made himself a name as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone ch@@ opping foreigners and the pseudo @-@ non @-@ in@@ ali@@ ens who own most of our big newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about them , but noticed that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better ban@@ anas are distributed to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans than Bla@@ ir himself when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , as Bla@@ ir had put the principle on the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press has never denied him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly l@@ ump on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he had no time for me to waste - seems to be in danger of repeating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 @-@ s , a mistake at that time and today .
it can last but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position in Europe - I just press it out - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff tendency and the wild fighting of Tor@@ ey &apos;s Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ness can probably say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said that the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ nell as a shadow Chancellor was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but fighting to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and MPs after all reports on their meeting on Monday evening .
whatever the stirring image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it &apos;s right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ en@@ ary campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ nell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks that way .
but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s basic ambig@@ ui@@ ties regarding EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege Economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic arguments .
as with its ambig@@ ui@@ ties to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - in order to make concessions to the British if all this can be point@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded on Monday of something British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum was called .
experts critici@@ ze public health report about e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
alle@@ gations of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined the Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
P@@ he published the &quot; basic report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month resor@@ ted to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y basis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the proof of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the claim of P@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were sum@@ mon@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to bring their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose directors previously had received British American Tob@@ acco Control ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also under@@ wrote BA@@ T references to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the financing he was supposed to have received by the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , they added .
the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not delivered , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide an industry financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco management of P@@ he took part at the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for most products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or restrictions will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said the claims of P@@ he that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were premature . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that the BM@@ J claims were already re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
nearly 80@@ ,000 people die annually on a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by showing up @-@ to @-@ date evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ enders , says former boss of Channel 4
the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs likely to be seen by a smaller audience in harsh controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and TV stations such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get into contact with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communication Committee on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I do not think in the medium or long term for a good idea , you should at least give your production to programs that others do not do or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first class time window because they want to reach as broad support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , of course it &apos;s non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax would finance programs that could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ enders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
frank@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I have to see how this is to be public @-@ judicial television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s blame on the hunt for ratings is &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular programmes reflect what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ OS@@ gart lecture held in Edinburgh in 2003 , suggested that the BBC should sell shows like East@@ enders .
Johnson said that the rather publicly @-@ legal ni@@ ches should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue when they go to their apparent missions for justification of 4 billion pounds of broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put it in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course you all think we all think that you get a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for £ 150 , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should review its ethics mission , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform , train and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example in &quot; inform@@ ing , enligh@@ tening and talking to the public @-@ legal channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
on the question of partnerships El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the one of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial channels Alli@@ ances go in to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in which they are be@@ amed with sound stimul@@ i .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment when they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound stimul@@ i , which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels which respond to ultrasound waves .
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electric impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms generally do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells assigned to them , such as Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when he applies ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ Genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ Genetics might have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which needs to be sent down on an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves may happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , he added .

according to Gav@@ in Gr@@ ind@@ on , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol Designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists will become more critical and try to bring political work to the public outside galleries .
many artists deal with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to go outside into the real world , so that their art has an influence on society .

&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a realistic tender company advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ ep@@ rint with bright colours and animation , it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student resi@@ dences
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those I have anno@@ yed - and the numerous , long @-@ awaited complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the entry into student residence halls ranges from slightly annoying to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to chat : people tell where you come from , whether and where du Sab@@ bat@@ jahr , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &apos;re &quot; honest Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak even if your lashes were burning in fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , film night venues and communal meeting points , but they are also the places where people are dressed and their under@@ wear pick up .
referring to this : don &apos;t remember to start with a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted will receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences create a space @-@ to @-@ space stroll culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I receive the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos ank@@ lo@@ ping : do it .
a guy in my student resi@@ dences had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship through B@@ aking .
as you start the Uni at the high point of the back man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have something baked . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are an an@@ ual b@@ aker .
badly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check that with the dairy owner .
chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even when they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it is annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a pur@@ ge to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb they belong to the people sitting in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse .
a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbours if they had something to do with drum &amp; bass , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they re@@ acted with even more lou@@ der music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before leaving their own music , shut down her door and went to her three @-@ hour trial .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would acci@@ dentally move into the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be very embarrass@@ ing if you have a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , take care of her , separate herself and then see her every day and perhaps experience how she passes all friends together ?
of course , the heart goes through its own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your under@@ body a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has left his keys in his un@@ locked room , the border between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ bbing is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good stroke is funny , but it only takes moments until he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give a valuable and am@@ using lesson through hiding , but never forget someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water which you then put in the freezer - but don &apos;t t@@ ack your hol@@ dings at the ceiling more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single @-@ educ@@ ators , Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ dur@@ ans
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner builds terra@@ ced houses in central Fran@@ con@@ ia for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for example for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the only educ@@ ating mother and the low @-@ ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build and build good today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly convenient living space can be created : he builds in a project row houses for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gymn@@ asi@@ ums has no sustainability .
for people remain in a large part here .
in view of the stream of refugees , we need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a terra@@ ced house needs least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if you put people in blocks .
each of the six houses currently being built in the pilot project consists of three residential units for four asylum seekers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees say it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily changed according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 euros , without grounds .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I carried out my project correctly .
especially complicated makes it always the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ wert special construction and the pitch regulation .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still under construction , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three parking spaces .
only in the cities there is no room for that .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their Rei@@ h@@ enhaus project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who have accused me of creating luxury homes for asylum seekers .
what is definitely not right .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competition for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true , however , we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but were built in luxury apartments that hardly could afford any more .
my project has the message , even ordinary people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the alone @-@ educ@@ ating mother or the ear@@ ner .
I &apos;ll show you how to build and build good today .
that is why it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app , typing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , because they receive an error message that tells us that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to circum@@ vent the problem , users are advised to either wait until the attack returns or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the dele@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it impro@@ b@@ able by stream@@ lining the update . similarly , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue because the phone may switch to half way and this could lead to a demo@@ lition of the update .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s sole motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows only one slogan in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup second pointed out before the start into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the vice world champion in front of the race in Singapore on this Sunday from title defender and double champion Hamilton .

in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Br@@ ite was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will affect the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .

bad Kis@@ singer Chess Club has a prominent member
the Schach@@ club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; was founded three months ago , has added another member to his ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who stayed in Bad Kis@@ singen more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .

G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation received by the chairman Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot afford the membership fee .
youth work and talent seeking should also be promoted .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Rot @-@ Weiß &quot; is seen as an expression of its connec@@ t@@ edness with the city city .
district office looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Old People &apos;s Centre Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the man@@ tle of the Sozial@@ stiftung and opened a new contact point at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
besides consulting , you can also take part in courses there .
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain into the inner city .
more specifically to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , directly next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ing @-@ seekers will receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or health care insurance benefits .
for years we have established with our ambul@@ ant nursing staff that often nursing relatives are left alone .
there are so many questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are also not many benefits offered by the insurance companies because the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained the new house@@ keeper Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the citizen &apos;s hospital as well as for the ambul@@ atory service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as fall prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapy treatment can be used .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Senior Care Centre for Care and Care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the inner city see both business leaders in particular in demographic change .
because this makes a good decentr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future essential .
in addition , as mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined at the inauguration ceremony , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the club meeting at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able join . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well in their familiar environment as possible .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 am to 2@@ pm , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 : 00 to 18 : 00 and Saturday from 10 am to 12 pm .

Vienna architect Karl M@@ ang passed away 92 years old
Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Viennese architecture , is dead .
he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus confirmed on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with M@@ ang the Künstler@@ haus left an honorary member and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most important architects in the second half of the 20th century in Vienna &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as it was called in the dispatch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
born 1922 in Vienna , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical College in Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War .
since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute director .
from 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute for Design .
in the eigh@@ ties , he was commissioned with the establishment of the treas@@ ury in the Hof@@ burg of Vienna and the reconstruction of the palace Lob@@ ko@@ witz in the Austrian theatre museum .
Park@@ rebu@@ ke : Tim Wiese throws a polic@@ ew@@ oman with money
former foot@@ b@@ aller Tim Wiese has fallen asleep in Bremen .
foot@@ ball@@ ers were once , meanwhile Tim Wiese , ex @-@ nation@@ ally @-@ keeper in Germany and at Bremen and H@@ offen@@ heim is engaged , W@@ rest@@ ler .
according to his own statement , he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years .
on the other hand , he did not conc@@ eal his intellectu@@ ally .
Wiese was just cut off the hair in Bremen &apos;s inner city when he saw out how a parking guard stood outside for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , Wiese was stor@@ med from the business , offen@@ ded the civil servant , and threw her the wrong@@ ful fine before the feet , as reported by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the city of Bremen , one confirms alle@@ gations , but it is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after that I decided whether a meadow will be displayed or not .

men beating about 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 a.m. , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 @-@ year old Afghan , followed according to the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft @-@ gas station .
there were also three people on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men now cried to the young people and struck him with his fist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al rup@@ ture and bleeding heavily from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first let off his victim .
from his friends the wounded young man was brought home .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car to their home and drove past several times there .
when one did not see the vehicle any more , the injured went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
with the help of a hammer , one checked on the face and the th@@ igh of the victim .
the injured had to be hospit@@ alized for medical treatment .
up to now there is only a vag@@ ue day description .
one of the men was about 1,80 meters large .
the second ra@@ cket is about 1.@@ 65 feet tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police asks witnesses and indications to report on the phone number 06@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller takes practice field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert also look forward to this .
in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , have luck : there , Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice of Fel@@ steh@@ ausen on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich will still be on the side for his successor in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase Müller opens the practice on 12 October , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at St Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight when the Fel@@ steh@@ aus@@ ens met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who currently completed their professional training at the Ver@@ den Hospital and will also get into practice during the coming year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was ready , I just ph@@ oned them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to practice their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says 39 @-@ year @-@ old mil@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss .
and so it was agreed that the mil@@ ler bought the house with the practice .
however , they continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there , the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller grew up , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed chief physician in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved in voluntary work in the DRC readiness for Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19th the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen operates as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ acional ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mil@@ ler , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as a family doctor .
&quot; the endos@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia mil@@ ler @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the renovation , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
the mil@@ ler receives a subsi@@ dy of a total of 50,000 euros as part of a subsi@@ dy programme ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sam@@ son Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll each quarter , some 2,000 patients come to practice rock breaks every quarter , in the north German average practice it is about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another medical practice .
a positive side effect of the practice takeover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor would have found it , she would have gone too .
anyone who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation hour , inci@@ dentally , continues to look at familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms .
with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all , the doctors have practiced for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen recalls .
she already felt a little melanchol@@ y after a long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I always pressed myself in front of gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also pushed up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still clear that anyone who wants to put a asylum application can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; naturally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do so . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the care and safety of people stand in the foreground . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , neither on the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia is considering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Slovenia denied &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wanted to continue travelling to Austria and Germany , and under certain circumstances establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
thus the Minister of Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ z Z@@ ni@@ dar , did not see in Lai@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ian wants to prevent his borders for refugees but not abri@@ dged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must complete its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ z Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian Government ha@@ sten@@ ed , the first refugees had tried already in the night hours on Tuesday to pass by in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration .
the Croatian police could pick them up in the near corn fields .
according to local media , police vehicles constantly meet new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country tot@@ alled about 4,000 refugees , said Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo were led to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border which previously led migrants to the Hungarian border , re@@ port@@ edly diver@@ ted Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it was the people to propose certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports , in the morning a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were travelling all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border of Serbia around 500 kilometers away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has agreed , so the police said to us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany via Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
with this , it could indeed come to a somewhat further west @-@ situated route to the already predicted postpon@@ ement of the former Balkan @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a slightly further west .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details but pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently delivered a good testimony to the country since then , as far as the standard of border controls is concerned .
on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees will now continue to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic was trying to calm Wednesday at a local eye in Hor@@ gos : he kept the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be about very high refugee numbers at this time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one cannot say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute tickets to the refugees on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok should have heard a ring of cy@@ ber @-@ criminals who have been accused of having provided insight into even un@@ published financial statements and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ ers and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
with the captured information , insi@@ der shops should have been made on the financial markets .
according to the investig@@ ators , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 further accused in the case continued .
most of the defend@@ ants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators should have acted both in the US and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz there is a busy operation .
people do their concerns , partly fast stri@@ de , partly comfortably stro@@ lling .
you control the two stations of the Mann@@ heimer Aut@@ os@@ al@@ ons at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep track of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; puls@@ ating , boun@@ cing life with wonderful autumn sunlight and in the midst four large panels each with the heading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Before I die I want to die .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this action , E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce was aware of its 20 @-@ year existence and is quite faced with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and discussions , such as the volunteer staff .
while managing a pass@@ ant spontaneously to the chal@@ k and watching the sentence &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; go with the camper through the USA , &quot; &quot; stop the war , &quot; or &quot; not long suffer , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again there are little discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only when I realize that at some point the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the Director of the Di@@ ak@@ on@@ ical Plant of Mannheim , which together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband supports the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce .
therefore this public @-@ effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
the fact that not everyone on the tablets does not want to communicate publicly , however , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death is still subject to tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening up of people .
an app@@ rais@@ al that An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid is sharing .
the death and mour@@ ning worker belongs to the volunteer staff of the first hour .
through personal experience confronted with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in the eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid was seeking volunteers , she immediately reported and was involved in the founding in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in Hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent .
all are carefully trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid is able to cope well with her task and experience and experiences .

F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial outlook lowered for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery gi@@ ants lowered its profit forecast for a whole year due to the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in its body transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell over 2.5 percent in Pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said earning a gain between $ 10,@@ 40 and $ 10,@@ 90 in the financial year that ends next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in earlier pre@@ diction .
analysts anticipated a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower view comes despite the price increases , which will be 4.@@ 9 percent on average and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher allow@@ ances for body transport of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November .
the company said that it was nonetheless expected to increase the result compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and growth in online trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yields solid earnings when considering the weaker than anticipated economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
plans for vac@@ ations were announced a day later than that of the rival U@@ PS who plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , the twelve analysts predicted by Z@@ ack Investment Research .
sales increased by 5 percent to € 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ acks asked analysts predicted 12.@@ 23 billion dollars .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has in recent years reported a decline in international priority shipping , which made sales in its unit express shipping to stagn@@ ate .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result decreased due to higher labour costs in cargo business .
in the pre@@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares sank by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at their most anticipated meeting in the year Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week around a 27 foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the tz@@ ar for the first time for almost a decade .
a mur@@ al of the United States is lo@@ oming over them at the end of the embell@@ ished two @-@ storey seating hall .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double mandate from Congress : maxim@@ ising U.S. employment and prices here stable .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision too tight to predict . it will be announced on Thursday that the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented incentive by the near @-@ short short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxious to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it just a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased in@@ security around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which dis@@ sec@@ ures the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently questioned by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
however , the financial markets are expecting a wait of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that only indicates a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mitig@@ ate the blow by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average rose by 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that point , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , she would have to go very far in her declaration to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that an increase in interest would re@@ assure the financial markets , because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed to increase the proposition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the job creation slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level seen by the F@@ ed as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world gathered at the end of last month after China had upgraded its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Value dropped by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would ch@@ okes global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , whereby the Dow is now nearly 10 % below the peak of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market tur@@ mo@@ il influences complex calculation , when one should increase interest rates .
&quot; if events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy have not occurred in the past few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former US staff member .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get the effect better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the global economy is not the main concern of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in its decision @-@ making process .
but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mere hint of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; close &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its monetary expansion , triggered confusion around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect not only to monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of re@@ reactions to financial market movements that are apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ ier , a member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which advoc@@ ates a raise of interest , made decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its incidence by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited recognis@@ able effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lack@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on Inter@@ est Rates of the Bank of England .
the recent turbul@@ ence does not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest because the markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until this is changed I don &apos;t think that it should rush ahead .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Life Assistance for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome , do not go without the commitment of countless volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
they belong to them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach her 74 lectures .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seek@@ er at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , the very different teaching is considered to be at a proper school .
Brazilian Pap@@ al Society Rio Grande fo@@ sters nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to enligh@@ ten women on how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who are su@@ cking to breasts that are painted with representations of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build up a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by approximately 500 calories per day .
however , new research results suggest that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet actually affects women &apos;s genes and protects them from developing tum@@ ors .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the building contract for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atten@@ ed for solar installation .
planning for long @-@ awaited Turn@@ h@@ allen@@ bau at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ welt comes step by step : in the recent council meeting , the completed building contract has been unanim@@ ously agreed upon without major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; prior to that , the Board decided , among other things , to submit an application for an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resp@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion from the valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ ek first and roof over@@ hang &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is supposed to be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background planning is the intended use of the roof@@ ing surface for solar plants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was about the inclin@@ ation of the roof , which was prescribed for energy reasons - unlike in the construction plan - below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this reduces the volume of the hall considerably .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the plan of building on the roof of the roof does not allow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - with the Bern@@ rie@@ der municipal council generally more restric@@ tive in terms of deliver@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the turn@@ around is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create preced@@ ence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and lati@@ tude sports .
in the next step , the building contract for the 18 x 36 meters large hall will now be submitted to the Council of Agriculture .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital shall be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital .
the station as well as the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county , the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß asser@@ ted .
however , a decision about this will happen to the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , 23 September .
should the plans be implemented then all of the nearly 50 employees in the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would continue to work .
the vast majority should be moved to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the remaining internal station .
the rooms are available .
employees who do not have to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the staff will be informed of the plans .
the change was initiated by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
on the question of who should succeed him , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fis@@ her@@ man &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead from October 1st and to change with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upgrading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to agree to both houses , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ank , which has more than 35 beds , should definitely be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after nearly 140 years .
until now , the district circuit had planned this for 2018 , when the ongoing rehabilitation at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital was completed .
Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , met with rum@@ ors that the house , owned by the Bundes@@ rat , should be used as shelter for asylum seekers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shut it out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a daily sy@@ chiat@@ ric psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer on the quasi @-@ reloc@@ ation to the Le@@ ch , who had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as chief physician for over 30 years have not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital ( once 100 beds ) was again threatened by closure in recent decades , departments were closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .

a crime suspect has led the police to the corp@@ se of 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday .
in the inter@@ ro@@ gation the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their corp@@ ses thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has been missing a victim of violence since Saturday .
the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , like the public prosec@@ utor and the police on Wednesday .
on Tuesday evening , an active 20 @-@ year @-@ old is also considered to be a suspect and the investig@@ ator was responsible for the discovery of the corp@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after a visit to the autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquaintances , a crime was finally revealed against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the corp@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , the authorities reported to the authorities that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old were killed and the corp@@ ses placed in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be introduced to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put the burden on him .
the investigation of the immediate circumstances of the action is intended to bring further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the situation in the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for an affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people push for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the Association of Represent@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sozial@@ er housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison , there are 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units in Germany this year .
there@@ with there are 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation .
many come across the housing market and are lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers lived in the last year .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
the study also makes considerable savings in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany is shooting an housing deficit which will grow from year to year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently , some 77@@ 0.000 residential units were already missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many working people therefore lived in large cities in a not@@ orious way in WG rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed longer in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the loud noise on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has fallen for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sozial@@ er housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , new incentives should boost the social housing construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could be avoided on the real estate tax and the basic tax for subsidi@@ zed flats may be suspended . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , according to the alliance , attractive tax de@@ priv@@ ation possibilities are necessary .
the funding programme for refugee lod@@ gings of the Kf@@ W State Bank is already well received by towns and communities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available around 300 million euros have been retri@@ eved on Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free travel : Croatia and Slovenia direct corridor
after Hungary there is practically no passage , because more and more refugees are choosing the way over Croatia .
Zagreb announces to grant transit across Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country Slovenia via the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked with the Sloven@@ ian Interior Minister and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the de@@ position of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border hundreds of refugees have broken up to Croatia in order to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian television station RT@@ L .
Hungary had sealed off its border with refugees on the eve of the day .
new laws that came into force on the same day make regular asylum procedures in Hungary practically superf@@ lu@@ ous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia wants to let the refugees happen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through and we prepare for this opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police attacked the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country Croatia .
according to reports , most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both with the bus and taxis in the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they had tried to walk over the green border to Croatia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not encounter a fence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are other dangers in this respect : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
mine clearance should now quickly create a safe passage .
in Hungary , however , after the closure of the border hardly any more refugees arrive .
on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 people attacked .
shortly before closing on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws mark the overcoming and damage of the border zone as a crime .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
sentenced to five years imprisonment and deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications have been received on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ ons &quot; border , of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees detained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; practically no one has a prospect of granting asylum in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers shall be deported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they gathered the rub@@ b@@ ish that had left tens of thousands of people in the past weeks at the road@@ side .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; barrier &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps in the border town has been rebuilt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no one wanted to express itself to the goal of this reconstruction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only reaches a few refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants were still in the country after government declarations .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by the instructions of German authorities .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge festival on Sunday , when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly set railway traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the stream of refugees , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the stones along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we first made the un@@ hoped @-@ able guests , with snack and drinks .
we have said the same , we bring it by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N talk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let it take a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that made us very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday evening in W@@ els , the str@@ anded train pass@@ ers had switched from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passa@@ u , in order to attempt at the short @-@ term announcement that the rail transport to Germany was set , but still trying to cross the border .
the regional train was stopped at the Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday was soci@@ able , day before a two @-@ brid@@ le run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends further tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately at the establishment of structures to ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has formally established the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ kreis district of National Socialism .
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge to produce decent conditions for protection seekers in the face of the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof quarters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad has all hands to do with the flood of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to set up quarters for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first pick @-@ up centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already gotten a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the placing of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was carried out without a big whi@@ rl@@ wind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; masterpiece &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the Ministry of Interior spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crisis @-@ like situation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Konrad expects a demand of 85@@ ,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings must be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without floor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial capitals .
they would have assured him of creating quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , thereby clari@@ fying how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations on the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps as we do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
private persons can easily offer accommodation on the platform .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that stand empty in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it could not be that district employers have to respect a certain amount of the towel holder or size of the overhead duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period of time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Interior Ministry , he succ@@ eeds Konrad with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom you don &apos;t say without further into the face of un@@ truth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not inc@@ ur the Republic as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
so far the search for district search has not been successful .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better distribution
for now no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as the persons concerned are currently unable to accommodate these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further sites are to be tested for their suitability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; criticism exercises the city chief in the division of refugees within the federal state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other districts also have to make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; boundaries are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) reported on Monday the further action in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders will not be sealed off .
the continuing journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist .
however , the seek@@ er would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the issue of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger , Austria is now also &quot; a logical consequence &quot; from the action of the Germans .
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general restoration of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrial line is officially closed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can imagine investing in startup companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard , and later on which can be acquired .
from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
about 1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the Land of Upper Austria and the Federal State ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is designed by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 per cent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of residual surface in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second business in the arcade
in the new shop , Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the centre of attention .
in fact , Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she has now received an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the business , in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are starting from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
prior to that , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long wondered if I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Vene@@ to producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of a location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the large room Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has brought birth from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , the professional lady cannot answer with last security .
perhaps it &apos;s because a nice bag uses every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are named An@@ ders .
this property also links many people with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
whether it mani@@ f@@ ests itself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia , regards journalists or revealing knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. presidential office is power@@ ing the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cuts off well .
this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire originate .
the New Yorker with the fo@@ eh@@ fres@@ her is a term many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine road .
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ place is related to him via -@@ zig corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del made a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous shoots , to which beside Tru@@ mp also the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also speaks in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also den@@ ounce the opinion that Tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is already a bit a big mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the vicinity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in High German : the An@@ ders , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant in the USA for gold dig@@ gers .
foundations of the real estate company were the first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland for a long time failed in the Bavarian State to whom the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged at that time .
he did not record Tru@@ mp , because he was once without permission , the director of the Institute for pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Geschichte und Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared a film start .
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an illegal emig@@ rant .
this contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descend@@ ant .
he had repeatedly argued against Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tru@@ mp ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the wine @-@ gro@@ wer in retirement sees the Americans more dist@@ anced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so br@@ ittle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine this , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pen@@ sion@@ ra@@ ins Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm mentioned like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ , which generally arrived well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that of Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they would be better if he did not make the choice , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ ws at the time of his grandfather in the United States would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would have never been there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ eg@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without President Tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tru@@ mp has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , even in the United States the interest awak@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavarian town Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the hand of the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants of the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ bers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite the attempts of N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son hurry to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of leadership in the Liber@@ als , but there have been no major shifts in the Today reviews .
the N@@ ine &apos;s breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital , as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Ri@@ val Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a one @-@ week series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the distance seemed to have no role for Australian TV viewers as Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 spectators in the five major cities compared to today , Today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , Today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , in recent months Today , the gap to Sun@@ rise was closed .
in August , Today , Today the average 3@@ 18@@ ,000 reached the 33@@ ,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
up to now , in September , Sun@@ rise stands at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning men more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle on New Zealand &apos;s coast with his two children , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could wear a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and struck easily The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5 : 30 pm ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 p.m. to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia generated 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour s@@ led 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that failed to sni@@ ff the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three agree : b@@ achel@@ or &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins the b@@ achel@@ or .
the woman , who finally lands Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was sh@@ rou@@ ded in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who has received the last rose .
but when we arrived with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three , you may be mistakenly given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have worked in a ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should W@@ oods receive last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; their answers could become a game destro@@ yer who won the heart of the b@@ achel@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everyone named Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki quickly - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the very first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed energies and S@@ ams energies , I sen@@ sed that they were quite compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home visit last week made her clear that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; One . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now un@@ reserv@@ edly set on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked to choose who Wood , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls alike - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the b@@ achel@@ or will be broad@@ cast@@ ed on ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the US - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day late last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ ka as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ ver@@ ts at his first Pun@@ t Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a also strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his crazy catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t , which was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian band had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy to 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a bad start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , you only take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut at that time in 2007 when a passport brought to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area .
overall , it was nevertheless a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W fall retreat in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt before a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there are not new teachers for the many new students : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get voc@@ ations in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Sunday fraction of Free voters will take place until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
actually , quite different main themes were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum is transferred to Klau@@ sur , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protective zones for refugees in Syria , just as it existed during the Yugoslavia during the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one the Free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is why Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critici@@ zed that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards of federal states throughout Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria is pushing off , others don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the country politics in the metrop@@ olitan city should not fall under the table .
a long lasting hit remains on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year , the minister of Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot project &quot; Mittel@@ stufe Deutsch &quot; at 47 gymn@@ asi@@ ums , where an extension of the high @-@ school intermediate level is tested by three to four years .
but that &apos;s not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all high school students who want to do that .
free drive at G@@ 9 everywhere where it is desired .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber missi@@ les into a crowd of people demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , leader of district officials , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , with some of them throwing stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police had used tear gas and then shot into the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , known to be killed , but traditionally used as a less le@@ thal alternative , obviously produced such a high rate of death .
the confrontation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nep@@ al@@ ese Southern plains where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ rel@@ i say that new provinces that are formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus that want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th century .
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been governed centrally for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ator accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legislature voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the grounds at Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square metre area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet .
Em@@ den - Em@@ den wants to market a plot of 4,000 square meters in direct proximity to the Old Post Youth Centre .
the preparations for this are underway .
the plan is to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commercial and living .
it is waiting for appropriate offers , that is to say on the part of the city .
which investor in@@ quired is not yet clear .
no contracts were concluded .
the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property that is located at the Ring@@ straße / corner of Great Street , bought already a few months ago and demol@@ ished the building on it .
H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning of the Holiday House on the Little Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
many An@@ li@@ eger are still worried - they fear the res@@ ale of their leisure fu@@ gi@@ um
months have been negotiated behind closed doors , p@@ onder@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now there are plans for a new holiday resort on the Little Sea near Em@@ den on the table .
Inter@@ esting , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the city development committee of the Em@@ de Council .
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP faction , which accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ enbach went to the offensive from the System Bau @-@ Management : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we did not answer all questions yet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is good to meet all the rum@@ ors now .
the roughly ten to twelve million euro project has been in the discussion for months .
hef@@ ty reactions among Meer@@ bu@@ den@@ land@@ ern , who had come to the meeting , highlighted the pictures and new details about the desired hotel construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea and member of the board at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a giant cla@@ d that overlooks all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like several other project critics that the traffic should increase sharply due to the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the bus @-@ loads must come , so that it pays off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is happening on the well one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant , however , is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ isch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans are still variable .

Google starts dou@@ bling donations campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to raise the $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees fle@@ eing the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the Don@@ ation call on his blog .
instead of making a manager the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who has fled to Kab@@ ul with her family , when she was seven years old about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark train and bus drives , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / are doubled to 11 million $ .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for overweight diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity operations have proven to be efficient for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been conducted among people who are obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain measure of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I above 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c acid formation - medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation dropped from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at 29 .
among those undergoing a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes was dissolved completely and at 28 % in part .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , the diabetes was completely dissolved only at one percent and in some cases at only about two percent .
in addition , the results were found in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol in general better in the &quot; surgical group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood glucose levels over time .
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results with the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ ein angi@@ ot@@ omy ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved higher rates in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported a complete over@@ growth of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who underwent an obesity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly attached their bodies to obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is an issue that is increasingly observ@@ able in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly at school times , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and this falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally , we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional writer was raised in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East was lying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist guide demanded an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama spoke to the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , which is dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed in front of the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you must think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and true development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we must think about how killing will be dimin@@ ished in their countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the issue of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on September 11 and turned out that the violent reaction of the US attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I put my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he set violence , and this prov@@ oked unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase in the intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
poison control centres in the US report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve who swallow hard alcohol disinf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue from disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age , reported the poison control centres , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more and more involved in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them enter the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink dis@@ infection only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have supposedly mixed dis@@ infection with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent that are very appealing for children .
hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially for small children a few spra@@ yers can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , Medical Director of the poison centre hospital at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the station Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t let slip whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it then it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ hai@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who had recently taken four sp@@ lashes from after straw@@ berry scent @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was brought into an emergency room .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that was considered drunk in an adult by law , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ hai@@ jah l@@ ul@@ led her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors supervised them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had thrust his head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ hai@@ j@@ ahs &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store dis@@ infection products outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with fat@@ alities .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January three students of the fourth class in the state of New York planned to poison their &quot; gem@@ a &quot; teacher by filling anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; he reported a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
the police examined the s@@ add@@ led plan as &quot; Gesch@@ w@@ ät@@ z &quot; and instructed discipl@@ in@@ arian measures to the school authority .

there are ru@@ mo@@ urs about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected spontaneously by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insi@@ sted that he and his team comrades are not under increased control as they prepare themselves for confrontation with the Dutch table leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football bored Dut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers mid @-@ field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of Celtic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the ran@@ gers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Firm games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian chef s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now faces five points ahead clearly at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before and we &apos;ll come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel that exactly this way - but we have to go on .
we really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better .
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ ti@@ ously at January @-@ transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago , indicating that he hur@@ ried several January transfers , R@@ angers boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious when signing new additions and insi@@ sts that he does not want to distur@@ b the unit of the I@@ bro@@ x squ@@ ad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in the summer have this season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group during this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic target person Mik@@ u with reference guide
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation , indicated that he can withdraw when his contract exp@@ ires with the Sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pla@@ gu@@ ed with a troubles@@ ome kn@@ u@@ ck@@ le for two years and has not managed the departure from Wales this summer .
Hear@@ ts set on S@@ FA battle for N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s comments
the Hear@@ ts introduced 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent out of the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of Defender was later removed - the third red card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said , and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have not ann@@ ot@@ ated power . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le
the cor@@ rigi@@ ble Hi@@ bee was instructed after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive texts about ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the Ros@@ eb@@ urn area of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; said the Stür@@ mer , and added : &quot; it &apos;s safe to say that I don &apos;t come back to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot;
the Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that the executive board of Dun@@ dee United still has confidence in the management team to turn things - but confess that the decline in the field must end .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back to Tra@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to win against Hamilton . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team from Aber@@ deen desper@@ ately needed to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cies to win a seventh consecutive league victory , giving them a margin of five points in front of Celtic on the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ &apos;s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no squ@@ ads who won all that won &apos;t win the games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK it is increasing .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May until July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above the figure of 5.5 percent as shown by the figures in the Office for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken disrup@@ ts the process
because the security guards could not be satisfied , the staff called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray the officials were able to take the stor@@ ks into custody .
a breath @-@ alcohol test resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0.@@ 89 per mil@@ le .
the adolescents were picked up by his mother .
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2,@@ 15 pro@@ mil@@ le and remained in custody .
why I &apos;m witn@@ essing an ec@@ ution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
somewhat later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope that it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber at the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison gas .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January , about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would provide a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists may see exec@@ utions in the US , and since often more applications are available than places , a mak@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery will take place to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who is selected will be able to watch it emotion@@ ally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have been able to form@@ ulate &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong what I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I have said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve made .
I don &apos;t want to go into all the details again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe that there is a strong likel@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters you can contact .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man dying unnecessary death .
man after damp police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he talked to the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang down the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , a few metres from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was sum@@ mon@@ ed to Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of Cann@@ ing River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in water and said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good police officer negoti@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to float over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins Bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end racing .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy on his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he pointed to the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt tu@@ ff rehear@@ sal at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had with@@ held for 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age alle@@ gations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk about raised head and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a coach .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb blast in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had attempted to spy on his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I &apos;m going to name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information on what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they seem to believe that I am a sc@@ amm@@ ate .
if that is the case , they should certainly take part in their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to hold me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today .
should that take me to believe that it becomes personal ?
did the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now thinking about it .
but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the frustr@@ ations levels of the trainer have been built up with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt study , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching caused him to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throw up his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which pushed against the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees has mistakenly applied mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been like yesterday evening .
it would have been like yesterday the whole day , which was also like that .
but it also had so on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy beats against ri@@ vals for claims to ring fight back
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the tac@@ kling of its players as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbitr@@ ators allowed the Storm @-@ Player &quot; E@@ Q@@ AS &quot; with his team during the high Storm winner in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co &apos;s Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made an almost disgu@@ ise remark about the storm team after his crew achieved the Final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; sample &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the tac@@ tile of his team and said that they were concentrated only on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during tac@@ kling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers on his team is confident that they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always appears - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring fights when they struck us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that in the whole year we have changed nothing in our defensive system or the techniques . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real focal point , and this has provided us with the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . therefore , he is probably not used to getting used to it , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny how this time is coming up again and again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy hat Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wa@@ yne is talking about exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said that he will take care of a trick .
but now he has a team that can play and that we watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game that you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his way of playing football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as they play .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about having to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ co versus Cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is it an exciting game ?
or are p@@ auses doing and no points something exciting ?
for me it is the game boards .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase .
the Storm team released this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday night in the pre @-@ fin@@ als at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bians with 200,000 $ deposit after drug use
a man who could possibly have a lifel@@ ong punishment due to his attempt to get into possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine , smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a b@@ ail of 200,000 dollars .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ accused in the marina during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for trying to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café could have been from a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of a criminal complaint he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 as security in order to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ ous declarations of the two persons , it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on the deposit , under the conditions that he canc@@ els his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports daily at the police and stops at 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab tears apart
at a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved were bra@@ ked in front of a permanent building site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to move to the left at the last moment , as the police broke .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ causing driver broke completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 am .
there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone from girls to enti@@ ce pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es to send pictures
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of a 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when she was asleep , log into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of in@@ decent pictures of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it through , found the confusing messages and immediately al@@ er@@ ted her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; Web searches &quot; that used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg claimed that he did it because it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le on the internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prosec@@ utor of E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a addiction to frigh@@ ten people .
he admitted that the search on the computer were carried out by him , but he said it happened because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and that he asked to send more photos .
he said he did so to l@@ ure her .
he said he was ill in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on trem@@ bling and weeping .
she also saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the defend@@ ant used computers and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk with girls who looked much younger than he did .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to have in@@ decent pictures taken by children on 14 June last year , to have viol@@ ated the conditions on January 25 this year , and did not appear before the court to attend a hearing on 24 March this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defence counsel Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the Register of sexual offen@@ ders , argu@@ ing that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be found in his off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October , in order to obtain background reports on social work .
Ho@@ gg was granted in this case security deposit but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings in other cases pending .
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of judgment .
Schle@@ user switches to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken out of the border control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many floo@@ d@@ gates were made of fear of discovery and arrest the people increased more at smaller border cross@@ ings
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the river river Inn in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they were on foot via bridges and dust @-@ guns to the German side .
there they are received by federal police and passed on to register .
compared to the beginning of the week , more refugees arrived at Munich Main Station in comparison to the start of the week .
there were around 700 people in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 o &apos;clock , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city .
Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the southwest expected
meteor@@ ologists warn against storm fires in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air is currently in the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart has announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful low is the prec@@ ur@@ sor of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who was drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in the past few days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are especially expected in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , even in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and at the Lake Constance District with bu@@ cks from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday you can see the sun again for a longer time .
the mass makes it : every two years , the automobile manufacturers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
in 2015 , the compact car is particularly well @-@ known for the compact cars that are currently selling well .
cars from the compact class are currently particularly popular : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations accounted for this segment in August alone .
this is reflected in the IAA ( public stage 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new luxury cars and luxury cars , many new compact models will be introduced this year .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive .
Rüssel@@ sheim . Opel presents an entry below the largest competitor VW Golf in view , starting at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra cost from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hessen offers further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which include three @-@ cylinder petrol engines for the first time .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which will also be seen at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA for new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competitors Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is to be seen exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and a high@@ lighting sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes from the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
with the new model , the Nissan investor wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines adapts fully to the brand &apos;s design line .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are human un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the prison Te@@ gel , who was housed in a small cell for months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the violation of human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision issued on Wednesday .
according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were confined within a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful : he was accommodated in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , was now on a free foot , had been transferred to a larger cell .
his arrest warrant for the un@@ di@@ gni@@ fied detention conditions against the Land Berlin failed .
however , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ als and rejected the case for the re @-@ examination there .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if for legal reasons only a few days of prison days are author@@ itative for compensation , a compensation claim was given . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fear the personality of the personality &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chamber of Appe@@ als must now clarify the amount of the compensation damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Constitutional Ju@@ dges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of imprisonment in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus they spoke only in April to a prisoner of damage because he was imprisoned in a cell naked .
un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 also the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , in addition , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had an in@@ decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the then pla@@ inti@@ ff was accommodated daily between 15 and 21 hours daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Car@@ ls@@ bad case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines due to lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ siveness increases , even to hits should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Justiz@@ pres@@ se@@ amt , 21 jobs in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to young defects , 19 are to fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
according to the Federal Ministry of the Interior , around 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to the statement by Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again , we can do this and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) dwell@@ ings annually - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built up to now ( 250@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental properties : 60@@ 000 to 80@@ ,000 social apartments fall out of the rental price , and these especially favorable apartments will also apply to refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social apartments would have to be built every year and therefore the Federal Government would have to invest EUR 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
scientists and federal government ministers agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked about their qualifications in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees , it is crucial to find employment in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political shift in Germany : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to recognise work .
while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the obligatory duty to limit asylum seekers to a place of residence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society , too , because of the shortage of skilled workers , the perspective has consistently prevailed that refugees should be facilit@@ ated faster access to the labour market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is a lack of German knowledge .
until now , there is still no adequate offer of general and job @-@ related language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts .
in view of Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the construction of networks is the Königs@@ weg path to work integration .
the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the un@@ rooted parents it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ gg@@ able , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration is distributed in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators rise sharply by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to raise training capacities - for example by allowing more specialised schools .
in the countries students are prepared with no knowledge of German in welcome classes .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ afford from the Berlin School Administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 per cent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal land prohibited asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , inner sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his attitude .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; study willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated by access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for refugees with a reimbur@@ sement or toler@@ ation do not receive any services according to the asylum application law if they start studying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter do not generally receive a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , as they do not fall under the circle of eligible persons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months .
but this financing gap must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
Islam will play an important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essively sweep the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and to further develop the existing state church law into a new state religion relationship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would also be important to establish an Islamic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; welfare association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which is professional about the newcom@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
duties also belong to the rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant him certain control options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also includes willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to au@@ gment such conflicts in Germany immediately &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integration will be a topic of the whole society in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the majority society will also have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more urgent .
Germany indeed - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a universal equality law since a decade .
but it learns very slowly , as the NS@@ U murder series showed that the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and non @-@ white Germans are demanding for a long time and what international agreements like the anti @-@ racism convention in Germany commit must become reality in the next few years if the country is peaceful and its new citizens should use its possibilities - for the benefit of all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , Germany is able to medi@@ cally supply the previously expected refugees , medical @-@ president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery writes .
&quot; as far as man@@ - power and capacities are concerned , we do this , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel .
however , additional money must be incorporated into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery demands to susp@@ end all arri@@ vals immediately after registering health cards .
provided services could later be deduc@@ ted from the federal states .
and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to break down so many people with the limited power catalogue that envis@@ ages the asylum application law .
otherwise the doctors make the language barrier more important .
so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are po@@ orer informed about their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , even in medical practices , interpreting costs would have to be taken over , it demands .
but many refugees have already been helped with more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
among refugee children , there is much more un@@ treated disability , and with young people it is about HIV clari@@ fication .
but with some other diseases , German doctors come from their education , but Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ est@@ ation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians would have a highly developed educational system , several refugees are even doctors .
to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualification and possibly take ex@@ ams again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill based on estimates by the Bundes@@ psycho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
especially vulnerable are refugee children , &quot; explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study by the Technical University of Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee camp arrives traumati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder are suffering from so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong sho@@ ck@@ ness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms being chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z declared .
to date , however , only four per cent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill @-@ seeking asylum seekers can submit an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , the treatment usually lasts for several months .
in addition , in the social offices there are mostly non @-@ skilled workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses , whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal thres@@ holds and unique entertainment .
now Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to the man@@ ege on a brick @-@ like v@@ ases to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ h and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current stage staging . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift for the lovers is thus in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to get rid of people from their daily routine and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with world city flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst calls his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the program of the cir@@ cus convin@@ ces with talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent films , it wants to take the Cuban duo loose .
light@@ ness and flexibility - they identify with these words .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is to conquer women &apos;s hearts by storm .
besides numerous salmon @-@ sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with finger@@ tips and articul@@ ation .
balancing with the wheel on a ball ?
for He Yu@@ an no problem .
snake @-@ humans fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to different animal welfare organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it &apos;s not good for our animals , it &apos;s not good for us too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called , will be read from the eyes as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to fall into the arena .
so the upper@@ most command : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the family Pro@@ bst is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 people , we always do our best and we are there with all our heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to his performances every day from 17 to 20 September .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the presentation at 5 pm the prices are dis@@ counted .
it is also open every day from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe positions wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s el@@ dest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med but the video of the fall quickly spread over social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also ro@@ uted by asser@@ tions by members of the opposition that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with him .
last month they had boo@@ sted him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in the parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the Spe@@ aker of Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told journalists about Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it warns the members of Parliament that the immunity in parliament ends , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will build up to 30.000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will likely build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will split into two listed companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and service activities .
the expected job reduction leads to a burden of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who should lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise is smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that help companies transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ matched , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it spl@@ its a company founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard to manufacture electro @-@ systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to manage the return from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this sector based on the belief that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger pointed towards Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play back before Christmas .
this optim@@ ist scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and in the face of its history , his participation in the next summer will certainly still be uncertain .
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that didn &apos;t heal properly .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different Wil@@ sh@@ ere diseases since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsenal &apos;s 15@@ 7 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture of Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , which have recorded most of the vulner@@ ability .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes when you come back from injury , you have a period of time , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win combat power , &quot; explained Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will go through a career that he deserves .
Arsenal will start his Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the match against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and treat the players who need it to get a little break @-@ off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the largest in@@ timi@@ dating effect in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dynam@@ o is also defeated after 41 games after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign was launched in the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsenal has pulled the lesson from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains committed by far hope to lead the club to its first European ok@@ al triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked in Arsenal .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show , which gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the lack of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up now has become more dou@@ bt@@ ful than ever before , such as suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a her@@ edi@@ tary life ) 2015 announced the year of the man with the aim of questioning the culture that men hin@@ ders to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms stated that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends first , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication conducted through social media , with its emphasis on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a significant contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and how a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared money can really not buy luck .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when playing football in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can relate to it , even if they often with@@ hold their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the pastoral care it told me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my hearing role for people who feel de@@ pressed and are self @-@ orda@@ ining , really showed me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often don &apos;t feel able to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you speak openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it presents clearly the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day completely re@@ designed setting , why do not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .

di Maria meets to help PS@@ G , Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ ö .
Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass on Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G player who made the French champion the way , but afterwards she missed a number of occasions before she finally raised her head when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk in group A , Paris also requires a strong start against the Swedish Master , as they do not only strive for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but as they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the club with whom he started his illustri@@ ous career back in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause problems and to look back relaxed even if there are certain things we have to perfect during the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which was able to hold a 2 : 2 un@@ decided at its own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing @-@ stor@@ mer was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over last month by Manchester United , and he indicated why , when he went in to Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense , before he passed to Johan Wil@@ and passing beautifully into the long corner of the grid .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to achieve this stage , joined with nine national players in the field and was a heavy opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field .
but besides a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little to attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave himself up , with some mis@@ ses and bad connections , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who in no less than five trials sli@@ pped in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after the restart .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c to turn the Di Maria into a shot that was diver@@ ted by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth season gate after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the final result was low before replacement players Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a gate at the end .
the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; qualifying games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hats off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core collects 2.5 billion $ by stock sales
the Swiss @-@ based mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , which is affected by collap@@ sing raw materials prices , collected 2.5 billion $ on Wednesday by a stock sale as part of its huge school identity plan .
the Gl@@ en@@ core business registered in London said in an explanation that it sold new shares worth about $ 1.6 billion to pay off its own debts .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling raw materials prices because China &apos;s economic down@@ turn presses demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
the issue of reference rights brought Gl@@ en@@ vy &apos;s share price to the top of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning at the trade in early Wednesday morning .
the share jumped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 P@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ en@@ core had announced last week the 2.5 billion $ stock sales as part of the comprehensive plans to wipe around a third of its 30 billion $ debts .
the company sold the new shares to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the group .
concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by approximately half , coal , copper and other commodity prices decreased by 20 to 40 percent .

Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday .

the U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a State D@@ iner , after the two leaders have bilateral talks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President &apos;s visit will provide the opportunity to bro@@ aden the American @-@ Chinese cooperation in a series of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi can give the opportunity to construc@@ tively address areas of dis@@ agreements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adds the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI , initially announced in February , is expected to meet several US technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before going to New York City at the UN General Assembly in September .

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago just before the obligation of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times poker winner , four times champion league winner , two times champion champion , two times champion champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is stunning .
in the summer the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi now reveals that he was standing at Barcelona before the Euro 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything at that time , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered version of FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; f@@ um@@ ig@@ saw wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reminder : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
guar@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is now working for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I played a great European . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns played with X@@ avi 2008 / 2009 ?
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the entire distance on the lawn , switched the reds out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the king &apos;s victory at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ted the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown while discussing the diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown under@@ lined the need for alternative perspectives , with reference to a black prot@@ agonist in the chosen screen@@ play of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about diversity , then do it with the occupation of the film and not during the scor@@ ing of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the actors of The Marti@@ an established themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invite people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the character of the Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a N@@ ut@@ te , beaten by her white band@@ age .
the producer of Dear White People set up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the film directing rights . Dam@@ on replied that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something we do not want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the Social Media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their variety - that &apos;s SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the twe@@ ets earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4.000 list@@ ings since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when exact racial representation in the media is at the head of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white police in 2014 , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved nationwide impact and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against coloured covers .
in February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album quiet matter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation as a response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck whether the group should be considered a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le invited to visit the Pope in order to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope , it is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowned first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first athlete to win the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could finish all stages of its obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the last task belonged to climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ fought win , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his pile of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so all of a sudden .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how it is ... the future is unknown .
the executive producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and the life changes , he receives the great gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll get some gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received crowds of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aks past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in the bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers were reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfect against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field on Tuesday .
the T@@ wins spent a chance to climb within a half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , though only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so difficult to grasp about a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all wins make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad ej@@ mus .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit the 1 / 3 inner ring 6 times and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw each game in the bull@@ pen , and therefore I want to go quite concentrated into the game .
the designated tiger hit Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two races , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Navy on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the Schla@@ gh@@ ol@@ z , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( punch training ) , clearly looked better at the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three rounds at the end of the seventh session , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
Right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon introduced his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy passed the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the design@@ ate R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run tear from the right @-@ handed drummer Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the finish @-@ run at the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the leading 27th time in the Major League in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a double play
after Detroit added a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth session , Wall created a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the booth of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed people stab@@ bed S@@ ano on three pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
at the beginning of the game , Detroit benefited from an even more mobile Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers scored three rounds in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been canc@@ eled before the game from the injury list , after he was missing more than a month due to a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the start I wanted , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first time , H@@ ushes delivered a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to the game , which made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the runners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second one @-@ out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he was not particularly well beaten , but he caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
Hu@@ gh@@ es came to three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four strokes .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired because of an injury to the throwing school .
he was examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the injury list due to a shoulder @-@ distortion , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is painted by the injury list to fight against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30 July
he has been missing on the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people involved in this will then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the City of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening .
it counted 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital were prepared for this event in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stay there .
they will then be distributed to other municipalities .
in the past ten days alone , according to the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Gi@@ essen , responsible for the inau@@ g@@ ural meeting , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in H@@ esse .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the decisive re @-@ thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective departure &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , we were glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed by military participation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid for refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
in Germany , Austria has again introduced checks on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany too has not sent refugees back to Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it &apos;s been agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the question of an agreement on which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said , there have already been talks between the General Director of Public Security and Represent@@ atives of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they did not call concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit next week together with several other EU leaders .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far not been able to agree on a common action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of further 120@@ ,000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced Merkel in the late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of deliber@@ ation with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined that people who need protection also complain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he who doesn &apos;t have a lead perspective can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this view was strongly divided in the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now deal with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkans route .
Hungary closed its 175 km long border with Serbia on the night of Tuesday .
a few hours later the government in Budapest announced to set up the border with Romania with a fence .
this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wanted to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from smu@@ g@@ gling across Romania , Hungary Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had crossed the fence .
in Turkey , according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports , thousands of other migrants reported on the way to the Greek border .
spatial son@@ ic &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; inv@@ ents ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ice @-@ punch of the Satur@@ n@@ monds , En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us sw@@ aps a global ocean .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these include researchers from observations of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , the moon turns easily on its orbit around the Ring Plan@@ ets .
this motion of exchange is only small , but still too large for a continuous cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state New York ) on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already longer it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had already discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds , sp@@ it water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the south pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers then closed .
however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not clear .
R@@ ama is missing several weeks in Munich
the 1860 München must ren@@ ounce Val@@ det R@@ ama around a month at the offensive actor Val@@ det R@@ ama .
an investigation revealed an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury in the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association distributed .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich @-@ based lion , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presumably four weeks forced break &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a serious loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we need to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a uni@@ form@@ less professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain lots of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy and sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his lean line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because Man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
nevertheless , the exotic fruits are healthy : they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. above all , man@@ go contain much vitamin A and its prec@@ ur@@ sor to beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support visual power , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , Man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel @-@ color alone doesn &apos;t say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives hearty dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads like ch@@ ic@@ ory and ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney matches well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .
the US parcel service U@@ PS re@@ stores up to 9@@ 5,000 aid for the Christmas business in the USA .
the company already started the recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS shared on Tuesday .
above all , drivers are sought .
already last year , U@@ PS had raised its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 aid .
given the bo@@ oming on @-@ line business , U@@ PS and his rival F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making arrangements for the Christmas business since last year .
in 2013 , delayed deliveries had brought a harsh criticism to the parcel services .
first fo@@ eh@@ ement , then striking cold @-@ front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alp@@ enn@@ ines side of the F@@ öhn wind , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz ha@@ sten@@ ed on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday the F@@ öhn winds partly with storm strength through the fo@@ eh@@ ner valleys .
after fo@@ aming on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest current .
on the alpine side , on the night , the fo@@ eh@@ n breaks through the valleys .
as a result , the F@@ öhn winds up to Thursday morning in the bo@@ oming valleys with bu@@ cks of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn can advance in places to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even or@@ kan@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dri@@ es for summ@@ ery temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , moisture begins to dust off at the Alp@@ ens@@ ü@@ d@@ slope .
here the rain begins , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , south of the Alps in the next 48 hours with some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter are expected , this has already fallen large amounts of rain in the last few days .
on Thursday morning , the blow dri@@ es out the air , as a result a cold front is rolling with strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east via Switzerland .
along with the cold front the wind refresh@@ es strongly to stor@@ my , and temperatures rise sharply .
the following days are present in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the weekend , it becomes sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now holds a Martin Luther place
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther King in Rome .
in the presence of City President Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on Wednesday by the name of the German Re@@ former .
in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the ancient Rome just next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working community of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often live their faith only in secret for centuries as a minority .
with the place I become visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city then as a for@@ get@@ ful sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
his negative impressions are likely to have strengthened him by historians in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the split of the Western Church with his theses against the ab@@ las@@ si@@ fication .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the crown of thorns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which has now appeared with splendid pictures .
in the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated in 150 motives his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has preserved the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but it is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective subjects , this can be quite dark .
Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project for about three years , for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cycles &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are devoted to topics such as cross @-@ way , pla@@ gues , commandments or fa@@ ther@@ land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this he immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to Luther &apos;s publishing house with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books .
and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who , on the basis of painting , dealt with the respective Bible passages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and so into today , translated into current contexts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of old painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quotation of Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately triggers for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict Protestant sovereign Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since education has been done with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work out to bear me again with the Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to revi@@ ve art again in a quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of pic@@ torial worlds is today marked by advertising , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is displaced .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewers fall into the images , let them look at them , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; the picture looks for his counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art to be : &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
old did not pay attention to the Bible completely , but also selected the most important and mysterious subjects .
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the images , the text only explains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther Publishing , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and also the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opening on 15 November at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn ( BM@@ X )
plans made , place found , companies commissioned to model earth moun@@ ds for a round course : a year later almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X train was finished again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration ensured dr@@ uss , especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the railway . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so hill deported , new space searched - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will take place in October , the First municipal council Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen even more visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works at the former indoor pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B expands its commitment to refugees up to 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga sets a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football re@@ acts to the sharpen@@ ing situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in dealing with the pending problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been keeping this for the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle , that &apos;s nothing about me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has to be interested in getting a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chanc@@ ellery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. O@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football could help and wool .
but the decisive turn@@ out must be the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the German Football Association has extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation , we ensured that this programme continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the br@@ ink of the UEF@@ A convention in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already this weekend , the 36 professionals will sign a clear sign when they will carry the print &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sports director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a matter of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes everyone , nobody can see it away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we can use football @-@ states , no , we have to use our jet force , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the league &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European quali@@ fier against Hungary on this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 Lic@@ ens@@ ing clubs in their places had started their own projects is great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this and next year , the association together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government will provide € 300@@ ,000 for the integration of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have retri@@ eved the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP CEO loses an eye in case of accident
the Chief Executive Officer of Europe &apos;s largest software corporation , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has reported several reports by a fall in early July .
in the accident on the staircase in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he fell on a glass glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost bleeding , impot@@ ent and then dra@@ gged out onto the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder of Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could reti@@ re his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old manager was at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully operational &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am fully for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen such a thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up once you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except skir@@ mish ...

soccer : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ der@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus have finally broken down in the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in the du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.@@ 00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot rely on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if R@@ eus will be back in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ match against Le@@ verk@@ usen on Sunday , the BV@@ B coach leaves open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high strain of its professionals , Tu@@ chel will not only change his trunk eleven at the R@@ eus position .
so he announced a change on the door keeper &apos;s position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the seat of gene@@ alo@@ gical novel Br@@ ush@@ ki .
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the world champion .
however , whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in use in all Europe @-@ league games in the future , Tu@@ chel has left open .
with a high probability he will also contest the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ ceful statement by fellow player R@@ eus , that the final campaign for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , mid @-@ field player Julian Wei@@ gl believes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so wrong with Marco . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants leadership role for Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany should be a technological pioneer after the German government &apos;s will to change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the International Motor Show from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and provide less traffic , &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t .
he wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who come together with representatives of the industry at the IAA .
the Strategy Paper of the Ministry of Transport stresses , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band extension and a rapid rise in digital radio communication .
for testing new technology , there is currently a test track on the 9 motorway in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use it internationally for the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only envis@@ ages the human being as a driver .
with automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economics , highly automated driving will be technically possible on motor@@ ways by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , vehicles on public roads are still to be expected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far after 2020 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany is estimated by the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to some 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the security of the personal data of the drivers must be clari@@ fied clearly .
however , the Germans still see self @-@ prop@@ elled cars skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday at the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the@@ ologi@@ an organization Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent expect only 20 years to believe , 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed by 20@@ 25 , with autonomous driving cars , accounting for 33 percent in the United States .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following a survey of the digital network Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the journey across all roads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could at least imagine 15 percent , at the St@@ au 45 percent .
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances to control the car .
Bol@@ l tells team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
according to the current state of the year , the Düsseldorf Congress will only want to hit singles in singles , from 25 September to 4 October .
the final decision is scheduled to fall at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bol@@ l was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ing date in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Single @-@ Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ liste in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo was also ste@@ aling , and we became the European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should focus on this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the World Ranking Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury on the right leg .
at the Champions League game at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , the defender was hit by a tac@@ kling of H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and replaced after a long treatment .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display mannequins , which look terri@@ fying human thanks to video projections .
they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant the Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ak , meanwhile it &apos;s genuine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung from 18 September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer has changed his attitude toward a show of his person at the beginning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ dies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly ever @-@ looking work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is a super@@ bly choreograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which much effort was done : to fr@@ ise the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was especially committed .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have drawn 14 tons of material to Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special treat : a leather trousers outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tiers of old ted@@ dy bears can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , agile fashion attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
playing with a doll , his parents couldn &apos;t have allowed him .
he later taught the dis@@ miss@@ al of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , but of course I bought them .
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they got nothing but could keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of a curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener tip as a fashion niche
earlier it went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and spi@@ kes were produced in great numbers for customers , which they used for example for blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Games P@@ lau@@ en .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewelry , in accessories such as bags and for regional costumes .
at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion that leans against past styles is an increasing order potential .
anyone who doesn &apos;t use any ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
we have already completed half of all orders with us .
P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales were broken .
private specialist shops and wholes@@ al@@ ers are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays the bulk goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively via chains .
in addition , exports are weaker , up to date to Russia and the USA .
so enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score points by environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since that year we have been running a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially endur@@ able . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch of the West@@ sächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
to counter@@ act competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies that need to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why an existing design is often only slightly different in order to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball peak .
at the same time , the machine rocks some small spheres in some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ thing master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired by this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , I couldn &apos;t do anything with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who would like to have a mem@@ ento .
so I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends are not to be touched , but Disney still vent@@ ures into a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a new movie , but a kind of continuation which plays 20 years after the first film with the magic girl girl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about the experience of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the Great Depression in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the director is already firmly : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wide for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy must open broad@@ ly to promote growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group commissioned with the reform of the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should employ foreign investments and know @-@ how to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Board for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; encouraging new start @-@ ups and driving forward reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management group has adopted a number of directives , including a negative list for regulating market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , to record private capital , and over@@ haul the inhabitants of the milking system .
after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment .
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance as it points to the market a major role in allocation of resources , guaranteeing a right @-@ to @-@ law business environment and designed the market more open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transmitted to companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also stated that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas will be opened for private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optimi@@ zing requirements and making the application process easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to guarantee the right of lawyers to exercise their activities , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli attended the meeting , as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury levels in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and to make consumers a significantly higher dose of the nervous system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation Food@@ watch , which has a corresponding working paper in the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force on pregnant women and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Matthias Wolf &apos;s sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogra@@ m of fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic reasons . &quot;
however , large predat@@ ory fish are already so heavily loaded with mercury , that on the basis of the still valid limit values , about 50 percent of the catches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be uns@@ al@@ eable .
in exchange for this e@@ asing , the EU according to Food@@ watch wants to intensi@@ fy the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogra@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Food@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because smaller fish @-@ fish , such as car@@ p , are usually so low @-@ loaded that they already observe the planned maximum values already today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the decrease in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dious distra@@ ction that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal which is highly toxic to humans , which is particularly rich in predat@@ ory fish through the food chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small amounts are particularly able to cause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declares on its homepage with regard to the applicable maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health hazard of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is primarily due to coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written information from the German Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power stations are ej@@ ecting more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish for instance in Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted from the paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish have already been among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
