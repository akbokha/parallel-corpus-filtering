Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing actions in the Middle East .
at the meeting , however , the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed is also to be addressed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and re@@ jects Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal struck by Obama on Iran &apos;s nuclear programme has further worsen@@ ed the relationship between the two .
in March , at the invitation of Republi@@ can Repub@@ lic@@ ans , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech , which was partially regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel was rejected .
in an emergency call , Professor decided to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told a somewhat delicate voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his home .
Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house the officials found the corp@@ se of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note chew@@ ed on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught at two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds where he killed and killed a popular historical professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door of his office , according to the police .
Delta State University Police Chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb has made the fatal cry after@@ ward .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after shooting at the university , the students and instructors forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb would motiv@@ ate .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said that they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time there were some tendencies towards problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for a leave of absence due to health reasons and told that he has any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would not represent a guarantee for an automatic way to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after escap@@ ing from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs &apos; trail when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house approximately one mile south of his parents @-@ house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes he knew the people who lived there .
lamb was growing up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb began his work at the University that has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and education .
he did his doctorate in the spring of pedago@@ gy .
one of the long @-@ time friends of Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar game .
at that time , he was the s@@ warm of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls melt away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and P@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail had both appeared on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he had seen Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss night on the night of September 5th for the last time , after Lamb had ended his guitar and harmon@@ ica pi@@ ce before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no indication that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the clean@@ room and j@@ oked with each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Fr . Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his Brotherhood and the student &apos;s committee .
on Tuesday evening approximately 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commemor@@ ative ceremony .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vi@@ gil , while the &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and Ama@@ zing Grace University sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we are trying to move our students back , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ bor@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect the fact that the police now says that Lamb made the emergency call , after he had shot Schmidt , and that he described Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas time
To@@ ys R Us says that it will not stop as many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said it plan to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers throughout the country . in the Christmas time of 2014 , 45@@ ,000 workers were hired .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees increases from October to December .
while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business is getting closer and businesses are preparing to hire temporary workers to furn@@ ish stores with employees who sell , deliver , and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox is jo@@ king about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat next to me is empty and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film starts and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated thread and a length of arms away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
back in Time , a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had its premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time @-@ travel film ever shot &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be available on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the nearly five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN chief again ur@@ ges all parties , including the shared UN Security Council to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , the UK and France - on the ver@@ ge of meeting the Council of Ministers of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation impossible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban challenged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity with Iran in tac@@ kling the crisis in Syria .
8 survey values that show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the top ranks in surveys , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last 11 national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate fashion .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of which won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but outside groups like J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Tru@@ mp staying power and start letting their dollars flow to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current survey values indicating that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mps En@@ lar@@ gement values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are held in early states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa stated last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two thirds of GO@@ P voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enthusiastic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Tru@@ mp was nominated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they are &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans don &apos;t see Tru@@ mp temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temp@@ er for a president , says ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first pres@@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively execute his office , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament did not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if they expose their side hats , republi@@ can voters stop Tru@@ mp for real .
if they are asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a pol@@ l from CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four of ten say that Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
this is a change since the time four out of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at that time in the final cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination to just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
yet , it is evident that a variety of GO@@ P voters treat the Tru@@ mp campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered for another candidate , Tru@@ mp will beat almost anyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to mp leadership , while the anti @-@ trust support is distributed among more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp is re@@ aping the majority of support .
he has 13 points ahead of C@@ Charlie Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , ahead of J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say they have formed their mind .
a new C@@ BS / NY@@ T survey on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters supporting Tru@@ mp will say they have given their votes .
of course , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change the mind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , Tru@@ mp is the strongest competitor in the moment the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind are twice as common for Tru@@ mp .
six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
since Donald Tru@@ mp was in his election campaign two months ago , immigrants from Mexico called &quot; rapi@@ sts , &quot; the immigration and pi@@ vot@@ al point in the public discourse went to 2016 .
some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will keep key His@@ pan@@ o Americans from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post survey on Monday , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration issues .
so long as the immigration is left in the spotlight , Donald Tru@@ mp apparently will also do it .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs on new high@@ s .
Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son now accounts for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially by their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days @-@ Survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa @-@ Repub@@ lic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated about the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; pol@@ itely angry . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ look@@ en@@ weg you find the most expensive residential complex with a view over the North Sea .
on the street , a square meter of a street roof house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the study - hence the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular locations one square meter is most cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top living places , however , one price is like pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Angel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro ni@@ x - per square meter , well marked .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top of the leader@@ board as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : a dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double Tor@@ schu@@ etz in Pi@@ raeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller gave FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at the Olympic stadium Pi@@ raeus - then it ran .
a sovereign kick @-@ off of the Champions League season .
world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze donated a dream start to the &quot; Milan Mission &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ raeus .
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their inau@@ g@@ ural match in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympics in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9. ) deserved with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth edition success in series is supposed to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola should finally take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
mil@@ ler received kind help from Olympic Stadium go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto in the Champions League for Bavaria leadership in the Champions League for Bavaria leadership , who made a f@@ uss @-@ out shot of the world champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ahm before the match at the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is stadium before 3@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ led word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without shining .
Pi@@ raeus had won his latest six home games in the top class , including prestigious clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) also stum@@ bled .
but the Bav@@ arians , in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went bol@@ dly , but often too resour@@ ceful in their offensive efforts .
the attacks were often initiated by play reloc@@ ation on the left @-@ hand side of Douglas Costa , which rarely came through against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k came from the right half @-@ field in the left upper corner of the door .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion passed the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best opportunities in half .
first of all , as Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ a Brown hit the Pol@@ es head ball from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct debit , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto par@@ ked on his knees ( 35 . 5 ) .
although the Bav@@ arians raised their hab@@ itu@@ al game , Pi@@ raeus could set needle @-@ stick .
but on door@@ keepers Manuel Neu@@ er was leaving .
so about , when he directed a shot of Ide@@ a over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of Neu@@ er , guar@@ ola had to defend a four @-@ chamber with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Uwe Sam@@ mer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to make something different from it is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the killed Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Got@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later , per El@@ f@@ meter Müller continued .
before the game , it was at the stadium in Kra@@ v@@ alle .
after a smaller group of partly pois@@ oned Bayern @-@ fans had apparently prov@@ oked the supporters of host Pi@@ raeus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and attacked the Munich adher@@ ents with striking strokes .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was hurt from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a long @-@ term study of Potsdam .
good news : if there is no risk , the risk drops rapidly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this is due to the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers have the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold .
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
main causes of tooth decay are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ va , accentu@@ ated by the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the link between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear whether smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk in a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment falls back to the level of non @-@ smokers , lau@@ re@@ tor Thomas Dietrich of the English University Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people must convince people to become non @-@ smokers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Head of study H@@ einer Boeing of the DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking will shor@@ ten the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , results in good dental health up to the age of old .
in Germany more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness has been affected by the DI@@ f@@ E .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early dental loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ pins the findings .
archae@@ ologists drive from Cologne &apos;s Rhine shore to remains from the L@@ ate Anti@@ quity
for the ump@@ teenth time , archaeological finds have been made at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
in the vicinity of the building site for the new Rhine Boulevard archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have dug out skel@@ et@@ ons and rem@@ nants of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians have been looking for so @-@ called soil monuments .
for all construction projects in the district of Cologne , the museum is always added to the Department of Archae@@ ological So@@ il Protection .
in the third section of the Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists have now found a wealth of five .
it was already known from text documents that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century had stood a church , Trier explained .
besides the remains of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with approximately 350 graves which probably belonged to the church .
young woman of goods tra@@ cked
after a young woman is displaced at the station in the vul@@ can@@ ic lens , the German police asks the people for help .
on Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 am , the woman crossed the railway station building at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach .
due to the acquisition of the train , it has suffered har@@ dest injuries according to the Federal Police .
she was treated in emergency medical care and brought to hospital by emergency forces .
on the basis of the noc@@ turn@@ al crossing of the young woman , no knowledge is available to the des@@ titu@@ te function@@ aries .

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute on TTIP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to mitig@@ ate the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Free Trade Treaty TTIP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the disputed private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its mode of operation clearly corresponds to more traditional courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de proposed to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
the TTIP aims to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely demonstrate that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should come from the EU , the US and from third countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time , there is also a second instance .
she would allow it to appeal against prejudi@@ ce .
so far the proceedings agreed to each other on arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als , but there was no objection to their jud@@ gements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past few months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Malm@@ ström commented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work towards an international investment court according to its own specifications .
here , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) , especially demanded by large corporations , is regarded as one of the main reasons for the great opposition in Europe to TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice on which companies can strike compensation of the tax@@ pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act received the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate .
it was critici@@ zed above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German Minister for Economic Affairs , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a major advance .
the Commission took into account key points in the reform that the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs of Sig@@ mar Gabriel had worked with other EU trade ministers in spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration was from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the ways of the economy by too many new rules .
in this way , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the talks on the TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
Euro@@ monitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer sustainable .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Prime Club in Cologne ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
beside him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy true folk singer recorded the picturesque US state of Mich@@ igan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he re@@ counts on the basis of various places he always records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they came from and how it looks , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has turned out to be a wonderfully creative Irish .
with the album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; published in 2003 , smart composed songs seem to be clever@@ ly composed , which harmon@@ ically very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can drift into great opul@@ ent moments at any time .
it is rum@@ oured that &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; would be the first part of a dar@@ ing series : each of the 50 states of the states should follow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and in the Rhin@@ eland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already appeared and breaks certain expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
he li@@ stens to his guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician who lives in New York returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) a polished masterpiece appears in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bor@@ rowing ideas and styl@@ istic sophisti@@ cation .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in any annual list of the influential music media .
after extremely productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then relies on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic records .
this sixth resp@@ ectable studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and rever@@ b .
far away from the smaller clubs , the stage shows are here for a colorful spectacle consisting of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring as part of a five member band through Germany .
in the dark @-@ held ham@@ burger mehr !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although almost 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the St@@ ev@@ ens turned back to the in@@ timacy and to the folk .
without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays through the broad @-@ enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you hear from the audience : the talk is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can throw the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate basically away &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gran@@ ces
since his election Mr. Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut will be eag@@ erly awaited by the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gran@@ ces
the new president , Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , will make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gran@@ ces and for the first time he will be working with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask for the first of his six pre@@ defined questions shortly after mid@@ day , and his performance is prob@@ able by the media and the Labour MPs from close quarters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , the decision of the Labour leader on Tuesday prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the centre of several title pages @-@ stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Mr Cor@@ by@@ n spokes@@ man said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they rely on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC , Robin Bran@@ t , says that political differences are also stack@@ ed within Labour , &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitations of winning .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes are setting to remove the whole idea of a limitation overall .
hours later Mr Smith , the Shadow work@@ ing- and pension minister said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against government plans to reduce the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he has been a T@@ ory leader over the Dis@@ patch Box in Parliament last decade .
the Labour leader , who has promised another policy , says that he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s questions are too confron@@ t@@ ational and that he is subjected to both &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; striking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stri@@ fe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and instead focusing on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said Angela Eagle , who is represented by the shadows of the economic ministers , if he does not take part - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also talked about the idea that other colleagues would occasionally grab the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy P@@ unch Theater , &quot; often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s questionnaire . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the prime minister regarded the prime minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and thanks to far @-@ reaching reforms .

the Po@@ und In@@ cre@@ ases by Acc@@ eler@@ ated W@@ age Growth in the United Kingdom
the Po@@ und rose sharply according to data , which indicates an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ B@@ Miller construction target .
between May and July , the result without Bon@@ uses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year .
this percentage had been the fastest since 2009 and resulted in an increase in interest rates .
the Po@@ und rose by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed by 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding stock in the market and made a jump of 20 % after the acquisition of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch together .
after encouraging messages from the competition group for luxury goods , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Ri@@ chem@@ ont &apos;s latest sales figures reflect all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core increased by 5 % after the mining industry said that it took 2.5 billion $ by a stock sales as part of its debt reduction strategy .
the shares of Mon@@ di &apos;s packaging and paper company were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decrease after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his rating for rating &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports clothing company had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages threaten the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster brings Lebanese to the idea of m@@ ashed potatoes
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
it is both - in the Pot@@ ato @-@ ön@@ er , whom Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ h owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
inspired by the phrase &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay Pot@@ el and flesh put together on a sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had acci@@ dentally seen on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , there is a barbecue in his store , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; that &apos;s Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea has now been registered by the Lebanese at the patent office in Munich .
it has recently been protected as a utility model , according to the authorities .
so how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also goes well with his customers .
met@@ ameri@@ can campaign to campaign against al@@ di@@ - collapse
Met@@ amor@@ za tries to protect the I@@ GA branches from an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop@@ keepers who sell approved tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish more details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and devices performs its annual Investor strategy day .
there is much at stake as South Australia and Western Australia accounts for nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA retail outlets and generate higher profit margins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern countries .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley think that Al@@ di will cut about five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of its first markets and will take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath von Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose $ 360 million per year and met@@ ameri@@ can $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year and will generate revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and food business and in the amount of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost approximately 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyer are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2017 , and will reduce market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told at a business dinner in Melbourne that met@@ ameri@@ can is likely to disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to respond publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Mr Dou@@ glass contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ AS market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenue from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food Business , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operational debt reduction at the same time pressure on sales and margins .
however , the wholes@@ aler def@@ ends and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to compare sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ vor@@ oth for hundreds of products each week and to improve their stores with fast growing fresh food and provide a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging rehabilitation programmes will grow at El@@ an and hopes that in 2017 the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ wan and , according to the President of the Australian tennis association , Steve He@@ aly deserves praise as criticism for his own behaviour .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery Quali@@ fication game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon thereafter , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent , R@@ yan Har@@ rison , had to be separated twice by the ump@@ ire , wher@@ eu@@ pon Har@@ rison exc@@ laimed : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka should have sm@@ ashed Kyr@@ gos , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp@@ ing disgu@@ ised a potential US Open win by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m quite anno@@ yed about is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was dra@@ gged a little into the quar@@ rel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I believe he has been treated a bit too severely .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he goes on to the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision not to take account of the important preliminary decision which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term permanent component to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Nick has quickly made the climb what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he climbs in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , in which he can only think about it , I consider appropriate , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares state of emergency , closes the border , considers refugees back &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary declares the state of emergency and sm@@ iled the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to come illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border , when hundreds of migrants trapped in a ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Ser@@ b officials with indignation .
the people who fled from violence thrust at an unknown time in a land stre@@ ak on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations were rising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter above them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opened the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and scre@@ amed insul@@ ts against the Hungarian pro@@ clamation police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some returned from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister declared that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned while more and more came from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days , discussions with Brussels and other countries will have to take place , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a deb@@ atable meeting in Brussels that no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would record further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes for a soon @-@ spe@@ edy action from Brussels or from its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency stand in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities greater powers to cope with the crisis , allowing them to block roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country is planning to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after it has ended a fence along the Serbian border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were deployed in the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the upcoming economic refugees are seeking a better life , and not war refugees that claim protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws which entered into force at midnight in Hungary make crossing the border or damaging the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence built by the government along the southern border with Serbia to a crime . these laws also impose higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern City of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament must still agree to the use of the military expected next week , but Associ@@ ated Press re@@ porters have already seen day @-@ long armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are quick to repair the fence .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train car with bar@@ bed wire had arrived to close the borders .
chaos resh@@ ap@@ ed the most important crossing of the border near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process people &apos;s data and press a crowd to push themselves there .
some 20 succeeded in entering , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national survey hal@@ ved
the former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he presi@@ des for the presi@@ dency , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic elec@@ torate of the prim@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidate they will support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than that of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders posted some gains .
Clinton has a great advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have reduced .
their support for the men has fallen significantly , and S@@ anders only returns with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under the age of 50 has dissip@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
Clinton , however , still has a big margin with the older voters .
last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the democratic elec@@ torate of the local elections say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and further 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current suppor@@ ter is especially enthusiastic about her .
the views are stronger mixed with those who are currently not supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusi@@ astically .
while 48 percent of democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their peak candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
when Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agreement to deal with the problems and the elec@@ tion@@ ability are also cited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Vice @-@ President throws a potential for the presidential office into the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if democratic voters are asked to vote , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than half of Clinton &apos;s followers say that Bi@@ den would be her second choice far ahead of her .
if Bi@@ den decides not to nom@@ inate the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure decreased by 78 percent in the last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important with a candidate , Democratic voters call questions on the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar to last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elec@@ tors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emerged as unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results in some key features among voters in the pre @-@ election of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maj@@ orities view Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
for the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty while Clinton &apos;s strength is the leadership .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have an opinion of him .
democratic voters in the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ideological in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic elec@@ tors have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions regarding H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server during the term as Minister of Foreign Affairs continue to be placed , most of the Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that it has not affected their overall opinions .
but it is another story in the American public as a whole .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their statement , while only about a third is satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the email controversy had no effect on Clinton &apos;s general views , although 36 percent said that their opinion had deterior@@ ated from it .
they are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say their views have become worse from Clinton .
although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered voters . only 32 per cent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 62 percent of voters do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , 55 percent of eligible voters will see Tru@@ mp as not honest and trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp however receive good leadership notes .
from the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best cut off with hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves to Donald Tru@@ mp in a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is on the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tru@@ mp
in the meantime , half of the voters &apos; support in the new pol@@ l is eliminated and others lose dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in large numbers nationwide . support is growing 23 % in the last C@@ BS pol@@ l conducted prior to Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the Tuesday survey .
but Car@@ son shot from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also concluded that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and Tru@@ mp is sur@@ passed among republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated by Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen down from 10 % in the last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are at 6 % in third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey released last week shows that Car@@ son is rising in the p@@ olls - he lands with 19 % support from Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
the latest N@@ BC News / Washington Post survey also clearly showed Tru@@ mp in front of Car@@ son .
looking at a car@@ son rising in the last week , Tru@@ mp found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon himself , even after Car@@ son ap@@ olog@@ ised to question Tru@@ mp &apos;s faith .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday during a campaign appearance in I@@ owa .
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , there is already a trip to the Mediterranean for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers , in order to find even warm water .
a bath in the north or the Baltic may be a rather short pleasure for a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go into the sea : the water in the North and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) informs .
in contrast , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is 25 degrees in peak , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood were charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College no@@ vice
almost two years after a student died during a hi@@ ring ritual of a student association in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , shared the police .
officials said he was bur@@ dened with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i Delta P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was impot@@ ent and supposedly waiting for an hour before bringing him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to switch to D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s clothes , to goo@@ gle his symptoms , and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to seek advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and basically set the Brotherhood &apos;s interest on that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ ohn@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g repeated with bl@@ unt power injuries to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student died every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment due to Mor@@ der &apos;s third degree for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of atro@@ cious attacks and education of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want not only to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold it to account , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the National Brotherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local community .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a interest increase is coming , and the domestic se will be shaking , and returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the history of the economy has little guidance on the exp@@ ir@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ siveness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , albeit not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react .
therefore representatives of the Central Bank have stressed so viol@@ ently that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates but rather to the period needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
however , in the end market participants might find that all excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of a interest increase .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effects .
here is a look at historic trends based on how some areas of the economy might react :
as the market has seen last month , anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there seems to be a tendency for net income from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche @-@ Bank analysts in a more recent study on what is happening after the F@@ ed &apos;s interest increases .
more specifically , the market has been pretty flat in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to increase interest , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal after 500 days , with an average return in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , which published Bob Dol@@ l , Head of Plant Strate@@ ge at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks tends to occur later in the cre@@ asing cycle and the return on investment is beginning to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is facing some conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate a recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is particularly not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a rate increase of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , 118 percent interest rates since 1950 decreased only twice the nominal GDP under 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta F@@ ed , only 1.5 percent expect this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have made an interest rate increase throughout the year , and all eyes were focused on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trading only gives a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all hei@@ gh@@ tening cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sional heights were put into the shadows very quickly after the onset of recovery &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
fixed income was also volati@@ le as the market anticip@@ ates a rate of interest , and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market .
the main difference is that bonds are faster than stocks when they change their strategic course .
in bonds , the returns seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the lif@@ ecycle , the loans cease immediately , said Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to margins between longer and shorter bonds and result in a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ interest bonds often result in better yields in such a climate , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is interesting that Jones thinks the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , bor@@ rowing has expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all the features of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy .
large and large companies that handle the greater part of their business operations in the US will benefit if interest rates increase and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt will be po@@ orer , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market , and also the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial increase in interest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed a weak balance sheet after each of the rate increases 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points on average .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their lower quality counter@@ parts by 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a major problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most , said Gold@@ man .
outside the pure share games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers can see profits from higher yields , even if experts have different opinions about how quickly this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Euro MP Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the channel for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cur@@ v@@ ability &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also referred to the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; a colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins took the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said that this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; into Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading member of Parliament and raises new pressure on the station to prove that he does something that the private sen@@ ders do not do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham even told the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also pointed to the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be only under a different name .
so , if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC Director General rejected the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I &apos;m learning from Radio 3 I won &apos;t learn anything else about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works , I consider really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder should be done to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport to kick off commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory member of Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins picked up The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a special BBC way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wants the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when the next time there is a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other rows of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the pa@@ yers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales rose slow@@ est in August and Black Friday can be held accoun@@ table for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed down the issues
for over a decade , virtual shopping has dri@@ lled , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
but experts say there are signs that online sales are stagn@@ ating after new figures only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with just five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always been developing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the Guardian &apos;s IM@@ R@@ G sales committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that is comm@@ uting , and we may experience that growth is dimin@@ ishing .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the subsequent sales .
experts believe that buyers will keep their purchases from this event , held on the last Friday in November .
last year five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , where buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that out of £ 5 spending a little over £ 1 was spent online .
some products such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines are now being carried out more than one third of their purchases via web shops .
at the same time more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims bury the killed in Mec@@ ca during the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the corp@@ ses of 29 dead are borne by Muslims during the first burial in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia partially cr@@ ushes the collapse of the huge Saudi bin Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that in addition , a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane crashed
hundreds of Muslims assembled when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the dead who were killed when a crane was collap@@ sing in Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mosque .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the way to pay their respect when the first of the dead approached their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ od cemetery .
the procession passed on to the Holy Place where only days before a building crane ran through the ceiling of the mosque and then fell on the bed@@ side .
the bodies were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king compla@@ ined about the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the catastrophe , which also left 3@@ 94 injured .
the corp@@ ses of 29 people who were killed , when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mo@@ sch@@ ee of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane fell down .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ h in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officers have already stated that the p@@ add@@ les will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden group , allegedly did not have the arm of the crane to stop when he was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said the bin Laden group was co @-@ responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the leadership of the company abroad was prohibited .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that r@@ ushed into a courtyard of the grand mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ h , which takes place later this month .
the bin Laden group has not issued statements on the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a comment .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also bl@@ amed the group for not up @-@ to @-@ date security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround the large mosque in Mec@@ ca as part of the massive building project headed by the Bin Laden group .
the bin Laden family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is taking over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an ab@@ dic@@ rous son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s .
the fall of the Cran@@ e came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 15@@ 8 people stay hospit@@ alized .
government representatives ruled that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other wounded will receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European arti@@ sans is over
Brit@@ ons increasingly employ arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe is rising behind
this leads to the opening of 200 more Scre@@ w@@ bu@@ g@@ gers targeting professional tra@@ des@@ people
at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher 60 B &amp; Q will close nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Br@@ its disman@@ tle their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified East European craftsmen who carry out their work in their homes
if you can handle a hammer or brush to paint walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays .
the British are increasingly employing handi@@ craftsmen to carry out DIY jobs in their homes , the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the Bau@@ markt @-@ Chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices has meanwhile been over@@ hau@@ led .
therefore , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops to address professionals and close 60 points of sale of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten buying decisions in the store are met by women .
at the moment , the men predomin@@ ated with the staff .
she said it is necessary to face growing demographic trends that show more female single households that do more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men working in our branches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this to a balance more strongly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also instructed her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that occupies 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the shops .
because of the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; function@@ aries of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ champion A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
he was legally acqu@@ itted by this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , during the preliminary investigation , the accused decided that in 2006 to 2011 , the defend@@ ants used mon@@ ies from the association accounts which they were allowed to dispose of in their functions for private purposes .
it damages the damage with around 400@@ ,000 euros .
sports officials are also accused of financial failure .
this fact was eliminated by the Chairman of the Sho@@ v@@ eller , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
for the off@@ ence of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no time an asset was born to the association .
sports officials could only pay compensation damages and the sports club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money from debt - the liabilities amounted to around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then , we stood before the situation : do we continue or lock the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the defend@@ ants , in the bread@@ basket of the finance department . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his co @-@ accused and co @-@ accused , he then decided to take on this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have made money , our life insurance policies are laid down as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , it is not allowed to pay any debts .
furthermore , in case of a corresponding financial success , the withdrawal of the expense allowance had been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore one part of the expense allowance was paid only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus was on the account .
as a result , all inclusive and not detailed entries appeared , the former Ob@@ server explained the proceedings .
the accounts and accounts were jointly managed by the two accused , the second accused .
why the payments were not disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not care in detail for financial planning , it was important that debt freedom was important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 against the one of the function@@ aries began investigations for office abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these were set@@ backs , the defend@@ ants declared .
this securities account went to the name of the second defend@@ ant and , according to his statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent knew no answer for a long time .
then he finally said that he believed that this was the best for the society .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the public prosec@@ utor pointed to the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claims recovery &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why compensation ? , judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors wanted to know .
the first defend@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association never had any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a lawyer ? &quot; he asked .
furthermore , the vision@@ ary said he had never paid a cent wage , he only charged the mil@@ eage and the di@@ eting .
he added 1,000 euros per month to di@@ eting , but the actual expenditure would have been much higher , he added .
the defend@@ ants were not able to instruc@@ t exact documents for the early years .
they were no longer kept after an audit in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared .
the second defend@@ ant also referred to the kilometre allowance .
in his statement , he explained in his statement that all the deport@@ ations had to be made in cash . he explained in his statement that he had to travel to the bank from his hom@@ etown to the bank .
the trial will be held on 23 September with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard bu@@ ys another 30,000 jobs
in addition to staff cuts running for three years , the computer terri@@ fic will reduce further jobs when spl@@ itting the company .
the positions at the U.S. computer terri@@ fic Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
within the scope of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 positions in its corporate customer segment .
as a result , costs of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company divided on Tuesday .
the move will lead to a special load of some 2.7 billion dollars , which will be incurred from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the Hew@@ lett Packard shares were 2.3 percent after the exchange .
the company , which has grown with printers from the California Pal@@ o Alto , is currently spl@@ itting up : the computer and printer business will be pool@@ ed in a new society - separately from the more promising areas with computer servers and data store for companies as well as other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales , as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers , after its services , were the most recently to the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under EUR 25.@@ 4 billion .
revenues decreased in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP answers with spl@@ itting up and massive positions to change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company headed by Me@@ g Whit@@ man has re@@ acted very late that customers increasingly purchase smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and do more business online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans cover a total of 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would overwhel@@ m the opposition : 54 per cent said , 35 percent agree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that other states fly air@@ strikes against IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , 24 percent agree to intervene in the conflict .
a cooperation with the Syrian authorities Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad with@@ stands 51 percent of respon@@ dents , 20 percent of them would be .
29 per cent were not able to decide .
car : second day of the press at the 6@@ 6th IAA
at the heart of the fair , networked , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electro@@ mobility will be at the centre of the show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after two days of pressing , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mobility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the general public can visit the International Motor Show from Saturday .
as two years ago , the organisers of the Auto @-@ Verband V@@ DA expect some 900 000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : breakdown of violence on Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police fought against several hundred refugees at the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke tear gas and water@@ shed .
Euron@@ ews @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees crossed the border .
behind it a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen a water@@ front was station@@ ed .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials first used Pep@@ per spray un@@ interrup@@ t@@ edly .
afterwards the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn a little bit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant woman , evi@@ dently injured , was removed from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
also the spokes@@ persons of the Serbian police suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world is watching if the US central bank is coming together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade , interest has been raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists asked by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , which was still the last week of view that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates on the current level will be from 0 to 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it is seven years since the F@@ ed interest has been on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , senior employee at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less vag@@ ue outlook on global circumstances .
it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point out that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision shall be announced at 20.@@ 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
Delta State University Todes@@ schüt@@ z bei der Delta State University leaves sorry
after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the Police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , Do@@ cent for Ge@@ ography and Social Science Education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 am Monday morning
and said he had shot on someone and killed someone .
Lamb told the staff of the emergency call center that police officers must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was in the house , but he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller about his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb didn &apos;t give any explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice from Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could reverse it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police surrounded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they were married for about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced fifteen years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed by the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for her daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that P@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
the police said Lamb has called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them that he is not going to jail . &quot;
when polic@@ emen pick him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. in Spring 2015 from Delta State University as his life slip on the University &apos;s website .
stars who have lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ ka@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .
the actor also claimed to fight against drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession .
all of this certainly demands its tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group around the world
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organisation alone .
150 of the 1,000 executives around the world will cost the workplace .
there are however new negotiations with the pilot trade union .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and hon@@ ours the low @-@ cost Euro@@ wings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to earnings of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline divided on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will no longer be managing director for the passenger business in the future .
the low @-@ cost airline Euro@@ wings should be developed as independent as possible .
in the future , in the Management Board of Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings .
with the new setup , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group intends to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
so far , the organisation of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the airlines operated under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the conflict with the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations will be resum@@ ed after the court @-@ led strike on this Thursday .
that divided the union with them .
the theme of the talks shall be the retirement regulation for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a forec@@ asted record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wanted to achieve viable results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and airline has resulted in several strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the interim supply of the pilots , the background is the concept of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it stipul@@ ates that Lufthansa has moved out routes to the Group &apos;s own low @-@ cost airline Euro@@ wings in the fight against competitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; under the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ ning in the South &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; paintings by Le@@ ena Krü@@ ger are to be seen in the Künstler@@ haus . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United cannot play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg in the Manchester United League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brings tears to the left outside defender and is excluded from playing for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w will be able to play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old sha@@ w was burned into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes in the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operated on in Manchester .
it is terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it has very hard and then plays fantastic , and then happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months , and it won &apos;t play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the hanging of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack on both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my path to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
referring to this : Manchester United is suffering the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the loss of PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the England Defender has an additional incentive to recover by the coming June .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , everyone is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a frac@@ ture when Mexico played against Van Go@@ als Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was travelling in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be .
I feel very bad at that . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital after a b@@ oul@@ ding by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron understands The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t be long before you know it almost by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a child care system provider to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Minister @-@ President ruled for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental fasting person published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , because it always seems to give an image or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron re@@ port@@ edly describes the story of the book , instead returns an ingredient of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text .
&quot; in the middle of the walled city of Th@@ in @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; he reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if this was not yet suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly read as the summary of the Lor@@ ax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to being a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ b@@ able that Cameron is so little familiar to the story of the book . here an un@@ named boy hears , how the local environment is rav@@ aged by the cov@@ eted lor@@ ry , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , snow@@ y creature that speaks in the name of the trees .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times consec@@ u@@ tively to a child .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text was probably come from Cameron &apos;s constitu@@ ency office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but gave no immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when you see the cad@@ re who has chosen England for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not exclude a 1 @-@ 2 victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batch setting , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear s@@ cars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack .
this message : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to om@@ it Adam Ly@@ th is of course hard to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
in his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are aligned to results .
there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination because - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
a long time ago , the run of Ly@@ th would have been extended , but he had control of his own fate .
if he hopefully turns out further sales for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there will be another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and out .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first deployed Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he &apos;s a drummer that I highly value .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he achieved 2@@ 36 points against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge Square , which we met very much .
he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but of course this depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of letting Mo@@ een apart from Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bowl and get four squ@@ e@@ cks appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this lef@@ th@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my previous team mate Justi@@ n Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he opened as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made straight three hundred rounds immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes to the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him , he was very impressed by me as a young man .
people may see their statistics - average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spins , which raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some wise additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experience , as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful application into the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ lah he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices in the locker room can bring fresh wind , even if the messages are in accordance with the previously mentioned .
Coll@@ ey &apos;s te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken lightly .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Great Britain from the EU ) could gain access if the economy gets into a l@@ ull by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ postpon@@ able ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper every day , even without the choice of the ingeni@@ ous Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who viol@@ ated Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners have also their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at friend recently said that some member states are so deeply involved in various crises such as the EU is and not always of their own guilt , Britain &apos;s own agenda with broken concessions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they mostly do not want to be sati@@ ated .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance climb to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s all about me .
my European friend , who wants to look outside the UK inside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come up to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious German Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it has happened in the exagger@@ ated long @-@ ending such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande faces his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
it is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left one .
it is hard to imagine that they will get a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers might even intentionally not plan helpful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , during the UK &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has gained nothing of value from ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press one , as they were not during the 1975 referendum , inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , that supported our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they may remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro Opport@@ uni@@ sts , who made himself a name as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing ch@@ ur@@ ks , telephone chips foreigners and pseudo @-@ non @-@ foreigners , most of our major newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about them , but pointed out that when one sits in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , one better distri@@ butes ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him rather than to become his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more a Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s refer@@ endu@@ ms , as Bla@@ ir had put the principle behind the un@@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press has never betra@@ yed him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly brand@@ y on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me to waste - seems at risk to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 &apos;s , a mistake then and today .
it can last but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position in Europe is - I simply express it - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff @-@ Ten@@ dency and the wild bo@@ ilers of Tor@@ ey &apos;s Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ismus can probably say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary said &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said that the sc@@ outs in him fought , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ nell as a shadow Chancellor was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be il@@ legitimate towards his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ary &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and dep@@ uties after all reports on their Monday evening on Monday evening .
whatever the sc@@ ary bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News @-@ discipline remains important in the era of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it &apos;s right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ nell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins surely thinks like this .
but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s basic ambig@@ ui@@ ties regarding the EU membership - in line with their Gordon Siege Economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for whom the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic arguments .
as with its ambig@@ ui@@ ties regarding Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign for leaving - foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions to the British when all this can be sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
the US has already been quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of at the start on Monday , what was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health UK report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 persons , some with compounds to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined the Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
P@@ he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptionally wind@@ y foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the alle@@ gations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said the public expected that the claim of P@@ he that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to bring their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received from British American Tob@@ acco Dru@@ ms ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also under@@ wrote references from BA@@ T to Public Health in a Sustainability Report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to have received after reports by the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International .
the reasons for selecting members of the board are not provided , but there are several well @-@ known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco management of P@@ he took part in the meeting .
the group &apos;s research work is marked by a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products in most criteria , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims of P@@ he that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence so far that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; premature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J has already responded to the claims of BM@@ J .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
almost 80@@ ,000 people annually die from a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by explaining current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ on , says former head of Channel 4
the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ er- and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square soap .
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK channels .
he critici@@ zed the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs likely to be seen by a smaller audience in a hard @-@ cont@@ ested period of time against the most popular shows of its ri@@ vals and by broad@@ cast@@ ers such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that for six years in his time at Channel 4 he tried to get in touch with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the wa@@ iter @-@ house communication committee in his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the radio fee , which I do not think in the medium or long term for a good idea , you should at least give your production to programs that others do not do or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to reach as wide a support as possible for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax would be financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ ender is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I am trying to see how this is to be public broadcasting .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s fault in the hunt for reviews is &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular programmes of the BBC shows what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows how East@@ ward should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal ni@@ ches should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 where rather the audience cannot compete , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue when they go to their hypo@@ critical missions to justify 4 billion pounds of broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course you all think we all think that you get a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who are for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if that is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; former Sky@@ liner and Channel 5 leader David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , urged the BBC to review its Rei@@ chen@@ an mission to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educ@@ ate , train and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0,1 % on radio - and it should take an example on the public @-@ legal channels in Australia and Canada , &quot; inform , enligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain . &quot;
on the question of partnerships El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful are shown on television , and with the commercial broad@@ caster Alli@@ ances go in to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change direction at the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound stimul@@ i .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment when they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound stimul@@ i that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultras@@ onic waves .
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ Genetics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace deep brain stimulation , a invasive procedure that gives electric impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
gour@@ mets normally do not respond to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic air bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applied ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro bubbles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the modified mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which must be sent down to the desired place in the brain by optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily disable the targeted human neur@@ ons for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

the 300 posters are of artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of cruel designs in Bank@@ sys D@@ ism@@ aland .
a collective named Special Pat@@ rol Group helped in the distribution in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a 6 @-@ to @-@ pack of bus keys claiming that &quot; access to around one @-@ third of the bus stop advertising spaces on the planet . &quot;

according to Gav@@ in Gr@@ ind@@ on , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol Designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists will become critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside galleries .
many artists turn to work with activists within protest movements and realize that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an impact on society .
another of the anti @-@ arms trade posters will greet commuters in the subway .

&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the ce@@ ase@@ fire - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic corporate advertisement , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ ep@@ r@@ ints with bright colors and animation , it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the trade show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is a progress in the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally at our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair comes from the area inside Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors are f@@ ading fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student resi@@ dences
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anger@@ ed - and the numerous , long @-@ lasting complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the entry into student resi@@ dences ranges from slightly annoying to absolutely sc@@ ary .
it is temp@@ ting to chat : people tell where you come from , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ax , where you stand in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly say Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in serious , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those you wouldn &apos;t talk with even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and those fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people .
people often turn into drinks reception , movie night venues and communal meeting points , but they are also the places where people dress up and put down their under@@ wear .
referring to this : do not remember to start with a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted will receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ room bum@@ ble culture that can be friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos refu@@ eling : do it .
a guy in my student residence halls had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship through baking .
since you begin the university at the height of the back man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate full of Brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I &apos;ve made you something . so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are an independent b@@ aker .
poorly mixed cl@@ um@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check that with the dairy owner .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves , even when they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced as my room@@ mate who added a washing liquid to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people sitting in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb .
a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbors , if it makes them something to make Drum &amp; Bass a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had an examination in the morning .
they re@@ acted with even more tep@@ id music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly left her neighbours to sleep two hours before leaving her own music , shut down her door and went to her three hour examination .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would be random@@ ly entering the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be aw@@ k@@ ward embarrass@@ ing if you keep an room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , take care of them , separate yourself and see them every day and maybe see how she passes all together friends ?
of course , the heart goes his own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to persu@@ ade your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has left his keys in his un@@ locked room , the border between an Ul@@ k and mo@@ bbing is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good stroke is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give a valuable and am@@ using lesson through hiding , but never neglect someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water that you then put in the freezer - but don &apos;t shake their possessions on the ceiling more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single @-@ educ@@ ators , Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ dur@@ ans
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner grows town@@ houses in central Fran@@ con@@ ia for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example for refugees , but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living room , but also the single mother and the low @-@ ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build even today cheap and well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly a convenient housing can be created : he builds town@@ houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gymn@@ asi@@ ums has no sustainability .
for the people remain a big part here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the stream of refugees , we also need sufficient space in the coming decades . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very ban@@ al three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a terra@@ ced house needs least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different when the people are accommodated in blocks of flats .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seekers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
how much is the cost ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 18@@ 4 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I went through my project correctly .
especially complicated it always makes the threatening Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ dig special construction and the Stell@@ platz@@ l ordin@@ ance .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still under@@ lined , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is no room for that .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their Rei@@ h@@ enhaus project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
which definitely is not right .
but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate competition for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true is it : we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but these are luxury apartments that hardly can afford more .
my project has the message , even ordinary people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the single mother or the ear@@ ner .
I &apos;ll show you how to build good and cheap today .
that is what it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , typing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it &apos;s ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , because they receive an error message telling that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update is missing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to circum@@ vent the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it impro@@ b@@ able by stream@@ lining the update . similarly , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue because the phone may switch to half way and this may lead to a demo@@ lition of the update .

district office looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the &quot; Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft &quot; have joined forces under the clo@@ ak of the Social Foundation and opened a new focal point at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
apart from consultations you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain into the inner city .
more specifically to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , directly next to the shopping market , you will receive sen@@ iors and advice from now on questions such as the care insurance or the services of the health and nursing staff .
for years , we have been working with our ambul@@ atory nursing staff that often nursing relatives are left alone .
there are so many questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not seldom use many services of the insurance companies because the complexity of insurance companies is hardly understood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained the new house@@ keeper Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the civil hospital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consulting , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this the sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as fall prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapy treatment can be used .
the offers from the retirement Centre and the Sal@@ u@@ di complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prev@@ ent@@ ative care and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the retirement Centre for Care and Care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is seen by both executives especially in demographic change .
because this makes a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure in the individual parts of the city of Bam@@ berg essential in the future .
in addition , as mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined at the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the association in old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ alizing community . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a big contribution , that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well in their familiar environment as possible .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m .

men beating about 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 hrs , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 @-@ year old Afghan , according to the police , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this point the group was at the height of the b@@ ft fuel station .
three people were also on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men shou@@ ted to the young man and struck him with his fist on his face .
the victim suffered a nose @-@ bone rup@@ ture and bleeding heavily out of the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the rac@@ quet , he first let off his victim .
the wounded young man was brought home from his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator persecuted the group with a passenger car to their apartment and drove past there demonstr@@ atively several times .
when one no longer saw the vehicle , the injured went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
with the aid of a stroke , one checked on the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
so far only a vag@@ ue work description is available .
one of the men was about 1,80 meters tall .
the second ra@@ cket was about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ aus .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert also look forward to this .
in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing luck : on 1 October Dr Frank Müller will take over the practice field breaks .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ is@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich will be on the side of his successor in the coming months .
after a reconstruction phase Müller will open the practice on 12 October , until then he will invest 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when Frank Müller and his wife had met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll who are currently doing their vocational training at the Ver@@ den Hospital and who will also get into practice in the coming year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ aus and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was time I just called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mul@@ ler pleased the idea of running his own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old mil@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage he also seems to be his own boss .
and so it was agreed that the mil@@ ler bought the house with the practice .
meanwhile , they will continue to live in hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there , the two @-@ time family @-@ father Frank Müller grew up , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed chief physician in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved in voluntary work in the DRC &apos;s prepar@@ edness in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19 the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is working as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) has specialized in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mil@@ ler , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as a family doctor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the endos@@ copy comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the renovation , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a talk room .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a subsi@@ dy of a total of 50,000 euros is given by the mil@@ ler as part of a subsi@@ dy programme of the administrative district ( 25,000 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes Sam@@ t@@ commun@@ i meister Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ au every quarter of 2000 patients come to the practice field breaks , in the north German average practice they are about 500 .
there is another medical practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the practice takeover by Frank Müller : according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ aus in A@@ sen@@ dorf , the pharmacy remains .
if no follow@@ er had found herself , she would have gone .
anyone who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation hour , by the way , continues to look at familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms .
their par@@ ting ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the doctors have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; says Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ aus , smiling .
a little melanchol@@ y she already felt after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I &apos;ve always pressed myself against gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we let the refugees pass through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also lifted up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still clear that anyone wanting to submit a asylum claim can also do so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the focus is on the health and safety of people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also clear that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia is considering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; corridor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Slovenia refused &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Croatian government had previously announced that even Slovenia would leave the refugees arriving in Austria and Germany , and in some cases er@@ ect cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the Minister of Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ z Z@@ ni@@ dar however did not see this in Lai@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ian does not want to limit its borders for refugees but not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ z Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours to arrive in eastern Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration .
the Croatian police was able to pick them up in the near corn fields .
since then , according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees arrive in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is primarily a matter of Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country reck@@ oned with about 4,000 refugees , Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ z@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which previously led migrants to the Hungarian border , would re@@ port@@ edly re@@ port@@ edly re@@ port@@ edly reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade fought , however , that it was to instruc@@ t people to beat certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do so , &quot; he said .
according to media reports , in the morning a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day more buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the road all night long from the Mac@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border which was about 500 kilometers away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could indeed lead to a postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a further west @-@ located route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country has prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional circumstances in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not refer to details , but pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently delivered the country a good testimony concerning the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked .
whether the remaining refugees will now continue to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Minister of Interior , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic , tried to calm him at a local eye in Hor@@ gos at an early age : he kept the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be about very high refugee numbers at this time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not possible to say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun distributing land cards to the refugees on which alternative routes through Croatia are drawn .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .

in this way , according to the investig@@ ators , a total of over 100 million dollars were launched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C . &quot; &quot; &quot;

ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz there is a busy operation .

they are steering the two stations of the Mannheim Aut@@ os@@ al@@ ons at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep track of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; puls@@ ating , boun@@ tiful life with wonderful autumn sunshine and mitt@@ en@@ drin four big boards each with the heading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Before I die I want to die &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this action , E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce was attentive to its 20 @-@ year existence and is certainly confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce assistance is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as questions and conversations as well as volunteers .
while some pass@@ ant spontaneously sei@@ zes the chal@@ k and affir@@ ms the sentence &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; not suffer long &quot; , others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then proceed .
again and again small discussions about the action itself develop on the ver@@ ge of life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only when I realize that at some point the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the di@@ ak@@ on@@ ical work Mannheim , which is jointly with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ union supporting the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service .
therefore this public @-@ effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
the fact that not everyone is willing to publicly announce themselves on the panels is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .
the issue of death and dying is still cl@@ inging to tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening up of people .
an app@@ rais@@ al that An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ ander shares .
the minister of ster@@ ling and mour@@ ning belongs to the volunteer staff of the first hour .
confronted with personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in the eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid was looking for volunteers by calling for volunteers , she immediately reported and was part of the foundation in 1995 .
a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - is accompanied by relatives and relatives in private homes , hospitals , nursing homes , and Hos@@ pi@@ ce St. Vincent .
they are all well trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ de@@ mir is able to cope well with her duties and experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another point , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ atory E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and non @-@ con@@ fession@@ al .
the financial support of health insurance funds and donations from relatives and associations enables training as well as training and supervision of the death and mour@@ ning atten@@ d@@ ants .
training for new employees is offered every two years .
the panels described on Saturday are now on display in the House of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .
also there other personal wishes on post@@ cards can be recorded .

the share fell by 2.5 percent in pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said earning a gain of $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in fiscal year that will end in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in earlier pre@@ diction .
analysts predicted , according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower level of view , despite the price increases , will be 4.@@ 9 percent on average and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher bo@@ d@@ ship transports of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said it is still expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to lower costs , higher revenues and growth in online trading . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delivers solid earnings when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for holiday occup@@ ations were announced one day later as the rival U@@ PS , who plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , roughly the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which predicted the twelve analysts asked by Z@@ ack Investment Research .
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion dollars .
six analysts sur@@ vey@@ ed analysts predicted $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international pri@@ ori@@ tis@@ ation shipping , which brought sales in its unit express shipping to stagn@@ ate .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex ground .
in the last quarter , sales in the body transport increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express Unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices while the result was lower due to higher labour costs in the cargo business .
in the pre@@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares sank by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .

at its most anticipated meeting in the year Federal Reserve Strate@@ gen spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to lift the Lei@@ tz@@ in for the first time for almost a decade .
lo@@ oming above them at one end of the orn@@ ate two @-@ story cour@@ tro@@ om is a mur@@ al from the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double mandate from Congress : maxim@@ izing US occupation and prices here stable .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday that the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented incentive by the close @-@ to @-@ zero interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the economic data show that it is growing solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in global financial markets could make the already @-@ si@@ ghted F@@ ed representatives afraid to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal securities - and be it just a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing to observe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text not to increase the interest rate , the increased in@@ security around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which dis@@ sec@@ ures the financial market itself .
about half of econom@@ ists who were recently sur@@ vey@@ ed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted interest increase this week .
however , the financial markets expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator showing only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this suggests a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mitig@@ ate the impact by promising another increase far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ sky , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that point , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , she would have to go very far in her declaration to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a interest increase would re@@ assure the financial markets , because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed good ways to increase the rate by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the liber@@ als &quot; complaints that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the sentence was expected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unemployment rate declined to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed considers full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was continually below the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can deal with higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist of Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world picked up at the end of last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Value dropped by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that the Chinese economy slow@@ ed down global growth .
the market recovered slightly this month , with the Dow now being nearly 10 % below the peak of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market tur@@ mo@@ il influences complex calculation when one should increase interest rates .
&quot; if events in the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy have not occurred in the past few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former US staff member .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to better get a grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the effects on the US economy , and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the global economy is not the main concern of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in its decision @-@ making process .
but in the end the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
the mere reference of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke , in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow down its monetary expansion , &quot; triggered confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect them not only to monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for We@@ alth Management , En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of re@@ perc@@ ussions on financial market movements that seem not to be associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ ner , refer@@ enced member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which advoc@@ ates interest increase , made decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its incidence by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited recognis@@ able effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lack@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market re@@ unification , &quot; said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il does not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a interest increase because the markets energi@@ ze , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed I don &apos;t think it should hurry ahead .
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yes , Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little Assistance for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome , do not work without the commitment of innumerable volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
they include Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach with her 74 conferences .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seek@@ er at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
there they help refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , this is quite different teaching than at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric association Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organisation SP@@ RS tries to enligh@@ ten women on how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of images of babies that are su@@ cking to breasts that are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build up a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by approximately 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should undertake .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ors .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child may adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Am@@ rie@@ der Sports Hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atten@@ ed for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awaited gymn@@ asi@@ um building on the Bern@@ ina sports grounds move step by step : in the latest municipal meeting , the completed construction work was unanim@@ ously approved without great discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; prior to that , the Board had , among other things , adopted an application for a construc@@ tional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resp@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the valid plan of cultivation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was permission for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ containing first and roof over@@ hang &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the planning is the intended use of the roof area for solar systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliver@@ ance &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it was again about the roof inclin@@ ation , which should lie under ten degrees for energetic reasons - unlike in the construction plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the construction plan permits no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the roof tilt , whereby the Bern@@ ina municipal council generally is rather restric@@ tive in the case of liber@@ ating contracts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the turn@@ around is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
the costs are EUR 2.3 million .
subsidies are expected from school and grass@@ roots sports .
in the next step , the proposal for the 18 x 36 meter hall will now be submitted to the Land@@ rats@@ amt ( Land@@ rats@@ amt ) .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will become the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of staff move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county , which confirmed the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
however , a decision about this is the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , 23 September .
if plans were to be implemented , then all of the 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would continue to work .
the vast majority should be moved to Sch@@ ong@@ au by fishermen and the existing internal station .
the rooms are available .
employees who do not have to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered at Wei@@ l@@ heim a workplace , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss .
the staff will be informed about the plans .
the change was initiated by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
on the question of who should be followed , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead on October 1 and to change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this was in any case a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a dis@@ semination of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inside .
for the next two years , Fischer and his team will , if the Supervisory Board appro@@ ves that both houses will lead , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ el , which still has 35 beds , is to be defini@@ tively closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital has been completed .
Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met with rum@@ ors that the House , owned by the federal government , should be used as an accommodation for asylum @-@ seekers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll close it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a day@@ was@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer on the quasi @-@ reloc@@ ation to the Le@@ ch , who had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positively and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no real prospect for the house where fishermen worked as chief physician for over 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ au &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the Medical Director .
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital ( once 100 beds ) has repeatedly been threatened with closure in recent decades , departments have been closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .

a suspect has led the police to the corp@@ se of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday .
at the inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people killed and threw their corp@@ ses into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has been missing a victim of violence since Saturday .
the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , like the public prosec@@ utor and the police on Wednesday .
an active 20 @-@ year @-@ old is also considered to be active on Tuesday evening , according to the statement that the investig@@ ators lead to the discovery site of the corp@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen had not arrived at home on the eve of an autumn festival .
in search of the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the case of interviews in the circle of friends and acquaintances , a crime was finally found against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the corp@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee admitted to the police station to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the bodies in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put a total charge on him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisions on the closer circumstances of action are meant to bring further investigations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for affordable ble@@ aching .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
with the incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people push for a market that is already stra@@ ined in many large cities .
they compete with low income citizens around the last affordable housing .
to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the Con@@ federation Deb@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social H@@ ousing Construction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison : in Germany , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished this year .
there@@ with there are 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings .
refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation after the first three months of their stay .
many come across the housing market and are lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , in the last year , however , less than half of all asylum seekers were charged .
the negative development of the housing market , however , is not only due to the increasing number of refugees .
the study also makes considerable om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany is shooting an housing deficit that will grow from year to year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently , some 77@@ ,000 residential units have already been missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many working people therefore lived in large cities necessarily in shared rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults were staying longer in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the loud noise on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in large cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has been declining for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sozial@@ er housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new incentives should boost social housing construction .
thus , the Real Estate Purch@@ ase Tax can be dispens@@ ed with and the land tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats may be suspended .
in addition , according to the alliance , attractive tax amor@@ tis@@ ation possibilities are necessary .
the supporting programme for refugee accomod@@ ations at Kf@@ W State Bank is already well received by towns and communities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available around 300 million euros have already been rec@@ alled on Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free access : Croatia and Slovenia cause corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is practically no passage to Hungary , as more refugees choose the way to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb An@@ no@@ un@@ ces to grant transit across Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia via the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have spoken to the Sloven@@ ian Minister of Interior , and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the expul@@ sion of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports Croatian TV broad@@ caster RT@@ L .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the day before . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new laws that entered into force on the same day make regular asylum procedures in Hungary superf@@ lu@@ ous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia wants to let the refugees pass . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can go through and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
but there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian police took up the first refugees at the border of Serbia in the morning to the EU neighbouring country in Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of the media reports are reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came to the Serbian border town of S@@ id both by bus and taxis .
immediately upon arrival , they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not reach a fence .
that is why the border strip shel@@ ters other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , after the closure of the border , there are hardly any refugees coming to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 people attacked .
shortly before closing on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws grades the overcoming and damage of the border zone as a crime .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in Sz@@ eg@@ ed , Hungary .
the convic@@ ted threaten prison sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications have been received on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; transit zones , &quot; of which almost all - 93 - at the most important crossing of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees detained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; practically no one has a prospect of granting asylum in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; before the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Trans@@ car@@ one &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees gathered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they gathered the rub@@ b@@ ish that had left tens of thousands of people in the past weeks at the road@@ side .
shut@@ ters were disman@@ tled and one of the host camps in the border town was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express itself to the goal of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria reached only a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
however , about 20,000 migrants were still in the country after government declarations .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped at the command of German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees met on a regular basis .
mayor was driving &quot; str@@ anded &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the bridge festival on Sunday we were busy with clearing up when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to take the train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly set the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the stream of refugees , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein concluded , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the borders together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars crossed the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we first tasted the unexpected guests , with snacks and drinks .
we said the same , we take it by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N talk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself be given a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that made us very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from an ICE train to Passa@@ u on Sunday evening in W@@ els , after the announcement that the rail transport to Germany was stopped , but still to try to cross the border .
but the regional train was stopped at the Inn in front of the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , day before a two @-@ b@@ ump @-@ run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends another tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately in the establishment of structures that guarantee humanity , our Federal Chancellor has officially and publicly tra@@ cked the attitude of the Hungarian government into the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dun@@ st@@ circle of National Socialism &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the border regions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to state that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which she has invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge in the face of the ongoing stream of refugees and the approaching winter to produce decent conditions for protection @-@ seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof lod@@ gings
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad has all hands to do with the spreading of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen @-@ bank@@ ers to introduce lod@@ gings for the thousands of refugees .
Konrad has already gotten a grip on the chaos in the former Tra@@ is@@ kirchen education centre .
&quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he told of his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the placing of the 20,000 refugees that came to Austria on Monday was carried out without a big whi@@ rl@@ wind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Con@@ rad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; masterpiece &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad expects a demand of 85@@ ,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ ary year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings must be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15,000 of the Con@@ federation .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Con@@ rad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial capitals .
these would have assured him of creating quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things are going well in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ate supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , thereby clari@@ fied how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum @-@ coordinator puts great expectations into the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping as we do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodations .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter .
yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of emergency , it cannot be that district employers have to respect a certain amount of towel holder or size of the duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a limited period of time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad with his experience founded Konrad with his experience that he is more successful in terms of accommodation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom you don &apos;t say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier are not responsible for the Republic as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their head@@ count to three to four .
the company &apos;s own district search has not been successful until now .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for better distribution
for now no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for accommodating refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as the persons affected can currently be accommodated without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further sites are to be tested for their suitability .
the mayor has critic@@ ised the division of the refugees within the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; boundaries are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , the Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) agreed on further action in the refugee issue on Monday .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
the transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany .
however , the seek@@ er @-@ seekers would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that Austria , too , will once again introduce checks on its borders is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger from the German approach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the listed IT Group S &amp; T is set in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the rest ( 27@@ 00 sq@@ .@@ m. ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , the smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in startup companies in the Neue Wer@@ ft , and later on to acquire them .
from the very start S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises something : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
EUR 1.7 million has been invested by S &amp; T in its location , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which is one @-@ third of the city of Linz , the Land of Upper Austria and the Federal Government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center from Linz AG for 60 years .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the arcade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la Hand@@ bags .
actually Jutta had wanted to get a dog .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she has now acquired an increase in the form of a further business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the store , in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long wondered if I should still open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of a location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the large space Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has brought birth from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I am most surprised when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women look at a hand@@ bag when looking at a hand@@ bag , the professional lady cannot answer with last certainty .
maybe it &apos;s because a beautiful bag is evaluating any outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are named An@@ ders .
some people also associate this property with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
whether it mani@@ f@@ ests itself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , journalists touch@@ down or revealing knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. presi@@ dency is power@@ ing vigor@@ ously for the election campaign .
and cuts off well .
this is also recorded in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fo@@ eh@@ fres@@ hen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term many in the wine @-@ growing village on the wine road . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ place is related to him over ump@@ teen corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in the election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del made a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous shoots , among which beside Tru@@ mp also the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz ranks .
Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also speaks a word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the King of the hearts there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , however , the opinion that Tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is already a bit of a big mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the per@@ imeter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in High German : the investors , they say . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the investors .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the foundations of the real estate group were first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their home in the long run failed in the Bavarian state to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged to that time .
the director of the Institute for pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Geschichte und Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared for the start of the film .
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an illegal immig@@ rant .
this contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descendants .
he had repeatedly argued against Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tru@@ mp ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The grand@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the retired wine maker clearly distances the Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so explosive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
Pen@@ sion@@ sk@@ ie Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm mentioned like some K@@ all@@ stadt , that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which was generally good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that of Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they find it better if he won &apos;t win the election because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if those who had the sa@@ ws at the time of his grandfather in the United States would have been like him , &quot; he would have never been there . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ eg@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ri@@ pen@@ ed without President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tru@@ mp was inter@@ viewed for a long time , saw 12@@ ,000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , also in the United States awak@@ ens the interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavarian commune Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain@@ eering village . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants of the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for Sustainable Tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain@@ eering goo@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have at most 2,500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite the attempts of N@@ ine to take over leadership in the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of leadership in the liber@@ als , but there have been no major shifts in the Today reviews .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broadcast by the state capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull won the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Ri@@ val Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , stuck in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the distance seemed to play no part for Australian TV viewers , as Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 spectators in the five major cities , compared to today &apos;s 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , Today , a slight increase in ratings on Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number fell behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , Today , Today , the gap to Sun@@ rise was closed in recent months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August , Today , on average 3@@ 18@@ ,000 reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 3@@ 50,000 Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance ran between 40,000 and 50,000 .
up until now , Sun@@ rise has an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators up to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect this morning man more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the ex @-@ series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a newly weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics have wondered whether Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ter Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million spectators and easily hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL fam@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 5 : 00 p.m. to 5 : 30 p.m. ) of the new qui@@ z show presented by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored an average of 44@@ 6.000 visitors .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia generated 5@@ 20,000 spectators and during the second half an hour he finished 7@@ 20,000 .
hot Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the ratings of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 p.m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that failed to over@@ ride the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three matches are in line : b@@ achel@@ or Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secrets unveiled ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor .
the woman who finally lands Sam Wood into The Bachelor has been sh@@ rou@@ ded in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who has received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before coming from three , you may acci@@ dentally have given a clu@@ e about who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips locked until the final on th@@ urs@@ day
all three women have been ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked , &quot; If you don &apos;t , who should receive W@@ oods Last Rose ? , &quot; their answers could become a game destro@@ yer who won the heart of the b@@ achel@@ or .
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki quickly named both - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and re@@ marked S@@ ams &apos;s energies , I sen@@ sed that they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on @-@ Fel@@ lows .
Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood are well suited as a pair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home visit last week made her clear that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the One &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly set on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls alike - it &apos;s a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the b@@ achel@@ or will be broad@@ cast@@ ed on ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests for his impressive open training day late last year .
but Hay@@ nes chose San Francisco &apos;s 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some coaches would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ key as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ ver@@ ting on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his man and gave Hay@@ nes the next opportunity to get a pun@@ t @-@ return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
in his press conference , Tom@@ sul@@ a also publicly supported Hay@@ ne during his press conference .
the 49@@ ers sports re@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by specialist team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his scra@@ pped catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t , which was restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start which Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian band had hoped for for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the fi@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy to 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a bad start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens , you only take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut at that time in 2007 when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn break in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ van@@ ger warned of a severe crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools when there are not new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse , &quot; Ai@@ van@@ ger said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get off@@ ences in the Bavarian educational system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Free Elec@@ toral Day Ques@@ tion was held until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
actually there were completely different main themes .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the free voters &apos; meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the topic of asylum will over@@ lay the retreat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ cha . &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ ï@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN shel@@ ters for refugees in Syria , just as she gave during the Yugosla@@ v Wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one Free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts that are responsible for asylum seekers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ van@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards of federal states throughout Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria push@@ es off , others don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the country politics should not fall under the table in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt .
a long lasting hit is on the agenda : education policy .
for the new school year , German Minister of Education Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; Mittel@@ stufe Deutsch , &quot; which will be extended from three to four years .
but this is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W Chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all high schools wanting to do so .
free travel at G@@ 9 anywhere where it is desired .
fortress Wall Street helps D@@ ax jump on le@@ aps
the German stock market has concluded with profits following an extensive and nervous trading course .
only in the afternoon saw a stronger start of the US stock exchanges for a clear direction which ultimately promoted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points .
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized values gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2.@@ 88 points .

the Euro@@ Sto@@ xx 50 as the index of the euro zone fell by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points .
solid profits also earned the London and Paris trading places .
in the United States , the Dow Jones Index last recorded some 1 percent plus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many stock markets expect the markets to take place until after the US interest rate and also for the large decline on the fut@@ ures on this Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the meantime , the discussion about the burdens arising from the nuclear phase has pushed the shares of RW@@ E to a record low in the meantime and left its mark on E@@ on &apos;s deep traces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros for provisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Government denied the figures cited in the press .
the shares of the two largest German energy companies subsequently recovered , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
at the D@@ ax peak , Infin@@ eon shares increased by a further 3.@@ 22 percent .
according to a tra@@ der , a positive account of the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; had a positive impact on the weekend .
accordingly , investors are currently too little attention to the German chip@@ maker .
investment in future @-@ oriented waf@@ er technologies and the focus should be paid to the car market .
car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August more cars were set off than in the same period of the previous year , as the AC@@ EA industry association announced at the start of the International Motor Show in Frankfurt .
the papers of the Daimler and BMW car manufacturers increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen &apos;s assets accounted for 1.@@ 26 percent .
on the German pension market , return on return of listed German securities was reduced to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent .
the Re@@ x pension index rose by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the federal government lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
the course of the euro sank in the afternoon to 1.@@ 12@@ 62 dollars .
at mid@@ day the European Central Bank had set the reference rate to 1.@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1.@@ 12@@ 68 ) US dollars .

4 killed after polic@@ emen shot rubber bul@@ lets on prot@@ esters in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets into a crowd of people demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ stretch district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , leading district administrator , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside of a police station , with some of them throwing stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police had used tear gas and then shot into the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used , of which it is known that they can kill , which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high rate of death .
the conflict was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ ri@@ ans say that new provinces that are formed within the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in the western Nepal by the ethnic group of the T@@ arus , who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent disputes since the 10th century .
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal that has been governed centrally for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ators ha@@ sten@@ ed the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legislature voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the grounds at Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post are to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 m ² area .
a mix of trade , trade and housing is planned - but there are no specific offers yet .
Em@@ den - Em@@ den wants to market a plot of approximately 4,000 square meters in direct proximity to the Old Post Youth Centre .
the preparations for this are underway .
it is planned to use the terrain for a mix of trade , commerce and living .
it is waiting for appropriate offers , that is to say on the part of the city .
which investor question is coming , is not yet clear .
accordingly , no contracts have been signed .
the city of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which is located on the Ring@@ straße / corner Große Straße , bought already a few months ago and the building on it can be torn down .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning of the holiday settlement on the small sea near Em@@ den takes shape .
the Investor was making public plans for the project for the first time .
many An@@ li@@ eger are still worried - they fear the selling of their leisure tour
months have passed behind closed doors , p@@ onder@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday resort on the small sea close Em@@ den on the table .
Inter@@ esting , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; System Building , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Urban Development Committee of the Em@@ de Council .
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP faction , which accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ enbach went to the offensive by the System Building Management : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we haven &apos;t got an answer yet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all ru@@ mo@@ urs now .
the project has been in the discussion for months with about ten to twelve million euros .
severe reactions among the owners of the sea , who had come to the meeting , produced the pictures and new details about the desired hotel construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , Meer@@ bu@@ den@@ ier and member of the board at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be a huge block that exc@@ els all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears like many other project critics that the traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be whole bus @-@ loads , so that that pays off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the well one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant , however , is still open .
there is still no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ enbach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still missing , the development plans are still variable .

Google launches double donations campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( O ) announced a double donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees fle@@ eing the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of the Don@@ ation call on its blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who has fled with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark train and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations will be doubled to $ 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com and can be doubled to $ 11 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many refugees also flee from Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .
coverage by Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; editing by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
for overweight diabe@@ tics , weight loss surgery can be helpful .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new trial .
it is still too early to say whether easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after the weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , which wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery .
weight loss surgery or obesity @-@ surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity operations have been shown to be efficient for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain measure of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c acid formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this surgery sank from 31 to 24@@ ,5 until the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately the same at 29 .
among those undergoing a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus dissolved completely and at 28 % in part .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved in only one percent and in some cases at only about two percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the results were better in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol in general better in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surgical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authors found out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , reflecting blood glucose levels over time .
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , write the researchers .
after surgery , the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical treatment group , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , so the senior researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported a complete over@@ growth of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who underwent a obesity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for people with BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly attached their bodies to obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it &apos;s a topic that is increasingly attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly at school times , meets the flock of her youth after years , and this falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally , we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional writer has grown up in Lang@@ weiler and is happy that she could set up a literary monument to her home town .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist guide called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed against the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the West European countries &apos; reaction to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in dealing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you must think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and true development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we must reflect on how the killing is less@@ ened in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack on 11 September and pointed out that the violent reaction of the US attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I put my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence , and it caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase in the intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
poison control centres in the USA report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years who swallow hard alcohol disinf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of recei@@ pts of disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age have reported , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children increasingly come to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants visi@@ bly while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ iny in the social media .
YouTube videos show how teenagers drink dis@@ infection only because of a cheap experience .
adolescents reported to have mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcoholic mouth water to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said .
many of the most attractive ( hand sani@@ ti@@ zer ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very appealing for children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially for small children , a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , Medical Director of the poison emergency center at the Hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the station Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t let go of si@@ p whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it is a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ hai@@ bon Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently had four sp@@ lashes of straw@@ berry fra@@ grant drugs in the school , was brought into an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that was legally regarded as drunk in an adult , Dr Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor , who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
ha@@ ung@@ jah l@@ ul@@ led her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had thrust his head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Or@@ vie@@ a Scott , N@@ hai@@ j@@ hah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez advised parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside of the child &apos;s reach .
beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants , containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
health authorities have suggested that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as active ingredient .
in January three students of the fourth class in the state of New York planned to poison their &quot; ordinary &quot; teacher by making anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; he reported a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked upon the disgu@@ ised plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bab@@ bling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and referred to disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

a 60 @-@ year @-@ old lor@@ ry driver drove towards the industrial area on the cross @-@ pole and noticed too late that two preceding vehicles had stopped at the roundabout .
as a result , he ran into the stern of an audi@@ tor with his truck and pushed this vehicle onto a previous Ford Fi@@ esta .
the accident @-@ related vehicles were damaged by a damage of about 10,000 euros , the police reported .
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer travelling and had to be tow@@ ed .

there are ru@@ mo@@ urs about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was impro@@ per@@ ly rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under increased control since they prepare themselves for confrontation with the Dutch table leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in the Scottish football boring Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers @-@ Middle @-@ Field @-@ player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch Football fans lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they show no highlights from the Celtic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s because the ran@@ gers are not there .
people here do not just talk about the return of the ran@@ ger .
they talk about the old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what interests them .
there &apos;s a lot of tension in the old @-@ Firm games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic has to fight , but the Norwegian chef s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which is now clearly ahead of the table with five points ahead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before and we &apos;ll come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , angry or sad about what happens .
we feel that way - but we must continue .
we really need the support from Celtic , because that makes the players better .
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ tious with January transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago , indicating that he hur@@ ried several of January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious at the signing of new arri@@ vals and insi@@ sts that he does not want to distur@@ b the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x squ@@ ad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in the summer will have this season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic @-@ Target person Mich@@ u with reference point
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , talking with Celtic during the transfer period , indicated that he can withdraw when his contract exp@@ ires at the Sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pla@@ gu@@ ed with a troubles@@ ome kn@@ u@@ ck@@ le for two years and has not made the passage from Wales this summer .
Hear@@ ts posted on S@@ FA battle for N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s comments
the Hear@@ ts led 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent off the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Defender &apos;s Red Card was later lifted - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said , and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t question integrity , I didn &apos;t comment on performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the incident occurred in a pub in the Ros@@ eb@@ urn area of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; said the Stür@@ mer , and added : &quot; it &apos;s safe to say that I don &apos;t come back to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot;

Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team from Aber@@ deen desper@@ ately needed to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cies to see a seventh consecutive league victory , which brought them a lead of five points to Celtic on the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team who won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , which didn &apos;t win games of this kind either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom there is a total increase .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May until July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above the figure of 5.5 percent , as shown by the figures in the National Statisti@@ cal Bureau ( ON@@ S ) .
meanwhile employment in Scotland decreased by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland dropped to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ally commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s almost a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to stay part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I Bec@@ ome a Wit@@ ness of an Exec@@ ution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
somewhat later today , except for late legal intervention , I will see a man being put to death .
when it happens and I hope that it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Dic@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January for his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would provide a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applications than places available , a more mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery occurs to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will watch it emotion@@ ally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Dic@@ si@@ ps closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pencil to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have mastered it better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong , what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Dic@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the pod@@ cast series I &apos;ve made .
I don &apos;t want to go into all the details again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Dic@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions following the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe that there is a strong likel@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters you can contact for .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
man after damp police ch@@ ase persu@@ ades to come out of the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he talked to the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang out the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , just a few metres from a police officer who tried to &quot; persu@@ ade him gently to return to the shore . &quot;
cann@@ ing V@@ ale police have been sum@@ mon@@ ed into Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them towards Cann@@ ing River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negotiating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to end the race immediately .
he pointed to the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt tu@@ ff sample at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had restra@@ ined himself for 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age alle@@ gations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like high @-@ hanging clusters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it went on .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk up@@ lifted and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
when they start thinking I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more trainers .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb rise in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stall .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I would name when asked - and offered him employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I &apos;m doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they seem to believe that I am a sc@@ am .
if that is the case , they should certainly take their n@@ oses into account , because they have failed in trying to hold me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today .
should that bring me to the point that it becomes personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L have a cow@@ ard@@ ly behavior and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I wrong for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe the people out there think that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and inf@@ ringe me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now about to think about it .
but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the train@@ ers &apos; fru@@ stration levels have been built up with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt investigation , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which pushed against the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously applied mud on the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been the whole day as it was .
but it also had the same on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation into this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know anything about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy beats against ri@@ vals for claims about w@@ rest@@ ling
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ RL . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ires allowed the Storm player &quot; E@@ Q@@ AS &quot; with his team during the high Storm winning in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a barely disgu@@ ised comment on the storm team after his team achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the tor@@ ch@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that they were only concentrated on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with tac@@ kling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers on his team is confident that they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always appears - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about w@@ rest@@ ling when they defeated us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our defensive system or the techniques around the year . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real focus , and this has provided us with the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and obviously he has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not used to losing it , so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is funny how this time is coming up again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne is talking about exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St. George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he &apos;ll take care of a cra@@ p .
but now he has a team that can play and that we watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game that you want to play when you have this type of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about having to play against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ co versus cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are p@@ auses doing and no points something exciting ?
for me it is the game boards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they mention us , it means that we will still meet them in a phase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Storm team has released this weekend since they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks the next Saturday night in the pre @-@ fin@@ als at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin on the next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bians with a $ 200,000 Guarant@@ ee on Dru@@ gs
a man who may face a lifetime penalty for his attempt to get into the possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a $ 200,000 deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later at the Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house Café , where the police found 40 kil@@ os of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life @-@ long punishment for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that could have been in the café for a harmless reason .
the Ju@@ dge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the Court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of a criminal complaint he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 as security in order to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it statements of the two persons , it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he canc@@ els his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports to the police daily and stops at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab tears apart
in case of a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 at Karlsruhe , a truck driver was severely injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent building site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to devi@@ ate at the last moment to the left , as the police announced .
the driver &apos;s cab of the crash culp@@ ture plan broke completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 Euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone from girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es to send pictures
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the phone of the girl when she was asleep , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of in@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it , found the confusing messages and immediately al@@ er@@ ted her mother .
the police took care of them and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; personal &quot; research that used terms to search for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then Ho@@ gg claimed that he did it because it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es on the internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prosec@@ utor , E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on , told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be an addiction to frigh@@ ten people .
he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but he said it had happened because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and that he asked to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was in trem@@ bling and weeping .
she also saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ant with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the defend@@ ant used computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation to speak with girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to having taken in@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year , to have viol@@ ated the conditions on 25 January and not to appear before the court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defence counsel Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg could not appear in the Register of sexual offen@@ ders , argu@@ ing that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no significant sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael dis@@ ap@@ ed the verdict until October , to get background reports on social work .
in this case , Ho@@ gg was granted a deposit but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings in other pending cases .
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of judgment .
Schle@@ user switches to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up from the main control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many of the traffi@@ ckers caused fear of discovery and arrest the people more and more on smaller border cross@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they were on foot across bridges and con@@ ges@@ tion to the German side .
there they are received by federal police and forwarded to the registration .
in comparison to the week of the week , more refugees arrived at the Munich central station in comparison to the week of the week .
by 8 : 00 p.m. , around 700 people were in the state capital , said a speaker in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city .
Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists warn of stor@@ m@@ ouses in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low @-@ pressure area over Western Europe , warm ocean air currently flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) has announced in Stuttgart .
the strong vul@@ ture is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm Henry , who crossed the Atlantic over the Atlantic over the last few days .
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are usually expected in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , up to Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and at the bottom @-@ seek@@ er with bu@@ cks of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday you can see the sun longer again .
the crowd makes it : every two years , the car manufacturers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
in 2015 , the compact cars , which are currently particularly well @-@ selling , are particularly popular .
at present , cars from the compact class are particularly popular : some 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations accounted for this segment in August alone .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public stage 17 to 27 September ) .
a number of new compact models will be introduced this year between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars .
one of the largest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is also not supposed to be much more expensive .
Opel presents an entry below the world &apos;s largest competitor VW Golf , starting at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra is available from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
the H@@ esse also offers further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder petrol engines are also included for the first time .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is already shown at the IAA .
and what will take place next to the Astra at the IAA still on new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competitor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is to be seen exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and a stressed sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes early next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan dec@@ ou@@ pling is aiming to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are un@@ worthy of human dignity
the Federal Constitutional Court has given permission to an ex @-@ prisoner of the Ju@@ dge pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , who was lod@@ ged in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision issued on Wednesday .
according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were confined within a few days in confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful : he was in the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary between June and November 2009 in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that , the man who , according to his lawyer &apos;s statements , has meanwhile been moved back to a larger cell .
his detention facility due to the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the Land of Berlin failed .
however , the constitutional judge raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and re@@ mitted the case to the re@@ trial .
they see the man &apos;s dignity violation .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if for legal reasons only a few days of prison days are decisive for compensation , a compensation claim has been given , it was said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fear the protection of the personality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Court of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of damage compensation .
in the past , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war .
thus , they spoke only in April to a prisoner of compensation , because he was imprisoned in a cell naked .
un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 also the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet .
furthermore , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had certified a decent housing in a parallel event in November 2009 .
the former pla@@ inti@@ ff was lod@@ ged every day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines for lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore always included in 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ siveness , even in fights it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Justiz@@ pres@@ se@@ amt , 21 jobs will not be vac@@ ant in Te@@ gel due to the lack of a junior staff , 19 are to drop in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) Germany , some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) showed determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following overview con@@ veys what is coming to Germany .
according to different progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) dwell@@ ings annually - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built up to now ( 250@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental properties . every year , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ ,000 social apartments fall out of the rental price , and these particularly favorable apartments will also apply to refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
this is much too little from the standpoint of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social dwell@@ ings would have to be built every year and therefore the federal government would have to invest a grant of 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
scientists and federal ministers agree that there will also be more tax benefits for investment in residential construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany are not systematically sought after their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees , it is crucial if they find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the industrial society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ u@@ hardt .
in Germany , there has been a political turn@@ around according to the Thr@@ es@@ hardt : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to recognise work .
while there was previously a ban on working for asylum seekers of up to five years , this has been reduced to three months in November 2014 , as is the Resi@@ denz@@ pflicht , which confin@@ es asylum seekers to a place of residence .
in society , too , because of the shortage of skilled labour , the point of view is mostly enforced that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly .
a major hur@@ dle to access the labour market is lacking German knowledge .
so far there is no adequate offer of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts .
for this reason , the structure of networks is , according to the opinion of Thr@@ u@@ Geb@@ hardt , the Royal Road for Labour Integration .
the Berlin school administration has noticed that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the kit@@ a , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the un@@ rooted parents it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ fol@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family yet of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the demand for teachers increased greatly due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to raise training capacities - for instance by allowing more specialised schools .
in the countries students are prepared without knowledge of German in Welcome Clas@@ ses .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ afford from the Berlin School Administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal state for@@ bi@@ ds asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception to date has been Berlin , inner sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his stance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; study willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for refugees with a reimbur@@ sement or toler@@ ation do not receive any services according to the asylum application law if they begin a study .
in principle , the latter do not receive a ple@@ dge , since they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to custody .
tolerated refugees have had to live in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 to a minimum of 15 months .
but also this financing gap has to be closed , says Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g at once .
Islam will play an important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslim , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essively clear the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and develop the existing state @-@ church right to a new state @-@ religion relationship .
also important would be the establishment of an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
the rights also include duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the representatives of Islam must agree to clear partners and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant him certain control options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also includes the willingness to take heed of religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed the concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted such conflicts in Germany immediately &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integration will be a topic of the whole society even more today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law since a decade .
but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U mur@@ ders show that the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
the same opportunities for all : what migrants &quot; organisations and non @-@ white Germans are demanding for a long time and what international agreements like the anti @-@ racism convention in Germany commit must become reality in the next few years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens are to use its opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical services to the expected refugees , says Dr. Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; as far as man@@ - power and capacities are concerned , we are creating this , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel .
however , additional money must be incorporated into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery demands that all arri@@ vals to be handed over to health cards immediately .
provided services could later be accounted for by the federal states .
and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to accept as many people with the limited range of services offered by the asylum application law .
otherwise the doctors do the language barrier above all .
so far , Berlin &apos;s health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are less informed about their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , even in doctor &apos;s sur@@ geri@@ es , interpreter costs would have to be taken over , it demands .
many refugees were also helped with more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with a different diagnostic view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among refugee children , for example , there are clearly more un@@ documented disability , and with the young people it is about HIV clari@@ fication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but with some of the other illnesses , German doctors come from their training , but Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the paras@@ ite inf@@ est@@ ation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for medical tur@@ f , even relief in sight may be allevi@@ ated by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians would have a highly developed educational system ; some of them were even doctors .
to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualification and possibly take ex@@ ams .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill according to estimates by the Bundes@@ psycho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
especially vulnerable are refugee children , Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee camp arrives traumati@@ zed in Germany .
anyone suffering from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffers , among other things , flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death .
further symptoms are sleep and concentration problems , strong timi@@ dity and emotional de@@ af@@ ness .
to prevent the symptoms from being chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
to date , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ically ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers can make an application for psycho@@ therapy in the welfare organizations , the treatment usually lasts for several months .
in addition , in the welfare organizations , mostly cler@@ ks or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide if a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to capture every age group under the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now Circus Pro@@ bst part in the Man@@ ege on a brick in the n@@ oses to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ e and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current management stage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family for more than 33 years .
the gift to appeal lies in the blood of the family .
&quot; it is important for us to get rid of people from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with world city flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometer long tour can now experience this flair .
the Circus program convin@@ ces with talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates audiences with wit and charm .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies , it wants to take up the Cuban duo easily .
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - with these words , they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is supposed to conquer wom@@ ens &apos; hearts by storm .
except through numerous salmon @-@ sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and joint @-@ ness .
balancing with the ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
for He Yu@@ an no problem .
snake @-@ humans fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics , like little others and fascin@@ ates with its ag@@ ility .
60 Emplo@@ ye@@ es from twelve nations offer diversity in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stresses Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often subject to different animal welfare organizations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes a stand : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not good for our animals , it &apos;s not good for us too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called aff@@ ection@@ ately , are read off by the eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena .
the highest commandment , therefore , is good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our small jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid isn &apos;t ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 people , we always do our best and are with all our heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invited to his performances every day from 17 to 20 September .
on Sunday the program begins at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 pm the prices are dis@@ counted .
it is also open every day from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe positions wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s el@@ dest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread rapidly across social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by statements made by members of the opposition that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with the call .
in the last month they had boo@@ sted him and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation in the Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received text messages on their phones that warned them to interfere with Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it warns the affected parliament members that the immunity in parliament ends , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party headed by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard can build up to 30.000 work@@ stations
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will split into two listed companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing enterprise hardware and service business activities .
the expected reduction of jobs leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise is smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that help businesses transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is focused on providing previously un@@ met , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it divi@@ des a company founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University , Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard , to manufacture electric plants and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage was called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to manage the return from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure provided by HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. companies , is the latest in this sector that is based on the belief that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger pointed out to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation is according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ ist scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four matches for England , and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer will certainly still be uncertain .
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that didn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger acknow@@ le@@ dges , there is the associated risk of further injury , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has registered 23 different Wil@@ sh@@ ere diseases since his debut six years ago .
he played in only 65 of Arsenal &apos;s 15@@ 7 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that in six of eight seasons , they have been one of the two Premier League clubs since 2007 / 08 , which recorded most of the vulner@@ ability .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last over the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a period of time , a time in which you have to strengthen your body and win combat power , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves .
Arsenal begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns a press within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and treat the players who need it to take a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to advance through Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , where the judge &apos;s scale was 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that arsen@@ al pulled the lesson from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by the far @-@ gone hope that its management will lead the club to its first European cup triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked at Arsenal .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show , which gives us serious lessons on male friend@@ ships
the lack of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now has become more desperate than ever before , as demonstrated suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against the Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m Campa@@ ign against a mis@@ erable life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man with the aim to question the culture that prevents men from looking for help if they need them .
friendship is the cent@@ er@@ piece in the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends first , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication conducted through social media , with its emphasis on substance on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy .
the beauty of friends was that this focuss@@ ing was put on the head .
each character was defined not by his work , but through his personality gle@@ aming through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments during soccer @-@ watching in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it , even if they often with@@ hold to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like an employee of the phone pastoral care , I explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listeners &apos; role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide has really shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions between friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one speaks openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer @-@ lasting cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
as much as my objective outside status about the phone may help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you &apos;re on this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with which to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed setting , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say h@@ ello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest

angel Di Maria and Ed@@ guy Cav@@ ani held the course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French champion down , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when scor@@ ing a head ball@@ at in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in Group A , Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champion , as it not only asp@@ ires to qualify for the kno@@ ck@@ outs , but an improvement on the way to the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but as they got the points , it was no classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed chances in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club with which he started his illustri@@ ous career back in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or outside in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause problems and to look back relaxed , even if there are certain things we need to perf@@ ecting in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , which in the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 draw in its own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing cla@@ p was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month , and he indicated why , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ i &apos;s passport behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he completed Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the grid .
however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who beat Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , played at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was a heavy opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field .
but besides a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave up , with some mis@@ ses and bad connections , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who in no less than five trials sli@@ pped alone in the first half and then abandoned after he had used him after the restart .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shot that was passed by Wil@@ de in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans thus achieved his sixth season gate after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thought that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from the very short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the end result could be low before replacement players Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a goal at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which does not have the same level .
the qualifying matches are not enough . &quot;
hats off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core collects 2.5 billion $ through stock sales
the Swiss @-@ based Gl@@ en@@ core mining giant , which is affected by single @-@ stor@@ ming commodity prices , collected $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday by a stock sales as part of its huge school denti@@ tion plan .
the London @-@ registered company Gl@@ en@@ core said in an explanation that it sold new shares worth about $ 1.6 billion in order to pay off its own debts .
the company , which in this year has lost 57 percent of its market value , fights with falling commodity prices , since China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
the issue of rights of subscription resulted in a sharp rise at the top of the London Stock Exchange on the early Wednesday morning when trading on the early Wednesday morning .
the share jumped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ en@@ core had announced last week the 2.5 billion $ stock sales as part of the more comprehensive plans to wipe around a third of its $ 30 billion debt .
the company sold the new shares to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices declined by 20 to 40 percent .

the White House confirms Xi Jin@@ ping &apos;s visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday .
the visit , the first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and reci@@ proc@@ ates President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement .
the U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a State D@@ iner , after the two leaders have conducted bilateral talks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President &apos;s visit will provide the opportunity to expand the American @-@ Chinese cooperation with a series of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi can give the opportunity to construc@@ tively tackle areas of dis@@ agreements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adds the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI , whose visit was initially announced in February , is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before travelling to New York City at the UN General Assembly in September .
it is expected that Obama and Xi address a series of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber@@ spi@@ on@@ age in China and his increasing self @-@ confidence in the disputed waters of the South Chinese sea .

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 from transferring to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago just before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times winner League winner , four times champion League winner , two times World Champion , twice World Champion , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ avi is stunning .
in the summer the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi has now revealed that he was standing in Barcelona before the European Championship in 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça would sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything back then , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered also of FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reminder : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann was taking over the FC Bayern .
guar@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is now working for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça had signed Guardi@@ ola and I played a great European Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s playing time 2008 / 2009 had been running with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the entire distance on the lawn , switched the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the king &apos;s victory at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown while discussing the diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a succession of Sunday night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown stressed the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black prot@@ agonist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about diversity , then do it in the occupation of the film and not with the lin@@ eup of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted dis@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; as the comments of the actor from The Marti@@ an intensified .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the Produc@@ er colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - whoever will be the director - as they treat the figure of the harmony , &quot; Brown said .
the only black person , and she is a mare , beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the control rights of the film ; Dam@@ on answered that their direction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end could give us something that we do not want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded from dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip , writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room , so he can explain her variety - that is SO KNO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the twe@@ ets earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4.000 pieces since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the head of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager was killed in 2014 by a white police officer , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved nationwide impact and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to apply discrimin@@ atory practices against coloured immigrants .
in February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album quiet matter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation as a response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ls invited to visit the Pope in order to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowned first champion
professional Sports clim@@ ber and guidance for Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete to win the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could finish all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale they made two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 feet climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to complete the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge in three seconds faster , making him a winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero said with E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had to live , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so all of a sudden .. as I can &apos;t imagine how it is ... the future is unknown .
the executive producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money .
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there &apos;s more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and change life , he receives the great grat@@ u@@ ity .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll get some gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had exchanged the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season ; the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit &apos;s Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
the second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
in the past , they once were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers stand in the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers were reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfect against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target field on Tuesday .
the T@@ wins gave a chance to climb up the second American league game for the second American league game .
for Detroit , though only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to grasp about a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Ex@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit the 1 / 3 inner ring 6 times and allowed three rounds .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw each game in the bull@@ pen , and therefore I want to go quite concentrated into the game .
the designated tiger hit Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two races , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Navy on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sw@@ ung the Schla@@ gh@@ ol@@ z , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( stroke training ) , looked much better out of the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three rounds in am@@ bush at the end of seventh Inn@@ ings , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon took his second bass player Brian Do@@ zier the Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy passed down the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run escape from right @-@ handed drummer Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the end run at the second , Ver@@ hagen led the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double Play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League for the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a double Play
after adding a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth Inn@@ ings , Detroit succeeded in creating a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the booth of 5 @-@ 4 .
right @-@ handed , however , made S@@ ano with three pit@@ ches for its fifth Save .
at the beginning of the game , Detroit benefited from an un@@ event@@ ful Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers scored three rounds in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been cancelled from the injury list before the game after being missing more than a month due to a lack of back .
&quot; obviously not the start I wanted , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first time , H@@ ushes delivered a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 success story with the runners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the tig@@ ers deposited in the second , achieved a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single of center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he was not particularly well beaten , but he got the right job .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch Count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ic right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four strokes .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired because of an injury to the throwing school .
he was examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the San@@ che@@ z Sh@@ oul@@ der in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the list of injuries because of a shoulder block , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is deleted from the injury list in order to fight against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the tig@@ ers since he was bought in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing on the right hip joint since 20 August .
the tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games at the target field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ota &apos;s R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to perish in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people in it will then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the City of Wiesbaden was on Tuesday evening .
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sport halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital were prepared in the last days for this event .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stay there .
they will then be distributed to other municipalities .
in the past ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people in Hessen have arrived in Hessen , according to information provided by the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium responsible for the first recording .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures an option in Syria
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the decisive re@@ thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective looking &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four years ago , we were glad that the cup of military participation in Germany has passed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends at our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid for refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Germany , Austria has again established controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary .
Germany also sent no refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it is arranged like that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the question of an agreement that Germany could pick up a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said there have already been talks between the General Director for Public Security and Represent@@ atives in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she did not call her concrete figures and pointed out interviews on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit next week together with several other EU leaders .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a common action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers plan to take a new start to the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting ( 22 September ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the Federal Government wants to support the countries in the first @-@ up and distribution of the people more strongly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government will manage this together with the countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced Chancellor Angela Merkel in late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined these people who need protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a lead perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this view has been dealt with firmly in the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or emphas@@ ised that the state as a whole must now deal with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia on the night of Tuesday .
a few hours later the government in Budapest announced to set up the border with Romania with a fence .
this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wanted to prevent smu@@ g@@ gling from smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers across Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports , thousands of migrants have emerged in Turkey on their way to the Greek border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; space probe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ ents ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the ice @-@ punch of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean is sw@@ inging .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is done by researchers from observations of the space probe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the moon turns easily on its orbit around the ring planets .
although this movement is only small , but still too large for a solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state of New York ) on Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the journal &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
already longer was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of the Satur@@ n@@ moon in 2006 , sp@@ itting water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the south pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then .
however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not clear .
R@@ ama is missing Munich several weeks

an investigation revealed an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury at the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association shared .
R@@ ama had already compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
according to Munich lion the diagnosis means &quot; presumably four weeks of compul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s hard for us , R@@ ama is a bitter loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we must now consider , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view of the possible commitment of an un@@ compromising professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the Six@@ ties presented a defensive man as a training guest .
the 30 year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at is currently &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove his ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tor@@ j@@ äger Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to the team training again next week after his conc@@ ussion .
Austrian national player should start running on Thursday already on Thursday .
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had injured himself in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) in a violent collision at the head .
contrary to his initial fears , he remained without a serious anti @-@ cens@@ orship .
no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain lots of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you want to look at his slender line , you will often get away from them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
nevertheless , the exotic fruits are healthy : they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. How@@ ever man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ur@@ sor beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits therefore supports vision , immune system , and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasantly smell .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ gos can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives hearty dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as ch@@ ic@@ ory and ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .

first fo@@ eh@@ ip , then striking cold front
in the coming night , the F@@ öhn winds its way into the valleys of the Alps @-@ side @-@ side , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz communicated on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and on the night to th@@ urs@@ day , the fo@@ eh@@ n blows partly with a stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ness through the fo@@ eh@@ ental valleys .
after bo@@ oming on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front that brings heavy rainf@@ all , wind gu@@ sts and a drop in temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently lying on the front of an extensive grav@@ ure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest exposure .
on the north side of the Alps , the fo@@ eh@@ n breaks through the valleys on the night .
as a result , the F@@ öhn winds its way from 60 to 100 km / h , occasionally and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land with more than 100 km / h in particular in the Ur@@ ner@@ land .
the F@@ öhn can advance in places to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even or@@ kan@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dri@@ es for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , moisture starts to st@@ ow on the mountain@@ side .
this is where rain stops , which lasts up to Thursday evening .
in total , more than 100 litres of rain per square meter can be expected in the south of the Alps in the next 48 hours , this has already fallen into large amounts of rain in the last few days .
on Thursday morning , the blow dri@@ es out of the air , as a result , a cold front rolls with strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east through Switzerland .
along with the cold front , the wind fresh@@ ens up to stor@@ my , and temperatures drop significantly .
the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south on the other hand it becomes sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now holds a Martin Luther place
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther site in Rome .
in the presence of President Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill named the German Re@@ former was chri@@ sten@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of ancient Rome just next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Working Group of the Protestant Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often live their faith only in secret for centuries as a minority .
with the pla@@ za , it becomes visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) regarded himself as a young August@@ ine mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city back then as a rotten thing of sin .
his negative impressions are likely to have strengthened him in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther then initiated the split of the Western Church with his theses against the trade @-@ off trade .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which has now appeared with splendid pictures .
in the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 motives has formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has preserved the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but this is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective topics , this can be quite dark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many subjects of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are cycles that focus on topics like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cross way &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; pla@@ gues , commandments or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fa@@ ther@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , he immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to Luther &apos;s publishing house with his the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with his emphasis on art books .
and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible passages chosen by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into today , into current contexts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of old painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quotation of Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ uter Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has already happened with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work out to carry me back with the Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to revi@@ ve art again in a quick@@ ening time : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is marked by advertisement today , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is displaced .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt aims to let the viewers &quot; fall in &quot; into the images , let them look at themselves , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; the image is seeking its counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art to be : &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
I did not pay attention to fully compreh@@ ending the Bible , but selected the most important , also mysterious subjects .
&quot; this was not a cooperation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here we are talking about the images , the text merely explains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther Publishing , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( Bibli@@ cal ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opening in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old @-@ Foundation on 15 November .
start of construction for BM@@ X trains
plans made , place found , companies commissioned to model earth moun@@ ds for a round course : a year later almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X train was finished again .
om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration ensured dr@@ astic drow@@ sin@@ ess , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railways .
so hill scre@@ ened , new place searched for - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will go down in October , the first parish office Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to share in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen even more visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works at the former indoor pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B expands its commitment to refugees up to 2019 , with the Bundes@@ liga a clear sign on the weekend .
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this to be the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle , it doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has to be interesting for everyone to get a grip on this subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B chief Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chanc@@ ellery next Wednesday and I meet the Minister of State Ms Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football could and wanted to help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must be politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association therefore has extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the br@@ ink of the UEF@@ A convention in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal states also support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already this weekend , the 36 professionals will sign a clear sign if they will support the print &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wir - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sports chief Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compl@@ ac@@ ency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee tragedy goes on , nobody is allowed to leave . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we can use soccer states , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the league &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Quali@@ fication game against Hungary this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach called the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 Lic@@ ens@@ ing Clubs had started their own projects in their places is great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this and next year , the association together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government will provide 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the clubs have also called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach reported .
report : SAP CEO loses an eye in case of accident
according to several reports , the CEO of Europe &apos;s biggest software corporation Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t has lost the left eye by a fall in early July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the accident on the staircase in his brother &apos;s house in the United States he fell to a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he &apos;s almost bled , was power@@ less , then dra@@ gged onto the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder of Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could go after his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come back to Germany in October and continue to run the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am full for SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner all the time , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t typically comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can do such a thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up once you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ substitute pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of battle ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen twe@@ aked a photograph and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
this is why at the weekend in Singapore , he is as little as a reserve driver for both Stam@@ il@@ ot Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button , just like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : Bv@@ C without R@@ eus against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ lows in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus will finally be broken down in the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in the du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot rely on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if R@@ eus will be there again on Sunday at the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach leaves open : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the high strain of its professionals , the sali@@ va will not only change its trunk 11 on the R@@ eus position .
so he announced a change on the goal hill position .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller occupies the place of tribal Roman Tran@@ sylvania .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he exercises on an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the world champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller will be used in all Europe @-@ league games in the future , however , Tu@@ va has left open .
with a high probability he will also contest the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ ceful statement by Mit@@ t R@@ eus , that the final suit for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , considers mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl for veri@@ fi@@ ably : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s not so wrong with Marco . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rob@@ cars : government wants to lead the way for Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany should be a technological pioneer , according to the will of the German government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IAA from a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated driving and connected driving will increase road safety and provide less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , who also come together with representatives of the industry at the IAA .
the Ministry of Transport of the Ministry of Transport says , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid increase in digital radio communication .
testing of new technology is currently being carried out on free@@ way 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to allow the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks to be imposed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; verify and adjust the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to employ around internationally for the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 ho@@ urs@@ kilometers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which until now only envis@@ ages the human being as a driver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it comes to automated driving , the car increasingly takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more a passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , mobile vehicles on public roads will not be expected until 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authors of the study estimate the value added in the driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the German site for 20@@ 25 to some 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clari@@ fied clearly .
but the Germans still see self @-@ prop@@ elled cars scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey of the For@@ sa Institute commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday concluded that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent expect only 20 years to believe that 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of the inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es count up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the USA 33 percent .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following a survey of the digital network Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the ride on all roads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could at least imagine 15 percent , in the St@@ au 45 percent .
good every fourth would leave the car in control under no circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis @-@ Euro
according to the current state of the title , the Düsseldorf Congress will only open its doors from 25 September to 4 October .
the final decision shall be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys have learned it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM @-@ apprenticeship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bol@@ l was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsorship date in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said zel @-@ Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ kl@@ ist in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; at that time Timo was also missing , and we became the European champion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should base ourselves on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the World Ranking List . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury on the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier says he was too old for an en@@ f@@ ant
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display mannequins , which look terri@@ fying human thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and that he was putting men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terrible the Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture , because I have white hairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ak , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk on the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung from September 18 , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially negative attitude toward a show of his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ dies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly ever @-@ looking work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is a super@@ bly choreograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which much effort was done : to fr@@ ise the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was especially engaged .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers paid 14 tons of material to Munich .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special delic@@ acy : a leather trousers @-@ outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tier &apos;s old Ted@@ dy is to be seen in the exhibition .
it stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he wasn &apos;t a good student and bad in football ) he put on his ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
he later taught the design of fashion myself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
for his first own fashion show he couldn &apos;t pay the models .
they got nothing but could keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener tip as a fashion niche
in the past it was about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and lace were created in a great deal for customers who processed them for example to cover blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the P@@ lau@@ en family .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener tip , fashion played a major role , was then driven by the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lindustrie - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewelry , in accessories such as bags and in regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion that re@@ jects past styl@@ istic eras is an increasing order potential .
anyone who does not use any niche in the textile branch in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the branch of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery .
only they must bear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
private specialist shops and wholes@@ al@@ ers are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach customers in this way .
the mass @-@ produced commodity is nowadays much cheaper in the Asian region and is sold almost exclusively by chains .
it also deals with the weak@@ ening of exports , currently to Russia and to the USA .
there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score points by environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since that year we have been running a quality label that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially acceptable . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch of the West@@ sächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it creates a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that must above all think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore an existing design is often only slightly different to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter was revi@@ ving the historical snow@@ ball point .
in doing so , the machine rocks small spheres in some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ thing master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took their inspiration : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before , I couldn &apos;t do anything with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the tip of the snow for her jewellery .
in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the subject of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who would like to have a mem@@ ento .
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney is planning new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends are not to be touched , but Disney still vent@@ ures into a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is not about a new movie but a kind of continuation which plays 20 years after the first film with the magical girl girl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about the experience of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the Great Depression in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the director is already certain : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI insi@@ sts on expanding economy wider for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy must open wide out@@ wards to promote growth , said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group commissioned with the reform of the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should strive to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Command Council for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promoting new businesses and driving reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management board has adopted a number of directives , including a negative list for the regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , recording private capital , and over@@ haul of the resident reporting system .
after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment .
the system is tested gradually and improved by test programs .
the initiative is of importance as it plays a major role in the allocation of resources to the market , ensures a legal framework of law and open the market open , the statement said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas will be opened for private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policies towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activities , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang G@@ oli participated as reported in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury levels in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values of mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and thus offer consumers a much higher dose of nerve toxins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation Food@@ watch , which has a corresponding working paper of the EU , sharply critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of missed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force against pregnant women and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Matthias Wolf &apos;s midt of Food@@ s@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish are to be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogra@@ m of fish .
however , large predat@@ ory fish are already so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury due to the fact that around 50 percent of catches may not be sold on the basis of the applicable limit values .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be uns@@ al@@ able .
in return for this e@@ asing , the EU according to Food@@ s@@ watch wants to intensi@@ fy the limit values for other fish from 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogra@@ m .
however , Food@@ s@@ watch described this as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller cem@@ et@@ fish , such as car@@ p , are usually so low @-@ poll@@ uted that they already comply with the planned maximum values already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of small fish is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dious distra@@ ction that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal which is highly toxic to humans , which is especially rich in predat@@ ory fish over the food chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore cau@@ tions that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; low amounts can cause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small amounts especially in un@@ born damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the valid limits but that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health hazard of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is primarily caused by coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power stations expelled more than six tons of mercury in the year , according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry , two thirds of the total amount em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish , for instance , in Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanent and nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had quoted from the paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish have already been among the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
