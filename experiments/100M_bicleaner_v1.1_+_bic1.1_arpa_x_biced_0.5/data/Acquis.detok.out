"" "the term" "" "Convention" "" "used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol." ""
The purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of the Part I on securing measures.
The aim of the safeguarding measures specified in this Convention is the timely discovery of significant quantities of nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear facilities for unknown purposes as well as deterrence of such a branching by the risk of early detection.
For the achievement of the target specified in article 28, material accounting is used as a safety measure of fundamental importance, combined with spatial integration and observation as important complementary measures.
The technical completion of the audit by the organization takes place by an explanation, in which for each material balance zone, the quantity of material that is not specified for a specified period is specified, indicating the accuracy limits for the specified dimensions.
In carrying out their postings, the organization is making full use of the Community after Article 3 full use.
The accountant and control system of the Community for Nuclear Materials according to this Convention is based on a structure in material balance zones.
In applying its security measures, the Community of de Procedures and Measures will make use of the following nature and, as far as it is necessary, foresee how they are closer and practical in the supplementary agreements:
A) a measurement system to determine the quantities of preserved, produced, lost, lost, lost, lost, or otherwise from the stock of removed core material and stock amounts;
B) the evaluation of reproducibility and accuracy of measurements and estimation of measurement uncertainty;
C) procedures for determining, checking and evaluating differences in the measurements of senders and recipients;
E) procedures for evaluating accumulation of unmeasured stocks and non-measured losses;
F) a protocol - and reporting system, which indicates the core material of the material for each material balance zone and the changes in this stock including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone;
G) precautions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly;
H) Procedure for cremation of reports to the organisation in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69.
The securing measures under this agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore processing.
B) uranium or thoriumcontaining material, which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under letter c), is introduced into States, so the association of the organization divides the quantity and composition of the material, provided that it is not introduced for specifically non-nuclear purposes;
C) leaves core material, which is suitable for fuel production or isotope enrichment, the plant or process phase in which it is produced, or if this core material or other material produced in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle is introduced into the states, so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Agreement.
A) The safeguards provided in this Agreement shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11. if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not met, however, the Community is not possible or desired from residues, for the time being, the organisation and the community should consult each other about the application of suitable securing measures.
B) The safeguards provided in this Agreement shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13, provided that the organization and the community unanimously determine that this core material is practically non-recoverable.
At the request of the Community, the organisation frees the following core material from the security measures under this Convention:
A) special fissile material when used in grams - or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments;
B) core material, if it is used in non-nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13, if such core material is recoverable, and
C) Plutonium with an isotope concentration of Plutonium-238, which is above 80%.
At the request of the Community, the organisation frees nuclear material, which would otherwise be subject to securing measures under this Convention, from these safeguards, unless the entire amount of material delivered in the States is at no point in the States as a result of this Article.
A) a total of one kilogram of special paltable material that can consist of one or more of the following materials:
II) uranium with an enrichment of 0.2 (20%) and above, calculated by multiplication of its weight with enrichment,
III) Uran with an enrichment, which is below 0.2 (20%) and above the range of natural uranium, calculates by multiplication of its weight with the fifth square of enrichment;
B) a total of ten metric tons of natural uranium and depleted uranium with an enrichment of more than 0.005 (0.5%);
C) 20 metric tons of depleted uranium with an enrichment of 0.005 (0.5%) or below;
If free core material is to be processed or stored together with the core material, which is subject to this agreement, processed or stored, provisions for the reuse of the securing measures are made on that material.
The Community coincides with the organization of supplementary agreements, which in the extent necessary for successful and effective fulfillment of the tasks of the Organization under this Convention, determine how the procedures set out in the Convention are to be applied.
The supplementary agreements can be expanded or altered without altering the agreement between the organization and the community.
The supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this agreement. the organization, the Community and the States undertake all efforts to allow these agreements to enter into force within ninety days of the entry into force of this agreement; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization, the community and the states.
The organization provides on the basis of the initial report compiled in Article 62, a summarized inventory of the core material underlying the hedging measures of this agreement in the states, regardless of its origin, and carries out this inventory based on the following reports and the results of their investigations.
Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation (Organisation) on the other
The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is impeded by general resource transfer problems.
C) It is the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution of the Member States is bound within six months of entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.
D) The EEC and the organization have consulted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bindings in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.
To this end, the organisation of the EEC has presented a table which can be seen in the manner in which it intends to apply the criteria set in this agreement -
The organization establishes a special account under the name "Special Account" which consists of the funds that the Member States contribute in accordance with this Agreement to the special transaction account; this account is governed by the organization as a steward and used (in this property the organization is referred to as "caretaker"), only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.
The transaction account is managed separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization.
The fees are to be paid as follows: a) Payment is made in the form of cash or insolvency notes issued by the member state to pay in the currency of the state in question to the organization as a manager of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the organization's deposit in the country concerned.
B) Payment shall be made in two installments, namely i) the first at a rate of at least 45 v. h. the fee within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator at the appointed time;
II) The second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another time, which was agreed between the EEC and the caretaker, taking into account the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.
C) Everyone Member State may make payments before the above-mentioned dates on request.
The caretaker takes about proportional draws on the cash or the Notes in accordance with the usual procedure of the organization, in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the transaction account appropriately.
In accordance with the terms of the EEC, the caretaker can be guided by the following factors:
III) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;
VI) the composition and the tendency of the country's debt service and its subsequent lending capacity to loan terms without any disagreement; and
VII) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources.
Any special transaction institution serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly-payable development program or superiority (including a sectoral plan), regardless of whether it is part of the organization's loan programme or not, according to the procedures and practices that are considered to be part of the organization funded by ordinary funds of the organization, and this is to be taken into account under letter b) of the preamble to this agreement.
The funds of the special transaction may not be used instead of ordinary funds of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the Organization, which are tied up in the context of a loan or credit for a program or project that has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement.
In addition to Section 4, special transactions are subject to the same repayment conditions, which are generally accepted by the organization's loans, which are payable in 50 years for 10 free years.
Special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are repayable in these currencies.
Amounts for the payment of this watch must be made directly to the organization that it retains.
Any special loan can be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the caretaker, in which the origin of the funds is stated in particular.
The proceeds from any special transaction institution can be used for expenditures in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services manufactured or produced (i) in a Member State; ii) in developing countries that are members of the organization and which, according to what the administrator has set at the time of loan guarantee, could be the recipient of a special transaction loan.
Refunds of a special transaction loan are made to the transaction account, and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state is as soon as possible from the administrator to the Member State.
The steward will instruct the EEC until the full payment of all the special transaction loans granted by the directors in preparation by the directors in preparation and via the plans and programmes approved by the directors.
During the period of repayment of the special loan invalid, the administrator will instruct the EEC on a quarterly basis on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenditure for this purpose.
The bailiff transmits the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction account with an opinion from the external auditors of the organisation for this statement.
After full payment of the special transaction institution, the administrator of the EEC reports as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects and programmes financed by the special transaction account.
The caretaker creates and carries out appropriate records and accounts, from which the contributions to the special transaction account, the amounts paid out of the accounts receivables, the amounts paid to the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the repayments to the Member States.
The EEC and the caretaker closely work together to achieve the goals of this agreement.
To this end, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the administrator until the full edition of the funds of the special transaction account, lead to an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction account, the progress of the programmes or plans financed by special action plans, and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement.
If this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date, which the EEC and the Organization may agree, the agreement and any resulting obligations of the parties are due immediately.
If the total amount of all liabilities measured by the recipients in accordance with Article II section 8 of this agreement is paid back and transferred to the Member States, this agreement and any resulting obligations of the parties are terminated with immediate effect.
This agreement requires the approval of the individual Member States and the EEC in accordance with the procedural rules of each party.
The governments of the Member States note the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the proceedings concerned.
The Secretariat shall carry out these notifications along with a Notification on the proper approval of this Agreement by the EEC.
This agreement becomes effective and comes into force on the first day of the month following the day of receipt of the above notification in the organization.
This agreement is divided in two documents in Danish, German, English, French, Italian and Dutch, with each wording as authentic.

Agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Settlements on the mobilization of the demands of the Member States within the medium-term financial contribution
The BIS could include standby loan agreements with the central banks of creditor countries if the banks issue a corresponding application.
The agreement could be closed down to the total amount of the contribution paid by the creditor country to the mechanism, while within a total limit of 2.725 billion units of accounts; this corresponds to 50% of all future delivery funds of the member countries.
Now, however, some conditions are mentioned below, for which the BIS would be prepared.
With each standby loan, the BIS would initially assume an obligation for two years, with the possibility of renewals without exceeding five years.
At the opening of the loans as well as for their eventual extension, the BIS would charge a credit extension commission.
In addition, it would be agreed that the first drawing will not be made before the end of a month after completion of the Standby agreement, so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity.
The drawing would take place in the currencies at the disposal of the agreement at the disposal of the agreement, most likely in US dollars; they would extend to periods of time which would be to be dealt with taking into account the funds of the Bank, presumably three or six months.
The conditions would correspond to those applied to the BIS at the time under similar conditions, i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to market rates.
If the BIS has to obtain the necessary means by itself on the market, then the interest rate for the application could reach a maximum corresponding to the Libor raised by a corresponding margin.
I would be grateful if you would give me the consent of the Council of the European Communities.

As part of this agreement, the export possibilities for Hammel, lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the community are set to the following annual amount: 20,000 tons, expressed in carcass weight (1).
In order to ensure a faultless functioning of the agreement, Argentina undertakes to ensure that the quantities that are actually executed does not exceed the agreed amount and are carried out according to the traditional proposal forms (frozen or frozen).
Should a change in the offer form be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade, the two parties of this Agreement shall consult each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned below in order to find an appropriate solution.
In the event that the community takes advantage of the protection clause, it commits itself to ensure that the Argentinian access to the common market is not affected by this agreement.

The community undertakes to limit the exhaustion to imports of products collected by this agreement to a Hoechst set of 10 BC. ad valorem.
At the entrance of new Member States, the community in consultation with Argentina will change the amount prescribed by number 2 according to the extent of Argentinean trade with each new member state.
The import duty of these new Member States is determined in accordance with the provisions of the Accession Treaty; this will be taken into account under the number 5 Hoechstetter of Abandtion.
The total quantity mentioned below number 2 is determined by the day of the accession of Greece to the community on 23,000 tonnes of carcass weight.
The community undertakes everything to avoid a market development that could impair the marketing of Argentine Hammel and lamb meat in the joint market within the agreed quantities.
In particular, the community meets provisions to prevent the sale of frozen meat from frozen meat due to the implementation of the ordinance which does not undermine the sales of Argentinean Hammel and lamb.
Taking into account the aims and provisions of this agreement, the Community agreed that any actual use of refunds or other promotion measures for the export of laminated sheep and lamb as well as the slaughtering of certain living sheep and lambs are only at prices and conditions consistent with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community at world trade with these products.
These terms shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with Article XVI of the GATT and in particular Article 10 (2 letter c) of the Convention corresponds to the interpretation and application of Articles VI, XVI and XXIII of the General Inch and Trade Agreement.
Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement in particular by granting export licences specified in this agreement for the products listed under number 1.
The Community shall, in its turn, undertake to take all necessary precautions to allow the issuance of import licences for the aforementioned products with origin in Argentina on the presentation of an export license which is designated by the competent authority designated by the Argentinean government.
The details of the application of this system are determined in such a way as to waive the position of a deposit for the issuance of the import licence for the questionable products.
It is also stipulated in implementing provisions that the competent Argentinean authority of the competent authority of the Community shares the quantities at regular intervals for which export licences have been issued; these details may, if necessary, be protected by country of destination.

If a reagent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer, the following factors or apparitions may not occur: a) hammolytic properties;
The titer is measured in a suitable medium through repeated dilution of the reagent to be investigated.
The titer is the reciprocal value of the number of highest serum diluted in which a reaction occurs; dilution is calculated exclusively by volume of the blood cell flow in the total volume.
In case of anti-A, anti-B or other reagents, which are to be used on object carriers, the activity is expressed by the time required for agglutination on an object carrier.
The World Health Organization has established international standards for anti-A and anti-B and anti-D reagents for blood group determination international standards, and for reagents of other specificity standards are drawn up at the time standards.
According to definition, an International standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml, and this definition is independent of the titers that are observed in individual preparations red blood cells (1).
(1) The effectiveness of reagents for blood group determination of most specificities is expressed as agglutinationstitis, which is observed in a series of dilutions in an erythrocyte inundation.
The titer indicates thinning of the reagent in the final mixture within a series where a microscopically visible agglutination occurs.
The effectiveness of the reagents for blood group determination, available for the International Standard Preparations (currently Anti-A and Anti-B and incomplete anti-D), can be expressed on the basis of the titration of the unknown reagent in comparison with the International Standard Preparation or a State Standards Preparation in International Units (see Bulletin WHO OMS 1954, 10, 937, 941 - 1950, 3, 301).
If you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml, the anti-A and anti-B shears contain according to definition 256 international units per ml.
The preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Biological Norms of the World Health Organization, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen.
The following table shows an example of comparing the International standard anti-A (S) and an "unknown" anti-A reagent (U) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A2B. > PIC FILE = "T0045083" >
If a reagent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer, its properties should remain for at least one year.
The expiry date of a reagent in fluid form, according to the label, is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test.
The expiry date on the label for dry reagents is based on the results of the durability trials; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities.
Dry reagents are stored in an atmosphere of inert gas or in a vacuum, in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no moisture can enter.
A dry reagent may lose at most 0.5% of its weight if it is tested by further drying of phosphorus-pentoxides in a pressure of no more than 0.02 mm Hg within 24 hours.
In order to prevent bacterial growth, the competent state authority can determine that the reagent (or the solvents supplied with the dry reagents) can be added to an antiseptic and / or antibiotic if the reagent with the added substance continues to fulfill the requirements of specificity and efficacy.
Sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml fluid or re-dissolved serum.
The reagents, whether in fluid form or after re-resolution, must be transparent and may not contain sediments nor visible or visible particles.
The reagents needed for the international exchange for blood group determination should not be artificially colored, at least until an international agreement has reached a uniform system.
Reagents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the reagent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells, but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells.
The quantity contained in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol.
The manufacturer laboratory has written records of all production stages and controls of the reagents for blood group identification.
Appropriate samples of all completed reagents can be stored for a long time from the laboratory until it is likely to be assumed that the batch is no longer used.
Reagents used for the determination of blood can contain substances of human, animal, plant (or mineral) origin; some of them represent the effective portion, the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the reagent.
For technical reasons these reagents are divided according to the origin of their effective percentage in three groups.
This does not mean that the reagents of human origin exclusively contain substances of human origin, or that animal or plant reagents cannot contain substances of human origin.
On each container is a black on white printed label attached in English and French, containing the following information: 1. name and address of the manufacturer,
4. the quantity or, in dried reagents, the quantity and composition of the liquid needed to replenish,
In addition, this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located, or the instructions attached to the containers, contain the following information: 1. full name and address of the manufacturer,
3. the amount or, in dried reagents, the amount and composition of the liquid needed to replenish,

Agreement ZWISCHEN THE EUROPÄISCHE economic association AND THE REPUBLIK OSTITIES IN THE TRANSIT AUF DER SCHIENE AND THE STRACE
Protocol on the Convention of 1979 concerning a dreamy, riverish air pollution control regarding the fight against emissions of nitrogen oxides or its grenched-ridden river
Concerned that the current emissions of air polluting substances in exposed parts of Europe and North America may cause damage to natural value of vital importance for the environment and the economy,
In view of the fact that the executive body recognised the need for the Convention on its second conference to effectively reduce the annual emissions of nitrogen oxides from stationary and moveable sources or their ripening flow rate by 1995, as well as the need for states that have already made progress in reducing these emissions, to retain and check their emission limits for nitrogen oxides.
Taking into account existing scientific and technical data on emissions, air movements and effects of nitrogen oxides and their subsequent products on the environment as well as data on technologies to combat emissions,
Determined to take effective measures to combat and reduce the annual national emissions of nitrogen oxides or its grenched flow, in particular by applying suitable national emission limits for new mobile, larger stationary sources, as well as upgrading existing large stationary sources,
In the knowledge that the scientific and technical knowledge of these questions further develop and that this development is to be taken into account in the review of the application of this protocol and in deciding on further measures,
