the Community and the States ensure that civil liability for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , may be used in accordance with their laws and other provisions , to the organization and their officials for the purposes of carrying out this convention in the same manner as to the nationals of states .
any claim that the Community or a State acc@@ ru@@ es to the organization or the organization vis @-@ à @-@ vis the Community or a State due to damage , except for damages arising from a nuclear incident , which resulted from the implementation of the security measures pursuant to this Convention , is governed in accordance with international law .
if the Council after examination of the relevant information submitted by the Director General determines that the organization has not been able to verify that no nuclear material , which must be subject to the provisions of the Convention , for nuclear weapons or other nuclear fis@@ sion bodies , it can reimbur@@ se the reports provided in Article X@@ II ( C ) of the Stat@@ ute and , if necessary , take the other measures envis@@ aged there .
in such steps , the Council , in which mass was acquired by the measures used for securing measures , takes into account the Community or the state - as far as each of the two parties is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to give the Council the necessary security .
at the request of the Organization , the Community or a State , consultations are held on issues resulting from the interpretation or application of this agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Community and the States are entitled to request that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention will be examined by the Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Council encourages the community and the state concerned to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
with the exception of disputes , in accordance with Article 19 or any of the measures taken by the Council , disputes resulting from the interpretation or application of this agreement shall be lod@@ ged at the request of a party to a arbitr@@ ator consisting of five arbit@@ rators .
the Community and the States appoint two arbit@@ rators , the organization also design@@ ates two arbit@@ rators , and the four arbitr@@ ator appointed by the arbit@@ rators will select a fifth complain@@ ant .
if the community and the states or the organization have not named two arbit@@ rators within thirty days after the request for an arbit@@ ration , the Community or the Organization shall seek to appoint the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbit@@ rators .
the same procedure is applicable if within thirty days after the nom@@ ination or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth ump@@ ire has not yet been elected .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal is competent , and all decisions require the consent of at least three arbit@@ rators .
the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be binding for the organisation , the community and the States concerned .
a ) This Agreement shall apply to non @-@ core @-@ nuclear states , the contracting party of the Treaty and become members of the Community ( in force , i ) if the state of the Organization is notified that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this agreement and
( II ) when the Community of the Organization notes that it is able to apply its security measures in relation to this state for the purposes of this convention .
a ) The organization , the community and the states consult each other on request of one of the contracting parties about a change of this agreement .
B ) All changes require the consent of the organization , the Community and the States .
C ) The General Director immediately teaches all Member States of the organization of any amend@@ ment to this Convention .
a ) This Convention comes into force on the day that the organization of the Community and States receives the written Noti@@ fication that their procedures for entry into force are completed .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of the Part I on securing measures .
the aim of the safegu@@ arding measures specified in this Convention is the timely discovery of significant quantities of nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear facilities for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ rence of such a bran@@ ching by the risk of early detection .
for the achievement of the target specified in article 28 , material accounting is used as a safety measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial integration and observation as important complementary measures .
the technical completion of the audit by the organization takes place by an explanation , in which for each material balance zone , the quantity of material that is not specified for a specified period is specified , indicating the accuracy limits for the specified dimensions .
in carrying out their post@@ ings , the organization is making full use of the Community after Article 3 full use .
the accoun@@ tant and control system of the Community for Nu@@ clear Materials according to this Convention is based on a structure in material balance zones .
in applying its security measures , the Community of de Proced@@ ures and Meas@@ ures will make use of the following nature and , as far as it is necessary , fores@@ ee how they are closer and practical in the supplementary agreements :
a ) a measurement system to determine the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost , lost , lost , or otherwise from the stock of removed core material and stock amounts ;
B ) the evaluation of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determining , checking and evaluating differences in the measurements of sen@@ ders and recipients ;
e ) procedures for evaluating accumulation of un@@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a protocol - and reporting system , which indicates the core material of the material for each material balance zone and the changes in this stock including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure for cre@@ mation of reports to the organisation in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures under this agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
B ) ur@@ an@@ ium or th@@ ori@@ um@@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under letter c ) , is introduced into States , so the association of the organization divi@@ des the quantity and composition of the material , provided that it is not introduced for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves core material , which is suitable for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is produced , or if this core material or other material produced in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle is introduced into the states , so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Agreement .
a ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this Agreement shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not met , however , the Community is not possible or desired from resi@@ dues , for the time being , the organisation and the community should consult each other about the application of suitable securing measures .
B ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this Agreement shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community unanim@@ ously determine that this core material is practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
at the request of the Community , the organisation fre@@ es the following core material from the security measures under this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material when used in grams - or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) core material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is above 80 % .
at the request of the Community , the organisation fre@@ es nuclear material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures under this Convention , from these safegu@@ ards , unless the entire amount of material delivered in the States is at no point in the States as a result of this Article .
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the range of natural ur@@ an@@ ium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the fifth square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) 20 metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if free core material is to be processed or stored together with the core material , which is subject to this agreement , processed or stored , provisions for the re@@ use of the securing measures are made on that material .
the Community coinci@@ des with the organization of supplementary agreements , which in the extent necessary for successful and effective fulfillment of the tasks of the Organization under this Convention , determine how the procedures set out in the Convention are to be applied .
the supplementary agreements can be expanded or altered without alter@@ ing the agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this agreement . the organization , the Community and the States undertake all efforts to allow these agreements to enter into force within nin@@ ety days of the entry into force of this agreement ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
the organization provides on the basis of the initial report compiled in Article 62 , a summari@@ zed inventory of the core material underlying the hed@@ ging measures of this agreement in the states , regardless of its origin , and carries out this inventory based on the following reports and the results of their investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other
the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is imp@@ eded by general resource transfer problems .
C ) It is the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution of the Member States is bound within six months of entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The E@@ EC and the organization have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bind@@ ings in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
to this end , the organisation of the E@@ EC has presented a table which can be seen in the manner in which it intends to apply the criteria set in this agreement -
the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; Special Account &quot; which consists of the funds that the Member States contribute in accordance with this Agreement to the special transaction account ; this account is governed by the organization as a ste@@ ward and used ( in this property the organization is referred to as &quot; car@@ et@@ aker &quot; ) , only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement .
the transaction account is managed separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the fees are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment is made in the form of cash or in@@ solven@@ cy notes issued by the member state to pay in the currency of the state in question to the organization as a manager of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the organization &apos;s deposit in the country concerned .
B ) Payment shall be made in two install@@ ments , namely i ) the first at a rate of at least 45 v . h . the fee within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the administrator at the appointed time ;
II ) The second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another time , which was agreed between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Every@@ one Member State may make payments before the above @-@ mentioned dates on request .
the car@@ et@@ aker takes about proportional draws on the cash or the Notes in accordance with the usual procedure of the organization , in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the transaction account appropriately .
in accordance with the terms of the E@@ EC , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors :
III ) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its subsequent lending capacity to loan terms without any dis@@ agreement ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
any special transaction institution serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly @-@ pay@@ able development program or superi@@ ority ( including a sec@@ toral plan ) , regardless of whether it is part of the organization &apos;s loan programme or not , according to the procedures and practices that are considered to be part of the organization funded by ordinary funds of the organization , and this is to be taken into account under letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the funds of the special transaction may not be used instead of ordinary funds of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which are tied up in the context of a loan or credit for a program or project that has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
in addition to Section 4 , special transactions are subject to the same re@@ payment conditions , which are generally accepted by the organization &apos;s loans , which are pay@@ able in 50 years for 10 free years .
special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are re@@ pay@@ able in these currencies .
amounts for the payment of this watch must be made directly to the organization that it retains .
any special loan can be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the car@@ et@@ aker , in which the origin of the funds is stated in particular .
the proceeds from any special transaction institution can be used for expendi@@ tures in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services manufactured or produced ( i ) in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries that are members of the organization and which , according to what the administrator has set at the time of loan guarantee , could be the recipient of a special transaction loan .
re@@ funds of a special transaction loan are made to the transaction account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state is as soon as possible from the administrator to the Member State .
the ste@@ ward will instruc@@ t the E@@ EC until the full payment of all the special transaction loans granted by the directors in preparation by the directors in preparation and via the plans and programmes approved by the directors .
during the period of re@@ payment of the special loan invalid , the administrator will instruc@@ t the E@@ EC on a quar@@ terly basis on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenditure for this purpose .
the ba@@ ili@@ ff tran@@ sm@@ its the E@@ EC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction account with an opinion from the external audi@@ tors of the organisation for this statement .
after full payment of the special transaction institution , the administrator of the E@@ EC reports as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects and programmes financed by the special transaction account .
the car@@ et@@ aker creates and carries out appropriate records and accounts , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts paid out of the accounts recei@@ v@@ ables , the amounts paid to the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States .
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker closely work together to achieve the goals of this agreement .
to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator until the full edition of the funds of the special transaction account , lead to an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction account , the progress of the programmes or plans financed by special action plans , and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the E@@ EC and the Organization may agree , the agreement and any resulting obligations of the parties are due immediately .
if the total amount of all liabilities measured by the recipients in accordance with Article II section 8 of this agreement is paid back and transferred to the Member States , this agreement and any resulting obligations of the parties are termin@@ ated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires the approval of the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural rules of each party .
the governments of the Member States note the General Sec@@ ret@@ ariat of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the proceedings concerned .
the Sec@@ ret@@ ariat shall carry out these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this Agreement by the E@@ EC .
this agreement becomes effective and comes into force on the first day of the month following the day of receipt of the above notification in the organization .
this agreement is divided in two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with each wor@@ ding as authentic .
considering that the agreement should be concluded in the form of a change of letters to change the connection A of the Protocol No 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the area of controlled fusion and plasma physics
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eur@@ atom &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and THE Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bundes@@ rat &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this programme includes the creation of a large test facility , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation will be transferred to a joint undertaking under Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after called &quot; Joint Company J@@ ET . &quot;
Switzerland has been involved in research work in the area of controlled fusion and plasma physics for several years and is well acquainted with the area in question .
it is in the interests of the contracting parties of the present agreement to sum@@ mar@@ ise their relevant efforts to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to speed up their respective research , which have acquired a higher priority level due to the energy crisis .
this agreement should enable every contracting party to benefit from a merger of its research efforts in the area of controlled fusion and plasma physics from the funds provided for mutual research work , avoiding unnecessary over@@ laps and , accordingly , the common goal of this research work , i.e. the cost @-@ effective competitive electricity generation by using the controlled fusion reaction , to achieve faster .
to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the parties are associ@@ ating their respective research programmes defined in Anne@@ x I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Program &quot; and &quot; Swiss program . &quot;
to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss program takes over long @-@ term objectives and forms of co @-@ operation of the Eur@@ atom program ; after inspection by the mentioned organs mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , it is necessary to include new activities relevant for the Eur@@ atom program .
every time the contracting parties adopt a new programme , the programs listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II will take place .
the association intended in Par@@ agra@@ ph 1 is realised by : - appropriate participation of each of the parties during the preparation and implementation of the programmes of the other party ;
- Exchange of personnel among the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , Switzerland and the third countries , with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories that work on the Eur@@ atom program ;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the same objective Eur@@ atom is worried that Switzerland will participate in the agreement on the promotion of human resource exchange which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agreement on Person@@ nel Exchange &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of the joint undertaking J@@ ET , whose by@@ laws it accepts .
furthermore , Eur@@ atom is responsible for the fact that Switzerland can become a contractual partner of any contract , whose goal falls within the framework of the present agreement , except for association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the period of validity of the present agreement .
the bodies charged with carrying out the association provided in Article 2 Section 1 of the present agreement are described in Article 5 to 10 of this agreement and in the association agreement .
the association agreement , in particular , fores@@ ees the suspension of a steering committee , the responsible representative of the Commission and the Federal Council .
- to monitor the development of research work and to ensure that the best possible results are achieved in line with the goals of this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program - in the following &quot; VG &quot; - represented .
the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and the cooperation in all questions relating to ongoing or planned programmes and activities in the area of Eur@@ atom program , is responsible for all research and development activities on which this agreement applies .

the agreement could be closed down to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism , while within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion units of accounts ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery funds of the member countries .
now , however , some conditions are mentioned below , for which the BI@@ S would be prepared .
with each stand@@ by loan , the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als without exceeding five years .
at the opening of the loans as well as for their event@@ ual extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit extension commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first drawing will not be made before the end of a month after completion of the Stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the drawing would take place in the currencies at the disposal of the agreement at the disposal of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods of time which would be to be dealt with taking into account the funds of the Bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those applied to the BI@@ S at the time under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .
if the BI@@ S has to obtain the necessary means by itself on the market , then the interest rate for the application could reach a maximum corresponding to the Libor raised by a corresponding margin .
I would be grateful if you would give me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could include stand@@ by loan agreements with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks issue a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would give me the consent of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the community ass@@ ures that New Zealand will not be prevented from using this agreement to use new technological developments or maintain its competitive position on the market of the community .
should a change in the offer form be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties consult each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned in clause 10 in order to find an appropriate solution .
taking into account the aims and provisions of this agreement , the Community agreed that any actual use of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for the export of lam@@ inated sheep and lamb as well as the slaugh@@ tering of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs are only at prices and conditions consistent with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the trade in world trade with these products .
the Committee regularly reviews the tendency on the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat @-@ meat market of the two parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including conditions which are of importance for the purpose mentioned in clause 7 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I uph@@ old myself , provided that your government can agree to the prot@@ est@@ ant that this writing and response letter together form an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand in this area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the event that the imports from Uruguay will exceed the agreed quantities in a year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end the imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year concerned .
the community under@@ takes to limit the exhaus@@ tion to imports of products collected by this agreement to a Ho@@ ech@@ st set of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em .
in the accession of new Member States , the community in consultation with Uruguay has changed the amount prescribed by number 2 according to the scope of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an trade with each new Member State .
the import duty of these new Member States is determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this will be taken into account under the number 5 Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ etter of Ab@@ and@@ tion .
the total quantity mentioned below number 2 is determined by the day of the accession of Greece to the community on 5 800 tons of car@@ c@@ asses .
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid a market development that could imp@@ air the marketing of Urugu@@ ay@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat in the joint market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the Community is making provisions so that the shipments of frozen meat in frozen meat are not under@@ mined by the implementation of the ordin@@ ance of Urugu@@ ay@@ an creativity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
taking into account the aims and provisions of this agreement , the Community agreed that any actual use of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for the export of lam@@ inated sheep and lamb as well as the slaugh@@ tering of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs are only at prices and conditions consistent with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community at world trade with these products .
these terms shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention corresponds to the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General In@@ ch and Trade Agreement .

the method of production must ensure that the final product is gro@@ unded in the conditions described below and does not transmit any i@@ no@@ cul@@ ation .
in addition , the manufacturing method must ensure that the antibodies in the final product are concentrated in the final product in sufficient quantities .
the method is satisfactory for each end preparation in this regard , if antibodies for at least one virus and a bacterial tox@@ in are triggered in the output and final product .
no anti@@ sep@@ tic or bacterial substances must be added during manufacture ; to ensure bacterial steri@@ lity and the stability of the final product , a suitable preserv@@ ative and a suitable stabili@@ zer can be added to it .
the final product is delivered as a solution whose immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ in@@ konzentr@@ ation must be between 100 and 170 g per liter .
II ) The electro@@ ph@@ or@@ esis , represented by exposed particles in acceptable and suitable conditions , must show that at least 90 % of the protein must possess the mobility of the g@@ amma @-@ component of the glob@@ ul@@ ins of the normal human plasma .
the final solution may not have any visible signs of precip@@ itation or clou@@ d@@ iness , neither before nor after a 7 days warming . furthermore , it is advisable .
tests with the method of centri@@ fu@@ ging in the ultra@@ centri@@ fu@@ ge to determine in which mass the product falls into components with a lower molecular weight .
the pH @-@ value of the final solution must amount to a protein concentration of 10 g per liter with a solution containing 0.@@ 15 mo@@ l of potassium chlori@@ de per litre at a measuring temperature of 15 to 25 C 6.@@ 8 ± 0.@@ 4 .

a re@@ agent for blood group identification must react with all tested blood samples which contain the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olo@@ g given to the antibody or any other substance indicated on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or appar@@ itions may not occur : a ) h@@ amm@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured in a suitable medium through repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be investigated .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of highest serum dil@@ uted in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated exclusively by volume of the blood cell flow in the total volume .
in case of anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents , which are to be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has established international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B and anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination international standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity standards are drawn up at the time standards .
according to definition , an International standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters that are observed in individual preparations red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most specific@@ ities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ tis , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in an ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the ti@@ ter indicates th@@ inning of the re@@ agent in the final mixture within a series where a microsc@@ op@@ ically visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of the re@@ agents for blood group determination , available for the International Standard Prepar@@ ations ( currently Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B and incomplete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent in comparison with the International Standard Prepar@@ ation or a State Standards Prepar@@ ation in International Units ( see Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B sh@@ ears contain according to definition 256 international units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Nor@@ ms of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institut , Copenhagen .

if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its properties should remain for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in fluid form , according to the label , is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date on the label for dry re@@ agents is based on the results of the durability trials ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no moisture can enter .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 % of its weight if it is tested by further drying of phosphor@@ us @-@ pent@@ oxi@@ des in a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
in order to prevent bacterial growth , the competent state authority can determine that the re@@ agent ( or the sol@@ vents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) can be added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic if the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to fulfill the requirements of specific@@ ity and efficacy .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml fluid or re @-@ dissolved serum .
the re@@ agents , whether in fluid form or after re @-@ resolution , must be transparent and may not contain sedi@@ ments nor visible or visible particles .
the re@@ agents needed for the international exchange for blood group determination should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally colored , at least until an international agreement has reached a uniform system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity contained in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer laboratory has written records of all production stages and controls of the re@@ agents for blood group identification .
appropriate samples of all completed re@@ agents can be stored for a long time from the laboratory until it is likely to be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
re@@ agents used for the determination of blood can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of them represent the effective portion , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are divided according to the origin of their effective percentage in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin exclusively contain substances of human origin , or that animal or plant re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
on each container is a black on white printed label attached in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the quantity or , in dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid needed to re@@ plen@@ ish ,
