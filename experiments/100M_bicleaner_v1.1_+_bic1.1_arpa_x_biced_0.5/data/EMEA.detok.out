This document is a summary of the European Public assessment report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee on Medicinal Products (CHMP) evaluated the trials conducted to make recommendations on the use of the medicine.
If you need further information about your disease or treatment, please read the package insert (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you would like more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).
It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).
B. vertebrate thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I-Disorder, a mental disorder in which the patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal elation) alternately with periods of normal mood.
Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and for the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have referred to the medicine in the past.
The injection solution is used for quick control of increased restlessness or behavioural problems if the oral consumption of the drug is not possible.
In both diseases, the solution for intake or melting tablets can be applied to patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.
In patients who are taking other drugs at the same time as Abilify, the dose should be adjusted by Abilify.

Aripiprazole probably acts primarily as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).
This means that Aripiprazole acts like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters to activate receptors.
As dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole helps to normalize the activity of the brain, reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing their occurrence.
The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent the recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies up to one year.
The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that suffered from increased unrest over a period of two hours with placebo.
In another study, Abilify was compared over 12 weeks to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence in 160 patients in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilised with Abilify.
The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from increased unrest, compared to a period of two hours by Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo.
In all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients was examined using a standard dial for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment.
The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melt tablets and the solution to intake (absorbs).
In both studies with the injection solution, patients receiving Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, significantly increased the symptoms of increased restlessness than the patients receiving a placebo.
In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effectively than placebo.
For up to 74 weeks, Abilify prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment.
Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses were also more effective than placebo for the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.
The most common side effects of Abilify for intake (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrolled), tremor (drowsiness), vomiting, nausea, obstipation, drowsiness, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.
The Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and of moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes, and in which the manic episodes were based on the treatment with Aripiprazole.
In addition, the Committee concluded that the benefits of injection solution in quick control of increased restlessness and behavioural problems in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if oral therapy is not appropriate, outweigh the risks.
In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd a licence for the placing of Abilify in the European Union.
Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes were based on the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).
The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day, once a day regardless of meals.
An increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg. has not been proven, even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.
The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, irrespective of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).
The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.
In consideration of the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).
If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of an anti-psychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazl (see Section 4.8).
Results of an epidemiological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicide in patients with bipolar disorder compared to other antipsychotics.
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disturbances), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotony (dehydration, hypovigemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acceleriated and malignant form).
3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazole.
If patients treated with Abilify treat signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia, it should be considered to reduce the dose or to break the treatment.
If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed.
Therefore Aripiprazole should be applied with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in states associated with seizures.
56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.
However, there was in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and addressing for undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole.
Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.
There are no accurate risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events associated with Abilify and other atypical anti-psychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.
Polydips, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes Mellitus should be regularly monitored with respect to worsening glucose levels.
Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle, and could lead to serious complications.
Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advised if Aripiprazole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally active drugs with overbearing side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8).
The H2 antagonist Famine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.
In a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.
It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects, which is why similar doses should be made.
In CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolizers, the common application with high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole can result in extensive metabolisation compared to CYP2D6.
Considering the common gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.
Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects, and similar doses should be made.
After setting the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose height prior to the start of the accompanying therapy.
Diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be used together with Abilify.
In clinical trials doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethmorphan / 3-Methoxymorphinan-Ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (dextrometorphic).
Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.
This drug may not be used during pregnancy because of insufficient data for the safety of humans and due to the concerns arising in animal studies in animal studies, unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the fetus.
However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against operating dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are sure that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.
The following adverse events occurred more often (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):
The frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (> 1 / 100, < 1 / 10); occasionally (> 1 / 1,000, < 1 / 100).
Schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study over 52 weeks, patients receiving Aripiprazole decreased overall less incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including Parkinson's, Dystonia and Dyskinesia compared to those treated with haloperidol (57.3%).
In a placebo-controlled long-term study of over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with an arithmetic treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.
In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole was 15.1% in patients with Olanzapine therapy.
Manic episodes in bipolar-I-disturbance - in a controlled study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients with Aria prazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with haloperidol treatment.
In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients with Ariopprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.
In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients suffering from Aria prazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.
There was no medically significant difference between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and Placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred.
Increases in CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.
The side effects associated with an anti-psychotic therapy and their occurrence in the treatment with Aripiprazole include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).
In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintended or intentional overdosages were observed with Aripiprazole alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death sequence.
There is no information about the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is useful in the treatment of overdosing as Aripiprazole has a high plasma retention.
It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated via the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D and serotonin 5HT1a- Receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HTM receptors.
Aripiprazole showed in vitro high affinity for dopamine D 2 and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine-H1receptor.
In doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg. a day over 2 weeks in healthy subjects, positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C racloprid, D2 / D3 receptor ligands, nucleus caudatus and putseeds.
In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.
In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 the proportion of responder patients who were adhering to the study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).
Current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives include PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- depressive rates, showed significantly greater improvement than in haloperidol.
In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of relapse, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% under placebo.
In an Olanzapine-controlled, multinational double blind study of schizophrenia over 26 weeks that included 314 patients and in which the primary study objective 'weight gain' was, in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of ca.
In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I-disorder, Aripiprazole showed superiority compared to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.
In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study of 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I-disorder, Aripiprazl showed no superior efficacy against placebo.
In two placebo and active controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I-disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazl showed a efficacy compared to placebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.
Aripiprazole also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania in week 12, such as lithium or haloperidol.
In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I-disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which were not based on lithium or valproat monotherapy for therapeutic serum levels over 2 weeks, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole resulted in a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.
10 in a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilisation phase before randomisation, Aripiprazl showed itself superior to the prevention of a bipolar decline, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.
Based on in vitro studies, the enzyme CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxytherapy of Aripiprazole, the N-dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.
The mean elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole in the case of extensive metabolizers through CYP2D6 and at nearly 146 hours in 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolizers via CYP2D6.
In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as did a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients no gender-related effects.
A complete pharmacokinetic analysis showed no clinically significant differences with regard to the ethnicity or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.
The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers.
A single dose study of subjects with varied liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the detriment of liver function to the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.
Based on conventional safety harmacology studies, toxicity in repeated application, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and canogenic potential, preclinical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans.
Toxicologically significant effects have only been observed in dosages or expositions that have significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no meaning for the clinical application.
The effects covered a dose-dependent side-adrenal toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the medium Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).
In addition, a cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of the sulphate conjugates of Aripiprazole in the galle of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1 to 3 times the medium Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended dose or 16- to 81th of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).
However, concentrations found in the human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found in the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy- Aripiprazole no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the Galle of apes, and are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility.
In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages, which led to expositions of the 3 and 11-fold the middle Steady-State AUC at the recommended clinical peak dose.
Perforated blister packs for dispensing single boxes made of aluminium in folding boxes with 14 x 1, 28 x 1, 49 x 1, 56 x 1, 98 x 1 tablets.
15 Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazole.
It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated via the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D and serotonin 5HT1a- Receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HTM receptors.
In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization phase, Aripiprazl showed itself superior to the prevention of a bipolar decline, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.

46 in a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization phase, Aripiprazl showed itself superior to the prevention of a bipolar decline, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.
The recommended starting dose for Aripiprazole amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day, once a day regardless of meals.
Patients who have difficulty swallowing Abilify tablets can alternatively use the melting tablets to Abilify tablets (see Section 5.2).
The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders was reported in some cases after beginning or after changing an anti-psychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazl (see Section 4.8).
Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazole.
Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, muscle rigidity, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and irregular heartbeat).
Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, where weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.
Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or during treatment with Aripiprazole
The following adverse events occurred more often (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects of the drug (*):
In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I-disorder, Aripiprazole showed superiority compared to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.
58 In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I-disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which in part did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy for therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole resulted in a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.
In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization phase, Aripiprazl showed itself superior to the prevention of a bipolar decline, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.
In rabbits, these effects after dosages led to expositions of the 3 and 11-fold in the middle Steady-State AUC at the recommended clinical stage.
Patients who have difficulty swallowing Abilify tablets can alternatively use the melting tablets to Abilify tablets (see Section 5.2).
Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazole.

200 mg of fructose per ml 400 mg Sucrose per ml 1.8 mg methyl-4 hydroxybenzoate (E218) per ml 0.2 mg propyl-4 hydroxybenzoate (E216) per ml.
The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, irrespective of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).
For the prevention of recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have already received Aripiprazole, the therapy should be continued with the same dose.
Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazole.
Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.
There are no accurate risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events associated with Abilify and other atypical anti-psychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.

Manic Episodes in Bipolar-I-Disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients with Ariopprazol-
It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated via the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D and serotonin 5HT1a- Receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HTM receptors.
In an Olanzapine-controlled, multinational double blind study of schizophrenia over 26 weeks that included 314 patients and in which the primary study objective 'weight gain' was, in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of ca.
97 In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I-disorder, Aripiprazl showed no superior efficacy against placebo.
In a relative bio availability study comparing the pharmacokinetics of 30 mg of Aripiprazole as a solution for intake of 30 mg of Aripiprazole in healthy subjects, the ratio between the geometric CMAx mean of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122% (N = 30).
99 In addition, a cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of the sulphate conjugates of Aripiprazole in the galle of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the mean dose or 16- to 81th of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).
In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages, which led to expositions of the 3 and 11-fold the middle Steady-State AUC at the recommended clinical peak dose.
Abilify injection solution is used for quick control of agility and behavioural problems in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder when oral therapy is not appropriate.
Once it is clinically appropriate, the treatment should be terminated with Aripiprazole injection solution and started using the oral application of Aripiprazole.
In order to increase the absorption and minimize variability, an injection into the M. deltoideus or deep into the gluteus maximus muscle is recommended by circumfering adipous regions.
A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) can be administered depending on individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acut therapy (see section 4.5).
If a further oral treatment is indexed to Aripiprazole, see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine on Abilify tablets, Abilify melting tray or Abilify solution for filing.
There are no studies on the efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution in patients with agility and behavioural disorders that were otherwise caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder.
If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepins is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazole injection solution, patients should be observed with respect to extreme sedation or blood pressure loss (see section 4.5).
Research on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution is not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (prescribed or illegal drugs).
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disturbances), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotony (dehydration, hypovigemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acceleriated and malignant form).
Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazole.
Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and irregular heartbeat).
Polydips, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored with respect to worsening glucose levels.
Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.
Nevertheless, the intensity of the Sedation was greater compared to the single dose of Aripiprazole, in a study in which healthy volunteers Aripiprazole (15 mg dosage) was used intramuscular, and which at the same time received Lorazepam (2 mg dosage) intramuscular.
105 The H2 antagonist Famildin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.
In CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolizers, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole can result in CYP2D6 "bad '(=" poor ") metabolizers.
Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- protease inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects, and similar doses should be made.
After setting the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose height prior to the start of the accompanying therapy.
106 Lorazepam (2 mg dosage) received intramuscular therapy was greater in the intensity of the Sedation compared to the single dose of Aripiprazole.
The following adverse events occurred more often in clinical trials involving Aripiprazole injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see Section 5.1):
The frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (≥ 1 / 100, < 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, < 1 / 100).
107 The following adverse events occurred more often (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical trials (see Section 5.1):
In a placebo-controlled long-term study of more than 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aria prazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.
In another study, more than 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients with Aria prazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.
In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients suffering from Ariopprazole treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.
There was no medically significant difference between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and Placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred.
Increases in the CPK (creatinphosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.
The side effects associated with an anti-psychotic therapy and their occurrence in the treatment with Aripiprazole include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).
110 and behavioural disturbances was the Aripiprazole injection solution associated with statistically significant major improvements of agility / behavioural disorders compared to placebo and was similar to haloperidol.
In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as agility and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazole injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms of agility and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.
The mean improvement of the initial value on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour end point was 5,8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazole.
In analyses of sub-groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agility, a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined on the basis of a reduced number of patients.
In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.
In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 the proportion of responder patients who were adhering to the study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).
Current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg depressive rates, showed significantly greater improvement than in haloperidol.
In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole (oral) significantly reduced the rate of relapse, which was 34% in the Aria prazol- (oral) group and 57% below placebo.
In an Olanzapine-controlled, multinational double blind study of schizophrenia over 26 weeks that included 314 patients and in which the primary study objective 'weight gain' was, an increase of at least 7% compared to baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of ca.
111 In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which were not based on lithium or valproat monotherapy for therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole resulted in a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.
In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilisation phase before randomisation, Aripiprazl showed itself superior to the prevention of a bipolar decline, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.
The Aripiprazole AUC is 90% larger during the first 2 hours following intramuscular injection after application of the same dose as tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.
In 2 studies with healthy volunteers the average time was applied to the maximum plasma level of 1 to 3 hours.
The application of Aripiprazole injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure (AUC), which were intramuscular in 15- and 5 times over maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.
Studies on reproductive toxicity according to IV application did not reveal any safety-relevant concerns after maternal exposure, the 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) above the maximum human therapeutic exposition of 30 mg.
Based on conventional trials with Aripiprazole (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated application, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and canogenic potential, preclinical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans.
Toxicologically significant effects have only been observed in dosages or expositions that have significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans; therefore, they have limited or no meaning for the clinical application.
The effects covered a dose-dependent side-adrenal toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).
In addition, a cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of the sulphate conjugates of Aripiprazole in the galle of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).
In rabbits, these effects were observed after doses that led to expositions of the 3 and 11-fold of the mean steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical peak dose.

The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a main study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, three of whom previously had an anthracycline.
The effect of Abraxane (in allsome gift or as monotherapy) was compared with the medication containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines for reducing side effects).
Overall, in the main study 72 (31%) of the 229 patients treated with Abraxane received treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel.
If only the patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between drugs and efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival.
In contrast, patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.
It may not be used in patients who breastfeed or have low neutrophilately in the blood before the treatment begins.
The Committee on Human Use (CHMP) noted that Abraxane was more effective in patients with the first treatment, more effective than conventional paclitaxel and that unlike other paclitaxel drugs, it does not have to be given to other medicines to reduce side effects.
January 2008, the European Commission issued a permit to Abraxis BioScience Limited to permit the placing of Abraxane in the entire European Union.
Abraxane-monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with the first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anthracycline-containing therapy is not indicated (see also Section 4.4).
In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophilharmonics < 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 following series.
In sensory neuropathy grade 3, treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached to level 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.
There is currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dosage adaptations in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function (see Section 4.4. and 5.2).
No studies with patients with impaired renal function have been carried out and there are currently no sufficient data on the recommendation of dose adaptations in patients with impairment of kidney function (see Section 5.2).
Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data regarding harmlessness and efficacy.
Abraxane is a Albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel that might have other pharmacological features than other paclitaxel formulations (see Section 5.1 and 5.2).
If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be immediately stopped and a symptomatic treatment is initiated, and the patient must not be treated with paclitaxel again.
In patients no renewed Abraxane treatment cycles should be initiated until the number of neutrophilharmonics has increased to > 1.5 x 109 / l and the thrombocyte number is again increased to > 100 x 109 / l.
Patients with severe liver function disorders (bilirubin > 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT > 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.
While a clearly marked cardiotoxicity has not been demonstrated in connection with Abraxane, cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with previous anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.
If there are nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea in the patients after the gift of Abraxane, they can be treated with the usual antiemetic and constipating agents.
Abraxane should not be used for pregnant women or women in childbearing age who do not have effective contraception, except for the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel.
Women in childbearing age should use a reliable contraceptive method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abraxane.
Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised to not produce a child up to six months after the treatment.
Male patients should be advised of a sperm conserving prior to the treatment, since the therapy with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.
Abraxane can cause side effects such as fatigue (very common) and dizziness (frequent) that can affect the perdition and ability to operate machinery.
The following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, treated in pivotal clinical phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 abraxane.
Neutropenia was the most conspicuous important hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of the patients.
Anemia (Hb < 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb < 8 g / dl).
Table 1 shows the side effects associated with the gift of Abraxane as monotherapy at each dose and indication in trials (N = 789).
Very often (≥ 1 / 100, < 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, < 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, < 1 / 1000); very rare (< 1 / 10,000).
Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate-hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatinine in the blood, elevated blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:
Dysphagia, bloating, tongue burning, dry mouth, painful gums, loose stools, oesophagitis, pain in the abdomen, sores in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:
Pain in the chest wall, weakness of musculature, muscular pain, abdominal pain, muscle spasms, pain in the skeletal musculature, flank pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness Very frequent:
Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in-line case in a population of 789 patients.
As these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual incidence are possible and no causal connection with these events was established.
Paclitaxel is an optimizing microtubules that promotes the accumulation of microtubules from the tubular indices and stabilizes the microtubules by inhibiting their idiolymerisation.
This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.
It is known that albumin mediates the transcytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel by the endothelial cells.
It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60-albuminreceptor and a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumour occurs due to the albuminous protein acidic rich in cysteine).
The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two non-randomized studies and 454 patients treated in a randomised phase III comparative study.
In a study 43 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion of over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.
In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion for 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma.
This multi-centric study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks either in the form of paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with premedication to prevent an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without pre-medication (N = 229).
In the study 64% of patients had a compromised general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.
14% of patients had previously not received chemotherapy, 27% had only adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastasis and 19% due to metastasis and adjuvant treatment.
9 The results for overall response rate and time to progression and progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving First-Line Therapy are shown below.
Neurotoxicity versus paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy level 3 at a time during therapy.
The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for decay on baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after > 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown.
The pharmacokinetic of the overall paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.
The exposure to active ingredients (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml, analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.
10 After intravenous injection of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in multi-phase mode.
The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or soft tissue adherence from paclitaxel.
In a study with patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared following an IV 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solution-containing paclitaxel.
Paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane application (43%) than after a solution-containing paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).
In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -Hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-dihydroxypaclitaxel).
After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, the mean value for cumulative urea removal was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -Hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, indicating a far-reaching non-renal Clearance.
Only a few data are available for patients at the age of 75, since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.
Chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in bright light over 8 hours.
Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anti-carcinogenic medicine and, as well as other potentially toxic substances, should be treated with caution when dealing with Abraxane.
Using a sterile syringe, sodium chloride infusion solution is slowly injected into an abraxane flow bottle over a period of at least 1 minute (0.9%).
After full encore of the solution, the carrying bottle should rest for at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wetting of the solid material.
Then the carrying bottle should be swiveled and / or inverted for at least 2 minutes and / or inverted until a complete resuspension of the powder is carried out.
If precipitations or spelt are visible, the carrying bottle must be inverted gently in order to achieve complete resuspension before application.
The exact total dose volume of the 5 mg / ml-suspension is calculated and the corresponding quantity of the reconstituted abraxane is injected into an empty, sterile PVC or non-PVC infusion bag.

Using a sterile syringe, slowly over a period of 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride infusion solution should be injected into an abraxane flow bottle.
After that, slash and / or invert the carrying bottle for at least 2 minutes and / or invert until a complete resuspension of the powder is done.
The exact total dose of 5 mg / ml of suspension required for the patient and injected the corresponding amount of the reconstituted abraxane in an empty, sterile PVC infusion bag type IV.
Parenteral medicine should be subjected to eventual particles and discolorations before applying a visual inspection, whenever the solution or the container permit this.
Stability undone opening bottles with Abraxane are stable up to the date indicated on the packaging if the carrying bottle is kept in the carton to protect the contents from light.
After the first reconstitution the suspension should be filled immediately into an infusion bag.
Member states must ensure that the owners of the marketing authorization before the market launch the medical specialist in dialysis centres and retail pharmacies with the following information and materials:
• Training brochure • Summary of the characteristics of the drug (specialist information), labelling and packaging supplement. • With a clear picture of the correct application of the product, refrigerated boxes for transport through patients.
"" "this means that Abseamed is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same drug (also called" "" "reference medicines" "" ")." ""
It is used in patients with normal blood pressure values, in which complications might occur in connection with a blood transfusion, if there is no blood circulation before the intervention and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.
The treatment with Abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in treating patients with illnesses for which the medicine is indicated.
In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood donation, Abseamed must be injected into a vein.
The injection may also be carried out by the patient or his caregiver provided they have received appropriate guidance.
In patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy, haemoglobin values should always lie in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).
The iron values of all patients are to be monitored before the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment.
In patients receiving chemotherapy, or with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by erythropoietin deficiency, or that the body does not adequately address the body's own erythropoietin.
Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a loss of blood.
It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) has been introduced into which it enables the formation of epoetin alfa.
In an intravenous injection into a vein, Abseamed was compared to a main study of 479 patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems.
All patients participating in this study had been injected Eprex / Erypo in a vein for at least eight weeks before either streamed or continued Eprex / Erypo.
The main indicator of efficacy was the change in haemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29.
The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of streamed streamed with those of Eprex / Erypo were studied in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.
In the study with patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems, the haemoglobin values of patients who were converted to Abseamed were maintained in the same measure as those who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.
In comparison, patients receiving Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.
The most common side effect of Abseamed is a rise in blood pressure, which can occasionally cause symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, smelling migraine headaches and confusion.
Streamed must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to epoetin alfa or any of the other components.
Streamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems, as further studies are required to ensure that it does not trigger allergic reactions.
The Committee on Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that for Abseamed according to the European Union regulations, evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.
The company that produces Abseamed, will provide information packages for the medical staff in all Member States, including information on the safety of the drug.
In August 2007, the European Commission granted media approval to the company Medice Medicines Pütter GmbH & Co KG for the marketing of Abseamed across the European Union.
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion demand in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphomas, or multiple myeloma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the beginning of chemotherapy).
The treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate anaemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8.1 mmol / l], no iron deficiency) if blood-saving measures are not available or inadequate, in planned major operative procedures that require large blood volume (4 or more units blood in women; 5 or more units blood in men).
For the reduction of foreign blood Abseamed can be applied before a large elective orthopaedic surgery in adults without iron deficiency, where a high risk of transfusion complications can be expected.
HB 10-13 g / dl) and expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml, which cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program.
The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6,2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients where the hemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5,9 - 6,8 mmol / l).
Symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and total disease; therefore, the doctor is required to assess the individual clinical course and disease condition.
An increase in haemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.
Because of the variability between patients, individual haemoglobin values can occasionally be observed in one patient or under the hemoglobin target concentration.
Given this haemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).
If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent haemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dose is reduced by 25%.
Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is prescribed in the lowest legal dose needed to control anaemia and anaemia.
These clinical findings indicate that patients with an initially very low Hb value (< 6 g / dl or < 3,75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 8 g / dl or > 5 mmol / l).
These clinical findings indicate that patients with an initially very low Hb value (< 6,8 g / dl or < 4,25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 6,8 g / dl or > 4,25 mmol / l).
Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week by intravenous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should take steps of at least 4 weeks).
Symptoms of anaemia and sequelae may vary depending on age, gender and total disease; therefore, the doctor is required to assess the individual clinical course and disease condition.
Given this haemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).
Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is prescribed in the lowest legal dose required to control anaemia symptoms.
If after 4 weeks of haemoglobin value of at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the verticulocyte number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the baseline value, the dose should be 150 I.U. / kg three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.
If the haemoglobin increase < 1 g / dl (< 0,62 mmol / l) and the reciprocal value of < 40,000 cells / µl is increased compared to the baseline, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.
If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week the haemoglobin value ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the Reticulocyte number to ≥ 40,000 cells / µl should be maintained three times a week.
On the other hand, the haemoglobin value < 1 g / dl (< 0,62 mmol / l) or the reciprocal cell number increased by < 40,000 cells / µl compared to the baseline value, a response to epoetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be aborted.
Patients with mild anaemia (haematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary insertion of ≥ 4 blood glucose levels is required, should receive seamed in a dose of 600 I.U. / kg of body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery.
Iron substitution should be started as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the autologous blood donation programme begins, so that large iron reserves will be available before the start of the Abseamed therapy.
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg of epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).
Epoetin alfa should be preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg each in 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards.
Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of dialysis via the hose of a fistula, followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline solution to rinse the tube and ensure sufficient injection of the drug into the circulation.
Patients who are diagnosed with any erythropoetin at an erythroblastomy (PRCA) should not receive a seamed or another erythropoetin (see Section 4.4 - erythroblastomia).
Heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (e.g. venous thromboembolism).
The application of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in patients who are unable to participate in an autologous blood donor program: severe coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial occlusion, vascular disease of carotides or cerebrovascular accidents; in patients with a recent heart attack or cerebrovascular event.
Erythroblastocystitis (PRCA) Very rarely was reported on the appearance of an antibody-mediated PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.
In patients with sudden loss of efficacy, defined as a decrease in haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the diabetic value should be determined and the usual causes for non-contact (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium oxide intoxication, infections or infections, blood loss and hemolysis) are examined.
If the Retikulocyte value, taking into account anaemia (i.e. the verticulocytes "index"), is decreased (< 20,000 / mm3 or < 20,000 / microliter or < 0,5%), the thrombocyte and leukocyte numbers are normal, and if no other cause of an active loss is found, the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow for diagnosing a PRCA.
The data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients with a risk for an anti-body induced PRCA (patients with renal anaemia) are not sufficient.
8 For patients with chronic kidney failure, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration in Section 4.2.
In clinical trials, increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given a haemoglobin target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits that can be attributed to the administration of epoetins when the haemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration needed to control anaemia symptoms and to avoid blood transfusions.
The increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure.
In patients with chronic kidney failure and clinically evidential coronary heart disease or congestive heart failure, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of the hemoglobin target concentration in Section 4.2.
According to the current findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with kidney failure, which is not yet dialysis, will not accelerate the progression of kidney failure.
Tumour patients receiving chemotherapy should consider a 2-3-week delay between epoetin-alfa drugs and erythropoetin-response (patients who may need to be transacted) for the assessment of the therapy efficiency of epoetin alfa.
If the increase in hb exceeds 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2, to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see Section 4.2, treatment of patients with chemotherapy-related anemia - Dosisadaption with the aim of keeping the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).
The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the involvement of the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.
In patients who are foreseen for a greater electro-orthopaedic surgery, the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated appropriately before epoetin-alfa therapy begins.
Patients undergoing larger elective orthopaedic surgery should receive appropriate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease.
In addition, an increased risk of post-operative thrombotic / vascular events can be ruled out in case of epoetin alfa for patients with an initial repository value of > 13 g / dl.
In several controlled trials, epoetine has not been proven to improve overall survival or reduce the risk of tumour progression in tumour patients with symptomatic anemia.
4 months in people with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy, when hemoglobin target concentrations of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) were targeted
If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporine dose should be adjusted to increasing haematocrit.
In vitro studies on tumor tissues, there are no indications of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF concerning hematological differentiation or proliferation.
On thrombotic, vascular events like myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarcts, cerebrovascular events (cerebral thrombosis), arterial thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis, aneurysm, retinalis thromboses and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients with epoetin alfa.
The most frequent side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsening of an existing hypertension.
Increased incidence of thrombovascularization (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients with erythropoids.
Irrespective of erythropoetin treatment, patients with cardiovascular diseases can come to thrombotic and vascular complications after repeated blood donations.
The genetically-derived epoetin alfa is glycolic and is identical to the amino acids and carbohydrate content with the endogenous human erythropoetin, which was isolated from the urine of anemic patients.
It could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa specifically stimulates erythropoesis and does not affect leukopoesis.
389 patients with hemoblastomosis (221 multiple myelomas, 144 non-Hodgkin lymphomas and 24 other hemoblasts) and 332 patients with solid tumours (172 breast carcinomas, 64 gynaecological tumors, 23 prostate carcinomas, 21 gastrointestinal carcinomas, and 30 more).
1895 patients with solid tumours (683 breast carcinomas, 260 bronchial carcinomas, 174 gynaecological tumours, 300 gastrointestinal tumors and 478 others) and 802 patients with hemoblasts.
Survival and tumour progression were investigated in five large controlled trials involving a total of 2833 patients; four of these studies were double-blind placebo-controlled trials and
In the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin and the control patients.
In these studies, patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin showed an unexplained, statistically significantly higher mortality rate than in controls with an anaemia due to various more frequent malignancies.
Overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin and in checks.
There is an increased risk of thromboembolic events in tumour patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin, and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.
It is not clear how far these results are transferred to the application of recombinant human erythropoetin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a haemoglobin value below 13 g / dl, since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data.
Epoetin-alfa requirements after repeated intravenous application showed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly extended half-life of approximately 5 hours in patients with kidney failure.
After subcutaneous injection, epoetin alfa's serum levels are much lower than serum levels obtained after intravenous injection.
There is no accumulation: serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift.
Bone marrow fibrosis is a well-known complication of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be attributed to secondary hyperparathyreoidism or unknown factors.
In a study on hemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa three years, the incidence of bone marrow fibrosis compared to the control group with dialysis patients (which were not treated with epoetin alfa) was not increased.
14 in animal-experimental studies with nearly the 20fold recommended daily dose epoetin alfa led to reduced oil weight, a delay of the ossification and an increase in reddish mortality.
These reports support in vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples, which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation.

Prior to the market launch and in accordance with the agreement with the competent authorities of the Member States, the holder of the marketing authorization must provide the medical specialist in dialysis centres and retail pharmacies with the following information and materials: • Training brochure • Summary of the characteristics of the drug (specialist information), labelling and packaging supplement.
The owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that the pharmaceutical vigilance system described in version 3.0 and introduced in module 1.8.1. of the approval application is set up and functional before the medicine is put into circulation and as long as it is used in traffic.
The owner of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) listed in the pharmacovigilance plan and additional measures for pharmacovigilance, as well as in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) listed in Module 1.8.2, and to carry out Risk Management Plan pursuant to any subsequent update of the Risk Management Plan.
An updated RMP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the harmlessness of the drug (Periodic Safety Update Report, PSUR) according to the "CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for Humanuse."
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted: • maintaining new information that may have an impact on current safety specifications (Safety Specification), the pharmaceutical vigilance plan or the measures for risk reduction • within 60 days of reaching an important (pharmaceutical vigilance or risk reduction) milestones • on request by the EMEA
• Have a heart attack or stroke in one month before your treatment - if you suffer from instable angina pectoris (for the first time occurring or increased chest pain) - the risk of thrombosis in the veins (deep vein thrombosis) is present - if, for example, such a drop of blood has occurred.
They suffer from severe bleeding disturbances of the heart (coronary artery disease), the arteries of the legs or arms (peripheral arterial occlusion), the cervical arteries (vascular disease of the carotides) or the brain (cerebrovascular disease) have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke.
During the treatment with Abseamed, it can reach a slight dose-dependent increase in the number of blood platelets within the normal range.
Your doctor may conduct regular blood tests if necessary, to check the number of platelets regularly during the first 8 weeks of treatment.
Iron deficiency, dissolving of red blood cells (hemolysis), blood loss, vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency should be taken into account and treated with Abseamed before starting treatment.
Erythroblastomy was reported very rarely about erythroblastomy after monor- or years of treatment with subcutaneous (under the skin) erythropoetin.
If you suffer from erythroblastomy, it will abort your therapy with Abseamed and determine how your anaemia is best treated.
Therefore, Abseamed must be given by injection into a vein (intravenously) if you are treated for anaemia due to kidney disease.
A high haemoglobin may cause problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of dying could be increased.
In case of elevated or rising potassium levels, your doctor may take into account an interruption of the treatment with Abseamed until the potassium levels are back in the normal range.
If you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clinically open coronary artery disease or congestion signs by insufficient heart performance, your doctor will make sure that your haemoglobin mirror does not exceed a certain value.
According to the current findings, the treatment of anaemia with Abseamed in adults with chronic kidney failure (renal insufficiency), which are not dialysis, will not accelerate the progression of kidney failure.
A 2-3-week delay between epoetin-alfa drugs and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the effectiveness of Abseamed.
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dye (haemoglobin) and adjust your streamed dose to keep the risk of thrombosis (thrombotic event) as low as possible.
This risk should be carefully weighed against the advantages derived from the treatment with epoetin alfa, especially if you have an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, e.g. if you are obese (adipous) or if in the past already thrombotic vascular events occurred (e.g. a deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).
If you are a cancer patient, consider that Abseamed looks like a growth factor for blood cells and may adversely affect the tumor.
If you have a larger orthopaedic surgery, the cause of your anaemia should be examined prior to the start of treatment and treated accordingly.
If your values of the red blood dye (haemoglobin) are too high, you should not get Abseamed, as there is an increased risk of blood clots after surgery.
Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / applied it, even if they are not prescription drugs.
If you take Ciclosporin (means to suppress the immune system) during your therapy with Abseamed, your doctor may possibly order certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of Ciclosporin.
Laboratory studies have shown no interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF (G-CSF and GM-CSF are instruments for the development of the immune system, for example in cancer chemotherapy or for HIV).
Depending on how your anemia affects treatment, the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control.
Your doctor will, if necessary, arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and your haemoglobin value does not exceed a certain value.
Once you are well tuned, you will receive regular doses of Abseamed between 25 and 50 I.E. / kg twice a week, distributed on two equally large injections.
Your doctor will, if necessary, arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your hemoglobin value does not exceed a certain value.
Depending on how anaemia refers to the treatment, the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until the condition is under control.
In order to ensure that the haemoglobin value does not exceed a certain value, the attending physician will conduct regular blood tests.
If it is necessary to shorten the treatment time before surgery, a dose of 300 I.U. / kg can be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery, on the day of surgery and another 4 days after surgery.
However, if your doctor thinks this is appropriate, you can also learn how to injure Abseamed himself under the skin.
Heart, heart attack, cerebral haemorrhage, stroke, temporary ischemic thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis, vascular abnormalities (aneurysm), thrombosis of the retina and blood clots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients with erythropoetin treatment.
Eye lids and lips (Quinching edema) and shock-like allergic reactions with symptoms such as tingling, redness, itching, heat, and accelerated pulse were reported in rare cases.
Erythroblastomia means that there can no longer be enough red blood cells in the bone marrow (see section "Special caution when using Abseamed is required").
After repeated blood donations, it can occur - irrespective of the treatment with Abseamed - to a blood clotting (thrombotic vascular events).
The treatment with Abseamed can be associated with an increased risk of blood prop after surgery (post-operative thrombotic vascular events) if your source tree is too high
Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will affect you significantly or if you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information.
When a syringe has been taken out of the refrigerator and reached room temperature (up to 25 ° C), it must either be used within 3 days or be discarded.
Aclasta is used to treat the following diseases: • Osteoporosis (a disease which makes the bones become brittle) both in women after menopause and in men.
It is used in patients with a high fracture risk (fractures), including patients who have recently suffered a minor traumatic fracture as when falling; • Morbus Paget of the bone, a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth.
In addition, patients with Morbus Paget should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment; patients with hip fracture should receive a large dose of vitamin D (50 000 to 125 000 IE) before the first infusion or by injection into a muscle.
The administration of acetamol or ibuprofen (means of inflammation) shortly after the application of Aclasta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after infusion, such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headache.
For the treatment of Paget's disease, Aclasta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease.
As the active ingredient in Aclasta is the same as in Zometa, a part of the data material for Zometa was used for evaluation of Aclasta.
The first study included nearly 8,000 older women with osteoporosis, and the number of spinal and hip fractures over a period of three years was examined.
The second study included 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years who had recently undergone a hip fracture; the number of fractures has been studied over a period of up to five years.
In two trials, Aclasta was tested in two trials for 357 patients and compared with Risedronat (another bisphosphonate) for six months.
The main indicator of efficacy was whether the alkaline phosphatase content in serum (an enzyme that decomposes bone substance) in the blood again normalized or decreased by at least 75% compared to baseline.
In the study with older women, the risk of fractures in patients with Aclasta (without any other osteoporosis) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years.
Compared to all patients under Aclasta (with or without other osteoporosis), the risk of fracture fractures was reduced by 41%.
In the study involving men and women with fracture, 9% of patients with Aclasta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of the patients under placebo (139 out of 1 062).
Most Aclasta side effects occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent with repeated infusions.
Aclasta must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to coledron acid or other bisphosphonates or any of the other components.
As with all bisphosphonates, patients with Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion and osteoarthritis (loss of bone tissue) in the jaw.
Aclasta producer provides information for doctors who prescribe the treatment of osteoporosis, which contains clues about how to apply the medicine, and similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor.
In April 2005, the European Commission granted the company Novartis Europharm Limited a permit for the transport of Aclasta across the European Union.

Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recent low-traumatic fracture.
The patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include: • Contract contraindication in pregnancy and breastfeeding women • The requirement of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When taking medical care or nursing care
Osteoporosis treatment • for postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recent low-traumatic fracture.
For postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men an IV infusion of 5 mg Aclasta is recommended once a year.
In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip fracture (see Section 5.1).
For the treatment of Paget's disease, Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the disease Paget.
After treatment with Aclasta's disease, a long remission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see Section 5.1).
In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget an adequate intake of calcium, according to twice daily, at least 500 mg. of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.4).
In patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first aclasta infusion.
The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days following the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by adding paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta.
Patients with kidney dysfunction (see Section 4.4) For patients with a Kreatinin Clearance < 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this group of patients.
Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adaptation is not necessary since the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients.
Children and young adults Aclasta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age, as data are missing for safety and efficacy.
Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (Kreatinin-Clearance < 35 ml / min), because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population.
Pre-existing hypokalemia is to be treated with adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before starting treatment with Aclasta (see Section 4.3).
Because of the rapid setting of the effect of coledron acid on bone reconstruction, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia can develop, the maximum normally occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see Section 4.8).
In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget an adequate intake of calcium, according to twice daily, at least 500 mg. of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).
Cancer, chemotherapy, corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene should be examined before using bisphosphonates with appropriate preventive dental treatment.
For patients who require dental implants, no data is available whether the treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteonecrosis in the jaw area.
The clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.
The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days of Aclasta can be reduced by adding paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta (see section 4.2).
The incidence of prefibrillation reported as serious adverse events was increased in patients receiving Aclasta (1.3%) (51 from 3,862) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 from 3.852).
In the osteoporosis studies (HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]) the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.
Very frequent (≥ 1 / 10), frequent (≥ 1 / 1000, < 1 / 100), occasional (≥ 1 / 1000, < 1 / 1000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, < 1 / 1000) adverse drug interactions are listed in table 1.
Renal dysfunction of Zoledron acid was associated with kidney dysfunction, which was referred to as a decrease of the renal function (i.e. an increase of serum creatinins) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.
The changes in the Kreatinin Clearance (measured annually prior to submission) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a reduced kidney function were compared in a clinical study in osteoporosis over three years comparable between the Aclasta- and placebo group.
A temporary increase in serum creatinins within 10 days of application was observed in 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta versus 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.
Based on the assessment of laboratory findings, the transient asymptomatic calcium values below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2,10 mmol / l) occurred in 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical trial compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the Morbus Paget studies.
All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study in the study to prevent clinical fractures after a hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget studies (see Section 4.2).
In the study to prevent clinical fractures after a recent fracture, vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).
Local reactions following the administration of Zoledron acid in a large clinical study were reported on local reactions to the infusion site, such as reddening, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).
Osteonekrosis in the jaw area was reported, especially in cancer patients, via osteonekrosis (primarily in the jaw area) which were treated with bisphosphonates, including coledron acid.
Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental implants.
7 patients with 7,736 patients showed osteoarthritis in the jaw area of a patient with Aclasta and a patient treated with placebo.
In the case of overdose, which leads to clinically relevant hypocalcemia, a balance can be achieved by giving oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.
Clinical effectiveness in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once per year for 3 consecutive years was demonstrated for postmenopausal women (7,736 women aged 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density value (BMD) -T-score for the swaying dog ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal fracture.
Effects on morphometric fluid fractures Aclasta lowered significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new spinal fractures (see table 2).
Aclasta treated patients aged 75 years and over had a 60% reduction in the risk of spinal fractures compared to placebo patients (p < 0.0001).
Effects on hip fractures Aclasta showed a consistent effect over three years which resulted in reduced risk of hip fractures in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).
The effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increases bone density in the lumbar spine, hips, and the distal radius compared to the placebo treatment at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).
9 Increasing the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total hip by 6.0%, the lower thigh by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.
Bone histology In the case of 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), a year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies were taken from the pelvic cavity.
A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in trabecular bone volume and the maintenance of trabecular bone architecture compared to placebo.
Bone turnover marker The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminale propeptide of the type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in sub-groups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during study duration.
After 12 months, the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Aclasta was significantly reduced by 30% compared to the baseline and was maintained at 28% below the baseline value of up to 36 months.
P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the baseline value after 12 months and was maintained at 52% below baseline value up to 36 months.
B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below baseline value after 12 months and was maintained at 55% below baseline value up to 36 months.
The vitamin D mirrors were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. orally or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.
The total moralidity was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta, compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.
Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, the Aclasta treatment increased the BMD at all points in comparison to placebo treatment compared to placebo treatment.
The Aclasta treatment led to an increase in BMD by 5.4% compared to the placebo treatment by 5.4% compared to the placebo treatment.
Clinical effectiveness in men In the HORIZON-RFT study 508 men were randomized and in 185 patients the BMD was assessed after 24 months.
The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Aclasta patients compared to 8.7% in placebo.
In another study in men (CZOL446M2308), the annual administration of Aclasta was not inferior to the percentage change of the lumbar vertebra BMD after 24 months compared to the baseline.
Clinical effectiveness of the treatment with Paget of the bone Aclasta was examined in patients aged over 30 years with radiologically confirmed, above all light to moderate severe morphology Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase in accordance with the 2,6x to 3,0th age-specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study).
11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg of zoledron acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of lacedronate once a day for 2 months has been demonstrated in two six-month comparative studies.
In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the baseline for Aclasta and Risedronat.
Patients who were classified as Responder at the end of the six-month main study (response to therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.
Of the 143 patients treated with Aclasta and 107 with Risedronat, the therapeutic response of 141 patients treated with Aclasta, compared to 71 patients treated with Risedronat, could be maintained in the mean duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after the application.
Single and multiple 5 and 15 minutes permanent fusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledron acid in 64 patients showed pharmacokinetic data which proved to be dose independent.
Thereafter, the plasma level rapidly decreased to < 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and < 1% after 24 h, followed by a long period of very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.
Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large cycle with half-life time t ½ α 0.24 and t ½ = 1.87 hours, followed by a long period of exclusion with a terminal exclusion period t ½ g 146 hours.
The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) probably represent the rapid resorption in the bones and excretion over the kidneys.
In the first 24 hours 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue.
The total body Clearance is 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h, regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.
An extension of the infusion period from 5 to 15 minutes was reduced by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the area under the curve (plasma concentration against time).
A decreased clearance of metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes is unlikely because Zoledronic acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, metabolic inhibitor of the P450-
Specific patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal Clearance of the Coledron acid correlated with the Kreatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinine Clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min) in 64 examined patients.
This results in a slight (clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney dysfunction down to a creatinine Clearance down to 35 ml / min, no dose adjustment of the zoledron acid required.
As for severe kidney dysfunctions (Kreatinin- Clearance < 30 ml / min) only limited data is available, no statements are possible for this population.
Acute toxicity The highest non-lethal injection intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and with rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight.
In dogs, single doses of 1,0 mg / kg (based on the AUC were the six times the recommended human-therapeutic exposition), administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.
Chronic and chronic toxicity In trials with IV application, the renal tolerability of coledron acid was administered in rats, taking doses of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose equivalent to the threefold human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC), well tolerated.
In long-term studies with repeated use in cumulated expositions that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects on other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, and the intravenous injection point were performed.
The most frequent occurrence in trials with repeated use was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphysis of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, a finding that reflects the pharmacological, anti-absorptive effect of the substance.
Rats observed a teratogenicity in doses of 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such a skeleton.
No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed on rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low serum calcium level.
If the medicine is not used immediately, the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application; normally, 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded.
Aclasta is delivered as a package with a bottle as a packing unit or as a bundle pack consisting of 5 packs, each containing a bottle.
Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recent low-traumatic fracture.
The patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include: • Contract contraindication in pregnancy and breastfeeding women • The requirement of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet 17 • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When taking medical care or nursing care
July 2007, amended on 29 September 2006, the Pharmackovigilance system described in the module 1.8.1 of the approval application is in force and works before and while the product is marketed.
Risk Management Plan The owner of the marketing authorization required to carry out studies and additional activities for pharmacovigilance, which are indicated in the pharmacovigilance plan of the approved version 004 of the risk management plan (RMP) in module 1.8.2 of the authorisation application and all subsequent versions of the RMP approved by the CHMP.
According to the CHMP Directive on Risk Management Systems for Human Use, the revised RMP should be submitted along with the next "Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR)."
A revised type of RMP should be submitted • If new information is known which could influence current safety, pharmacovigilance plan or activities to minimise the risk. • within 60 days when an important milestone (for pharmacovigilance or risk minimization) was reached.
Zoledron acid is a member of a substance called bisphosphonate and is used for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the bone Paget of the bone.
Declining blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens, which are made of androgens play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass that is observed in men.
In Paget's disease, bone reconstruction takes place too quickly, and new bone material is constructed unintentionally, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.
Aclasta works by normalizing the bone structure, thereby ensuring normal bone formation and reinforcing the bone again.
If you are in dental treatment or undergo dental surgery, tell your doctor that you are treated with Aclasta.
If you are using Aclasta with other medicines, please inform your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / applied, even if they are non-prescription drugs.
It is particularly important for your doctor to know if you are taking pharmaceuticals that are known to harm the kidneys.
If Aclasta is used together with food and beverages, you are concerned that in accordance with your doctor's instructions, you will have enough fluids before and after treatment with Aclasta.
Osteoporosis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as infusion into a vein.
If you have recently broken the hip, it is recommended to make the administration of Aclasta two or more weeks after the surgical care of the hip fracture.
Paget The usual dose is 5 mg, which is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as infusion into a vein.
Since Aclasta works for a long time, you may need to take another dose after one year or more.
It is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in your blood during the time after infusion.
With Morbus Paget, Aclasta can work for more than a year, and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment.
If you miss the administration of Aclasta, contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment.
Before the termination of the treatment with Aclasta Falls you are considering the termination of the treatment with Aclasta, please take your next medical appointment and discuss it with your doctor.
Side effects associated with the first infusion are very common (with more than 30% of patients), but are less frequent after the subsequent infusion.
Fever and chills, muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days following the administration of Aclasta.
Currently it is unclear whether Aclasta causes this irregular heartbeat, but you should tell your doctor if you have received such symptoms as you have received Aclasta.
Physical signs of a too low calcium- concentration in the blood, such as muscle cramps or tingling or numbes, especially in the area around the mouth.
Flu, insomnia, fatigue, tingling / studiness, drowsiness, diarrhea, stomach upset, pain, pain in the eyes, pain in the abdomen, hypertension, redness, itching, reddish skin, frequent urination, temporary increase in serum creatinins, swelling and thirst.
Persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or in the jaw were reported mainly in patients who were treated with bisphosphonates due to other diseases.
Allergic reactions, including rare cases of respiratory problems, hives and angioedema (such as swelling in the face, tongue or throat), has been reported.
Please inform your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff if any of the listed adverse events affect you significantly or you notice any side effects not listed in this use information.
If the medicine is not used immediately, the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application; normally, 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded.
In patients with a recent low-traumatic acetate fracture it is recommended to perform the infusion of Aclasta two or more weeks after the surgical care of the hip fracture.
Before and after the administration of Aclasta patients have to be sufficiently supplied with liquid; this is particularly important for patients who receive diuretic therapy.
Because of the rapid setting of the effect of coledron acid on bone reconstruction, temporary, sometimes symptomatic, hypocalcemia can develop, the maximum normally occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta.
In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget an adequate intake of calcium, according to at least twice daily 500 mg. of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta.
In patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the infusion of Aclasta.
If you need further information about your disease or treatment, please read the package insert (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
Acomplia is also applied to a diet and exercise for adult patients who suffer from obesity (body mass index - BMI) of 30 kg / m ² or above respectively, respectively, which are overweight (BMI of 27 kg / m ² or above) and beyond, one or more I
In addition, four studies were carried out in more than 7,000 patients in which Acomplia was used as a supportive remedy for smoking compared to placebo.
On the other hand, the studies on the setting of the smoking did not show uniform results, so that the effect of Acomplia was difficult to assess in this application area.
The most common side effects of Acomplia, observed during the studies (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients), were nausea (nausea) and upper respiratory tract infections.
It may also not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or treated with antidepressants, as it can increase the risk of depression and can cause suicidal thoughts in a small minority of patients.
Caution is advisable while using Acomplia with medicines such as ketoconazole or itraconazole (medicine against fungal infections), knight avir (a means of applying to HIV- infection), thromycin or clarithromycin (antibiotics). LN

In case of depressed interference, Rimonabant may not be used unless the benefit of treatment in the individual case outweighs the risk (see Section 4.3 and 4.8).
Even in patients who, besides obesity, have no apparent risks, depressive reactions can occur.
Relatives or other related persons should point out that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms and immediately seek medical advice if these symptoms occur.
• Older patients The efficacy and safety of Rimonabant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown sufficiently.
Patients with a cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction or stroke etc.) were excluded from trials with Rimonabant less than 6 months ago.
Rifampicin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, St. John's wort) has not been studied, is believed to be the simultaneous administration of potent CYP3A4 inductors the plasma concentration of Rimonabant

In Rimonabant 20 mg, an average drop of the triglycerides was seen from 6.9% (baseline triglycerides 1.62 mmol / l) compared to an increase of 5.8%
In a second study in patients with obesity and previously untreated typ 2 diabetes (Serenade), the absolute variation of the HbA1c value (with an initial value of 7.9% for both groups) was -0.8 for Rimonabant 20 mg and -0.3 under placebo.
The percentage of patients achieved a HbA1c- value of < 7% was 51% in the Rimonabant group and 35% in the placebo group.
The difference in the mean weight change between the 20 mg and placebo group was 3.8 kg (CI95% -5.0, -2.6 p < 0.001). LN
Improvement of the HbA1c value in patients who had taken Rimonabant 20 mg were about 50% due to the direct effects of Rimonabant and about 50% explained by weight loss.

Summary of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public assessment report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee on Medicinal Products (CHMP) evaluated the trials conducted to make recommendations on the use of the drug.
Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). it can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetes medication) is not indicated.
In addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), metformin can not be satisfactorily adjusted in the highest acceptable dose.
In combination with a sulfl resin or insulin, the present dose of the sulfl resin / insulin may be maintained with the beginning of the acetylene treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of the sulfl resin / insulin should be reduced.
This means that the body's own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sinks, which makes type 2 diabetes better.
In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos in tripletherapy was studied; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonylurea, in addition, they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.
In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated haemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.
Actos resulted in a lowering of the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were reduced in doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.
At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of adding actos to the existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonylurea showed a reduction in HbA1c values by 0.94% while the additional administration of placebo caused a reduction of 0.35%.
In a small study investigating the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients, patients receiving Actos in addition to insulin had a decrease in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months compared to 0.14% in patients receiving placebo.
The most common adverse events associated with Actos were vision disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypoesthesia (decreased sensitivity to stimuli).
Actos may not be used in patients who may react hypersensitive to pioglitazon or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high levels of ketone - acid levels - in the blood).
It has been decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not indicated.
In October 2000, the European Commission granted the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited a permit for placing actos in the European Union.

Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and in which metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance (see Section 4.4).
For use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, so the application in this age group is not recommended.
In patients who are threatened by the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. a previous heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the physician should start treating the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose.
Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.
Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema if pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.
A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease was performed.
This study showed an increase in reports of heart failure, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.
In patients with higher output liver enzyme values (ALT > 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazon may not be used.
If the ALT mirror is increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme levels are to be checked again as soon as possible.
If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, upper stomach trouble, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme levels must be checked.
The decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with pioglitazone should be guided by clinical appraisal up to the presence of the laboratory parameters.
In clinical trials with pioglitazone a dose-dependent weight increase was detected, which can cause fat deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention.
As a result of hemodilution, a slight reduction in the mean haemoglobin values (relative reduction of 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction of 4.1%) occurred during the treatment with pioglitazone.
Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 3-4% and hematocrits by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).
As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazon as oral double or triple combination therapy with a sulfonylurea or as a two-fold combination therapy with insulin have the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycemia.
After the market launch, a decrease in visual acuity was reported under the treatment with thiazolidindiones, including pioglitazone, an occurrence or worsening of diabetic macular edema.
It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescribing doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema if patients report disturbances of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.
In a summary of reports of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone
The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazon and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with comparative medication.
In the ProActive trial, a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 Fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazon compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with comparative medication.
Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient wishes for a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is to be discontinued (see Section 4.6).
Studies on interactions have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or drug dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.
Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, such as oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected.
The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with chamois (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of pioglitazone by 3 times.
The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8-inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in the AUC of pioglitazone.
This is due to the fact that, under the treatment of pioglitazone, hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal are reduced and thus the availability of the metabolic substrates for reddish growth is reduced.
Very common > 1 / 10; frequent > 1 / 100, < 1 / 100; occasionally > 1 / 10000, < 1 / 10000, < 1 / 1000; very rare < 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (from present data not priceless).
These lead to a temporary alteration of the lens and the refractive index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycaemic agents.
In clinical trials with pioglitazone ALT ascents more than three times the upper limit of the normal range performed equally often as under placebo, but less often than in comparison groups of metformin or sulfonylurea.
In an Outcome study in patients with advanced macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe cardiac insufficiency under pioglitazon was 1.6% higher than placebo, when Pioglitazon bzw.
Since the market launch it has rarely been reported about congestive heart failure under Pioglitazon, but more often if Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnesis.
A summary of reports of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in patients treated with pioglitazon and over 7,400 patients were conducted in the groups treated with comparative medications.
In the ProActive trial over a period of 3.5 years, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazon compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with comparative medication.
When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day for seven days no symptoms occurred.
Pioglitazone seems to have an activation of specific nuclear receptors (PPAR-γ) activated in the animal model causing increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.
It could be shown that pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose recognition in the case of insulin resistance.
A clinical study with pioglitazone versus Gliclazide as monotherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time to revitalize the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 0% after the first 6 months of treatment).
At the time after two years of therapy, blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c < 0%) was maintained by Pioglitazon in 69% of patients treated (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).
In a placebo-controlled study of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate despite three months of optimization with insulin were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo.
In patients under Pioglitazone, the median HbA1c decreased by 0.45% compared to patients receiving only insulin; a reduction of insulin dose in the group treated with pioglitazone was observed.
In clinical trials over a year, under Pioglitazon a statistically significant decrease in albumin / creatinine quotients was statistically significant compared to baseline values.
The effect of Pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was examined in a small, 18-week study of type 2 diabetics.
In most clinical studies, compared to placebo, a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol and a slight, but clinically not significantly elevated LDL cholesterol level was observed.
In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, pioglitazone compared to placebo, metformin or gliclazide reduced total plasma glucose levels and free fatty acids and elevated the HDL cholesterol level.
In comparison to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was found under Pioglitazone, while the values of metformin and gliclazide were observed.
In a study of more than 20 weeks, pioglitazone reduced not only the Nüchtern-triglycerides, but also improved the postflavonoid increased triglyceride levels, this both through an effect on triglyceride absorption and hepatic triglyceride synthesis.
In the ProActive trial, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomized in groups who received either Pioglitazon or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.
After oral use, Pioglitazon is resorbed quickly, whereby the peak concentrations of unaltered pioglitazone in plasma are usually reached 2 hours after application.
On this basis, the contribution of M-IV is equivalent to the effectiveness of about three times the effectiveness of pioglitazone whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.
In interaction studies, pioglitazon has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or drug dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.
The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with chamois (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).
After oral use of radioactively marked pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the Fate (55%) and to a lesser extent in urine (45%).
The average plasma-elimination period of unaltered pioglitazone amounts to 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolite is 16-23 hours.
The plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of the oral Clearance of the mother substance are similar.
Toxic studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume magnification with hemodilution, anaemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy.
This is due to the fact that, under the treatment of pioglitazone, hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal were reduced, thus reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for reddish growth.
In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (male rats) of the urinary bladder was induced.
In an animal model of family adenomatous polyposis (FAP) the treatment with two other Thiazolidindiones resulted in increased frequency of colonic tumors.

The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazon and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with comparative medication.
In the ProActive trial, a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 Fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazon compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with comparative medication.
In another study over two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with pioglitazon or gliclazid were investigated.
In clinical trials over 1 year a statistically significant decrease in Albumin / Kreatinin-Quotienten was statistically significant compared to the baseline values.
In a study of 20 weeks, pioglitazone reduced not only the Nüchtern-triglycerides, but also improved the postflavonic increased triglyceride levels, this both through an effect on Tryglycerid absorption and hepatic Tryglizerid synthesis.
Although the study was missing the target regarding its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the total mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary arthrombosis, and revascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that with the intake of pioglitazone no cardiovascular longterm risks are connected.

Actrophane has been investigated in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes where the pancreas does not produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively.
In the study, the concentration of a substance (glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured after 12 weeks, indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted.
Actrophane led to a decrease in the HbA1c mirror indicating that the blood sugar levels were similarly lowered as with another human insulin.
Actrophane should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or any of the other components.
In addition, the doses of Actrophane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar (see the complete list of packages).
The Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Actrophane outweigh the risks associated with the treatment of diabetes.
In October 2002, the European Commission granted Novo Nordisk A / S a licence for transferring Actrophane to the entire European Union.
Pre-mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily if a quick initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect.
The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been injected.
Patients whose blood sugar levels have improved significantly, for example, by intensified insulin therapy can change the hypoglycaemia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly.
Any change in starch, brand (manufacturer), type of insulin (fast acting, biphasic, long-acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analog) and / or method of manufacturing (by recombinant DNA to the animal of animal origin) may cause a change in the dosage needed.
If a dose adaptation is required when changing to actraphane, it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after adjustment.
Some patients with hypoglycaemic reactions after a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different compared to their previous insulin.
Before travelling over several time zones, the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may lead to that insulin and meals must be used or taken at other times.
The doctor must therefore consider possible interactions in the therapy and ask his patients always according to other drugs taken by them.
4 Unless hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, which can occur in an uncontrolled diabetes, increase the risk of abnormalities and fruit death in utero.
Severe hypoglycemias can lead to loss of consciousness and / or seizures and end with temporary or permanent disturbances of the brain function and even death.
Diseases of the nervous system Occasional - Peripheral neuropathy A rapid improvement in blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are referred to as acute painful neuropathy and are normally reversible.
5 A intensification of insulin therapy with an abrupt improvement in blood sugar levels may, however, be associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy.
Diseases of the skin and the subcutaneous tissue Actually - Lipodystrophy An injection site may cause a lipodystrophy if failed to change the settings within the injection area.
During insulin therapy, local hypersensitivity reactions (reddening, swelling, itching, pain and haematoma on the injection point) may occur.
Diseases of the immune system Occasional - Urticaria, Exanthem Very rare - anaphylactic reactions symptoms of generalized oversensitivity, including generalized skin rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal disorders, angionic edema, breathing difficulties, palpitations, low blood pressure and fainting.
However, hypoglycemia can develop gradually: • Easy hypoglycemias can be treated by the oral intake of glucose or sugary foods.
Diabetics should therefore always have grape sugars, sweets, cookies or sugary fruit juice. • Serious hypoglycemias with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a one-time relief person or by glucose which is administered intravenously by the doctor.
The effect begins within half an hour, the maximum dose is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration is up to 24 hours.
Resorption The absorption profile is due to the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resorption.
A number of split (hydrolysis) locations on the human insulin molecule were considered; none of the metabolites formed by the split is active.
Based on conventional safety harmacology studies, toxicity in repeated dose, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot be identified by any particular danger to humans.
It is recommended - after removing the Actrophane water bottle from the fridge - to increase the temperature of the insulin at room temperature (not above 25 ° C) before resuspening according to the operating instructions for the first use.
Some patients with hypoglycaemic reactions after a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different compared to their previous insulin.
The doctor must therefore consider possible interactions in the therapy and ask his patients always according to other drugs taken by them.
12 Bless hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia, which can occur in an uncontrolled diabetes, increase the risk of abnormalities and fruit death in utero.

In October 2002, the European Commission granted Novo Nordisk A / S a licence to transfer Actrapid to the entire European Union.
When two types of insulin are mixed, first the amount of fast acting insulin must be reared, then the amount of the long acting insulin.
3 If a dose adjustment is required when changing to actrapid, it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after adjustment.
Before travelling over several time zones, the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may lead to that insulin and meals must be used or taken at other times.
During insulin therapy, local hypersensitivity reactions (reddening, swelling, itching, pain and haematoma at the injection point) may occur.
Diabetics should therefore always have grape sugars, sweets, cookies or sugary fruit juice. • Serious hypoglycemias with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a one-time relief person or by glucose which is administered intravenously by the doctor.
A clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyperglycemia (blood sugar over 10 mmol / l) with 204 diabetic and 1344 non-diabetic patients undergoing larger surgical procedures has shown that a 42% reduced mortality (8% vs 4.6%) was reduced by intravenous Accorpid (blood sugar 4 - 6,1 mmol / l).
The effect begins within half an hour, the maximum dose is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total duration amounts to approximately 7 to 8 hours.
The pharmacokinetic profile of Actrapid was studied in a smaller number (n = 18) of diabetic children (aged between 6 and 12) and adolescent (aged between 13 and 17).
The data is limited, but suggests that the pharmacokinetic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults.
Infusion systems with acettrapid in concentrations 0.05 I.U. / ml - 1.0 I.E. / ml Insulin human in infusion fluids 0,9% sodium chloride, 5% D-glucose and 10% D- glucose with 40 mmol / l potassium chloride are stable at room temperature for 24 hours at room temperature.
11 If a dose adjustment is required when changing to actrapid, it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after adjustment.
Before travelling over several time zones, the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may lead to that insulin and meals must be used or taken at other times.
13 General conditions and complaints at the site of joint Occurring - Local hypersensitivity reaction at the injection site During the insulin therapy, local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and haematoma on the injection site) may occur.
Diabetics should therefore always have grape sugars, sweets, cookies or sugary fruit juice. • Serious hypoglycemias with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a one-time relief person or by glucose which is administered intravenously by the doctor.
The pharmacokinetic profile of Actrapid was studied in a smaller number (n = 18) of diabetic children (aged between 6 and 12) and adolescent (aged between 13 and 17).
The intravenous application of acettrapid made of finished pens or cartridges should be an exception and only occur in situations where no leakage bottles are available.
If a dose adjustment is required when changing to actrapid, it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after adjustment.

This can happen: • If you are injecting too much insulin, if you eat too little or leave a meal, if you exercise more than usual physically
Always set the cap of your NovoLet ready-made pens when it is not in use to protect it from light.
Use a NovoFine injection needle to avoid contamination. • Remove the protective flap from a NovoFine injection needle • Use the injection needle just and firmly on Actrapid NovoLet (Figure A) • Withdraw the large outer cap of the injection needle and the inner cap of the injection needle.
Proceed as follows to avoid the injection of air and ensure correct dosage: • Keep Actrapid NovoLet with the injection needle upwards. tap a couple of times with your finger lightly against the cartridge.
If air bubbles are present, they will accumulate at the top of the cartridge • While you continue to keep the injection needle upwards, rotate the cartridge by one click in the direction of the arrow (Figure C). while the injection needle continues upwards, press the push button in (Figure C) • Now pull a drop of insulin from the tip of the injection needle.
• Put the cap back so on the finished pen that the digit is 0 opposite the dosing stamp (Figure D) • Check if the push button is pressed completely.
If the push button cannot move freely, the insulin is pressed from the injection needle • The scale on the cap shows 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18 units.
The push-button moves outside while you rotate the cap • The scale under the push button (press dial) shows 20, 40 and 60 units.
107 • Record the highest number that you can see on the press stud • Address the two numbers to get the set dose • If you have set a wrong dose, turn the cap back or backwards, until you have set the correct number of units.
Rotate it until the push button is down and you can feel a resistance Take the cap off and put it back so that the 0 of the dosing brand is opposite.
Make sure to press the push button only during the injection • Hold down the push button after the injection, until the injection needle was pulled out of the skin.
It may be inaccurate • You cannot set a dose that is higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the remaining scale to estimate how much insulin is still left, but you can not use it to adjust or select your dose.

The dose can be corrected both upwards and down by turning the dose selection button in the appropriate direction until the correct dose is compared to the dose of the dose indicator.
Adenuric is used in patients with signs of crystallized deposits, including arthritis (pain and inflammation in the joints) or gkin marks ("stones" i.e. larger deposits of urine that can lead to joint and bone damage).
If the uric acid levels are still more than 6 mg per deciliter after two to four weeks, the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day.
There are still some cases of seizures during the first treatment months; therefore, it is recommended that patients with Adenuric take another medicine for the prevention of seizures at least during the first six months of treatment with Adenuric.
The medicine is not recommended for children and in patients who had an organ transplant because it was not studied for these groups.
In the first study involving 1,072 patients, the effectiveness of three different adenuric dosages (once daily 80, 120 and 240 mg) was compared to placebo (placebo) and Allopurinol (another medicine for the treatment of hyperuricemia).
In the second study, two doses of adenuric (once daily 80 and 120 mg) were compared to 762 patients with Allopurinol for one year.
In both studies, Allopurinol was used in a dose of 300 mg once a day; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day.
The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose uric acid levels in the blood were under 6 mg / dl during the last three measurements.
In the first study 48% (126 of 262) of patients who received 80 mg once daily in a dose and 65% (175 of 269) of patients who received 120 mg once a day in the last three measurements showed a uric acid levels in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl.
In comparison, this was the case with 22% (60 of 268) of the patients under Allopurinol and none of the 134 patients under placebo.
The most common side effects of Adenuric (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are headache, diarrhea, nausea (nausea), rash and abnormal liver enzymes.
In particular, patients with heart problems in prehistory may also have an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels.
The Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that adenuric was more effective in lowering the uric acid level in the blood than Allopurinol, but could also have a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels.
Treatment of chronic hyperuricaemia in diseases that have already led to deposits (including a well known or currently present palsy node and / or rheumatic arthritis).
If the serum resistivity retains > 6 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) after 2-4 weeks, a dose increase on ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x can be considered daily.
For patients with severe kidney function, efficacy and safety have not yet been fully investigated (Kreatinin- Clearance < 30 ml / min, see section 5.2).
Since there are no experiences with children and adolescents, the application of febuxostat in this group of patients is not recommended.
Since there are no experiences with organ transplants, the application of Febuxostat in this group of patients is not recommended (see Section 5.1).
In patients with ischemic heart disease or decompensated heart failure, the treatment with Febuxostat is not recommended (see Section 4.8).
As with other hard-acid medicines, an acute gout attack can occur during the treatment process, because the reduction of the serum levels can first mobilise uric acid deposits in the tissue.
B. in malignant diseases and their treatment, lesch- nine syndrome) the absolute concentration of xanthin in the urine rarely increases so far in the urine that it comes to a deposit in the urinary tract.
Liver disease During phase 3 clinical studies, mild symptoms of liver function were observed in patients treated with Febuxostat (3.5%).
It is therefore recommended to perform a liver function before beginning of the febuxostasis and in the subsequent course of the liver (see section 5.1).
Theophylline Zwas did not have interactions with Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO inhibitory can lead to an increase in theophyllic mirror (a blocking of the metabolism of theophylline was also reported for other XO inhibitors).
Subjects were the simultaneous administration of Febuxostat and naproxen 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in febuxostatexexposure (CMAx 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).
In clinical trials, the use of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not associated with a clinically significant increase in adverse events.
Colchicin / Indometacin / Hydrochloroazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin without any dose adaptation required for febuxostat or the other active ingredient used at the same time.
In a study with subjects 120mg ADENURIC 1 x had an average 22% increase in AUC from Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, indicating a possible weak inhibitory effect of febuxostat to the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.
Antacids It could be shown that the simultaneous seizure of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide, delayed the absorption of febuxostat (around 1 hour) and a decrease in CMAx by 32%, but no significant change in the AUC.
Pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregnancies can not be related to side effects of febuxostat on pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborn baby.
Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see section 5.3).
Patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle, operating of machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that ADENURIC does not adversely affect their performance.
A numerically higher incidence of cardiac events reported by the investigator was observed in the total febuxostagroup in the pivot study of Phase 3 (1.3 vs. 0.7 events per 100 patient years) and in long-term extension studies (1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years), although no statistically significant differences were found and no causal connection with Febuxostat could be detected.
The risk factors observed in these patients were an arteriosclerotic disease and / or a myocardial infarction or a decompensated heart failure in the medical history.
Frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to < 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1000 to < 1 / 1000) adverse events that occurred in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of febuxostat and which were reported in all of the Febuxostat treatment groups more than once, are listed below.
Diarrhea, nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are treated with Colchicin at the same time. * * In the clinical studies no serious rash or severe hypersensitivity reactions were observed.
7 open long-term extension studies included 906 patients up to 1 year, 322 patients up to 2 years, 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg.
The events related to treatment during long-term renewal studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies (see table 1).
The following treatment-related events were reported in all Febuxostats treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients receiving Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg in long-term extension studies (up to 4 years with exposure time of > 1,900 patient years), according to the indications.
The following treatment-related events were either not reported at all in pivotal studies in phase 3 or with a lower frequency:
Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, insomnia, hypesthesia, conspicuous EKG, coughing, shortness of skin, protein uria, renal insufficiency, erectile dysfunction, increase in potassium concentration in the blood, decrease of TSH concentrations in the blood, decrease of lymphocyte number, decrease in the number of white blood cells.
Uric acid is the final product of the Purinmetabolism in humans and arises as part of the reaction cascade hypoxanthin → Xanthin → uric acid.
Febuxostat is a potent, non-selective inhibitor of the XO (NP-SIxO) inhibitor with a Ki value for in vitro-inhibition that lies beneath the nanomolar range.
Clinical study results The efficacy of ADENURIC was shown in two pivotal studies of phase 3 (APEX study and FACT study as described below), which were performed with 1,832 patients with hyperuricemia and gout.
The primary efficacy endpoint was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month-monthly serum acid levels were < 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l).
Placebo (n = 134), ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 240 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 240 mg 1 x daily (n = 258) for patients with a serum creatine value at the beginning of study > 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl.
The APEX study showed statistically significant superiority in treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventionally used doses of Allopurinol 300 mg (n = 258) / 100 mg (n = 10).
The FACT study showed statistically significant superiority in treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional dose Allopurinol 300 mg.
Patients with serum creatinine values > 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl) or 300 mg 1 x daily (n = 509) were combined for analysis. * p < 0.001 versus Allopurinol, # p < 0.001 versus 80 mg
The lowering of the serum pole on < 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) was observed during the doctor's visit in week 2 and kept permanently over the entire treatment.
509 patients received Allopurinol 300 mg 1 x daily; 10 patients with serum supplementation > 1.5 and < 2,0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily.
Primary endpoint in the sub-group of patients with kidney dysfunction The APEX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction (i.e., h).
ADENURIC was the primary efficacy endpoint of 44% (80 mg 1 x daily), 45% (120 mg 1 x daily) and 60% (240 mg 1 x daily) of patients.
There were no clinically significant differences in the percentage decline of the serum harnacid concentrations in subjects, irrespective of their kidney function (58% in the group with normal kidney function and 55% in the group with severe kidney function disorders).
Primary endpoint in the sub-group of patients with serum acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl. of the patients (APEX and FACT study) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study (baseline).
The data from the open extension study of Phase 3 demonstrated that the permanent reduction of serum levels to < 6 mg / dl (< 357 µmol / l) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of gout attacks, so that less than 3% of patients needed 16-24 treatment against rheumatic supplies (i.e. more than 97% of patients did not need treatment against rheumatism).
This was associated with a reduction in the palsy size, which in 54% of patients resulted in a complete disappearance of the gnocchi up to month 24.
Advanced TSH values (> 5.5 µIE / ml) were observed in patients receiving long-term treatment with Febuxostat (5.0%) and also in patients receiving Allopurinol (5.8%) in open long-term extension studies (see Section 4.4).
In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentrations (CMAx) and the surface area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of febuxostat after administration of simpler and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose-proportional.
For doses of between 120 mg and 300 mg, an increase in AUC is observed for Febuxostat, which is greater than the dose-proportional increase.
After taking simple or multiple orally doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily, the CMAx amounts to approximately 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5,0-5.3 µg / ml.
However, no clinically significant changes were observed in the percentage decrease in the serum resin concentration provided this was checked (multiple doses of 80 mg).
Distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume (Vss / F) of Febuxostat is between 29 and 75 litres after doses of 10-300 mg.
The plasma concentration of febuxostat is about 99.2% (primary bond to albumin) and is constant over the concentration range achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg.
In vitro studies in human liver microsoms, these oxidative metabolites are primarily formed by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or CYP2C9, and that Febuxostaight curonid is mainly caused by UGT 1A1, 1A8 and 1A9.
After taking an 80 mg dose of 14C-Marked Febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was found in the urine as an unchanged febuxostat (30%), the well-known oxidative metabolites and its conjugate (13%) and other unknown metabolites (3%).
In addition to excretion over the urine, approximately 45% of the dose in the chair appeared as an unchanged febuxostat (12%), Acylglucuronid of the active substance (1%), its well-known oxidative metabolites and its conjugate (25%) and other unknown metabolites (7%).
Specific patient arms of renal insufficiency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe kidney failure, the CMAx of Febuxostat did not change compared to subjects with normal kidney function.
The average total AUC of Febuxostat increased by about 1.8-fold of 7.5 μ g throat / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.2 μ g throat / ml in the group with severe kidney stone function.
12 Liver function restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild (ChildPugh classification A) or moderate (Child-Pugh classification B) Liver function restriction, the CMAx and AUC of Febuxostat and its metabolites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function.
Age There were no significant changes with regard to the AUC of Febuxostat or its metabolites after consuming multiple oral doses of ADENURIC in elderly patients compared to younger patients.
Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility In male rats, a statistically significant increase of urinary bladder tumours (transition cell papillomas and carcinomas) was found only in connection with Xanthin stones in the highly dosed group, with about 11 times the exposure to humans.
These findings are seen as a result of a specific purinmetabolization and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use.
It was found that in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day, febuxostat has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats.
At high doses, which were about 4-fold of human therapeutic exposure, maternal toxicity occurred, accompanied by a decrease in rearing performance and a developmental delay in the offspring of rats.
Teratological studies in bearing rats with expositions approximately 4,3 times and in carrying rabbits with expositions approximately 13 times the human therapeutic exposition did not reveal teratogenic effects.
Colchicin / Indometacin / Hydrochloroazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin without any dose adaptation required for febuxostat or the other active ingredient used at the same time.
Diarrhea, nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are treated with Colchicin at the same time. * * In the clinical studies no serious rash or severe hypersensitivity reactions were observed.
21 open long-term extension studies included 906 patients up to 1 year, 322 patients up to 2 years, 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg.
The primary efficacy endpoint was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month-monthly serum acid levels were < 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l).
The data from the open extension study of Phase 3 demonstrated that the permanent reduction of serum levels to < 6 mg / dl (< 357 µmol / l) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of gout attacks, so that less than 3% of patients needed 16-24 treatment against rheumatic supplies (i.e. more than 97% of patients did not need treatment against rheumatism).
26 as an unchanged febuxostat (3%), Acylglucuronid of the active substance (30%), its well-known oxidative metabolites and its conjugate (13%) and other unknown metabolites (3%).
Liver function restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild (ChildPugh classification A) or moderate (Child-Pugh classification B) Liver function restriction, the CMAx and AUC of Febuxostat and its metabolites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function.
Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility In male rats, a statistically significant increase of urinary bladder tumours (transition cell papillomas and carcinomas) was found only in connection with Xanthin stones in the highly dosed group, with about 11 times the exposure to humans.
The owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system as described in version 2.0 module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application is ready before the medicine is put into circulation and is available as long as the medicine is brought into circulation.
According to the CHMP Guideline, an updated RMP is preferable to risk management systems for human medicaments with the next Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR).
In addition, an update of the RMP is required • when new information is available, which have an impact on the safety data, the pharmacovigilance plan or risk minimization activities • within 60 days of reaching important milestones (pharmacovigilance or risk minimization) • on request of the EMEA
In some people uric acid accumulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that uric acid is insoluble.
If you keep the acid concentration low by 1 x daily intake of ADENURIC, the formation of crystals is prevented and in this way a reduction of the discomfort is achieved.
ADENURIC must not be taken if you are hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredient Febuxostat or any of the other components of ADENURIC.
Tell your doctor before you start taking this drug, if you have a heart weakness or have or have suffered from any other heart problem. • If you suffer from a high uric acid concentration in a result of a cancer illness or the Lesch-Nyhan-syndrome (a rare congenital disease in which too much uric acid can be found in the blood).
If you have a gout attack at the moment (sudden onset of severe pain, pressure sensitivity, redness, warmth and joint swelling), wait until the gout attack is cleared before you start treatment with ADENURIC.
This does not have to be so, but could also occur with you, especially during the first weeks of treatment or - if you are taking ADENURIC.
Your doctor will prescribe other drugs if required to prevent a gout attack or to treat the symptoms associated with it (such as pain and joint swelling).
Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / applied it, even if they are not prescription drugs.
It is particularly important that you consult your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking drugs that may appear in one of the following substances, since interactions with ADENURIC may occur and your doctor may wish to consider necessary measures. • Mercaptopurin (for the treatment of the immune defence) • Theophylline (for the treatment of asthma) • warfarin (for blood thinning for heart disease)

ADROVANCE is used to treat osteoporosis (a disease in which bones become brittle) in women after menopause where there is a risk of a low vitamin D level.
The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (no mineral water) at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements).
In order to avoid irritation of the oesophagus, the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.
As alendronate and vitamin D3 are already separated from each other in medicines approved in the European Union, the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature.
The company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of ADROVANCE in terms of increasing vitamin D levels.
After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower in patients treated with ADROVANCE (11%) than for those who only received alendronate (32%).
The company also presented data that stipulate that the alendronate dose contained in ADROVANCE is exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss.
The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are headache, pain of the musculoskeletal system (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain, dyspepsia (digestive disorders), constipation (ulcera) of the oesophagus, dysphagia (swallowing), inflated abdomen (bloated stomach) as well as acidic bumping.
In patients with allergic hypersensitivity (allergy) against alendronate, vitamin D3 or any of the other ingredients ADROVANCE may not be applied.
It may not be applied in case of diseases of the oesophagus, in patients with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes.
In January 2007, the European Commission granted Merck Sharp & Doha Ltd. to apply ADROVANCE for placing ADROVANCE across the European Union.
"" "capsular, white to broken white tablets, labelled with the outline of a bone on one side and" "" "710" "" "on the other side." ""
ADROVANCE is only available with water (not with mineral water) at least 30 minutes before the first meal, drink or intake of medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements) for the day.
Follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and associated side effects (see Section 4.4):
• ADROVANCE should only be swallowed with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) after the day. • Patients should not chew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth since there is a risk for oropharyngeal ulcera. • Patients should not lie down before the first intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.
B. peptic ulcers, active gastrointestinal bleedings or surgical interventions in the upper gastrointestinal tract except Pyloroplasty can only be given special caution (see Section 4.3).
Esophageal reactions, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcera and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by esophageal lines, were reported in patients taking alendronate (partially these were severe and required hospitalization).
The doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible esophageal reactions, and patients should be pointed out in the presence of symptoms of esophageal irritation such as dysphagia, pain in swallowing or retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn, and seek medical advice (see Section 4.8).
3 The risk of serious esophageal side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine properly and / or take it after the occurrence of symptoms that point to an esophageal irritation.
It is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient (see Section 4.2).
While in large-scale clinical trials with alendronate no increased risk was detected, stomach and duodenal ulcers were rare (after market release), among them some severe and severe complications (see Section 4.8).
Osteoarthritis of the jaw, usually associated with tooth extraction and / or a local infection (including osteomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regimen mainly contains intravenous bisphosphonates.
There are no data available indicating whether the treatment of bisphosphonate therapy in patients with a maxillary surgery reduces the risk of osteoarthritis of the jaw.
The clinical assessment by the attending physician is crucial for the treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.
Patients should be instructed that if they miss a dose ADROVANCE they should take the tablet the next morning after noticing their failure.
You should not take two tablets the same day, but should continue taking one tablet a week as originally planned on the scheduled day of the week.
Other diseases affecting the metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism) should also be treated adequately before starting treatment with ADROVANCE.
Alendronate foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids, and some oral medicines may affect the resorption of alendronate when taken at the same time.
Therefore, after taking alendronate, patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other drugs (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).
Although specific interaction studies were not carried out, Alendronate was taken in clinical trials along with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clinically relevant interactions.
ADROVANCE is only intended for use in postmenopausal women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or lactating women.
Animal studies with alendronate leave no indication of directly damaging effects in terms of pregnancy that detect embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.
Osteoarthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bisphosphonates; most reports come from cancer patients but also reported in osteoporosis patients.
However, the serum calcium intake decreased to < 8.0 mg / l (2.0 mmol / l) and the serum phosphate to ≤ 2.0 mg / l (0.65 mmol / l) in both treatment groups with similar frequency.
Alendronate Insequence of oral overdose may occur hypocalcemia, hypophosphataemia and side effects in the upper gastrointestinal tract such as stomach upset, heartburn, esophagitis, gastritis or ulcera.
Colecalciferol (vitamin D3) vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by UV light through the conversion of 7-Dehydromes to Vitamin D3.
The main effect of vitamin D3 is to increase intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate as well as the regulation of calcium and calcium, renal excretion of calcium and phosphate, bone formation and bone resorption.
In severe cases, a lack of secondary hyperparathyreoidism, hypophosphataemia, weakness of the proximal musculature and osteomalazy can lead to a further increased risk of falls and fractures in osteoporotic individuals.
Bone mineral density) on the spine or hip, the 2.5 standard deviations below the mean value for a normal, young population, or despite bone density as this pathological fracture.
Patients received ADROVANCE in lower strength (70 mg / 2,800 I.U.) (n = 350) or Fosamax (Alendronate) 70 mg once a week (n = 332); other vitamin D supplements were prohibited.
After 15 weeks of treatment, the moderate serum levels of 25-hydroxylic acid were significantly higher (26%) in the group under ADROVANCE (70 mg / 2,800 I.U.) (56 nmol / l [23 ng / ml]) than in the group under Alendronat alone (46 nmol / l [18.2 ng / ml]).
ADROVANCE (70 mg / 2,800 I.U.) significantly lowered the proportion of patients with vitamin D insufficiency after 15 weeks (serum value of 25-hydroxyprovitamin D < 37,5 nmol / l [< 15 ng / ml]) by 62,5% compared to alendronate alone (12% vs.
The therapeutic equivalent of alendronate once a week 70 mg (n = 519) and alendronate 10 mg daily (n = 370) was demonstrated in a one-year multicenter study of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.
The effects of alendronate on bone mass and fracture in postmenopausal women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design (n = 944) and in the fracture intervention study (FIT: n = 6,459).
In the phase III studies, the mean gradients of the BMD with alendronate 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.8% on the spine, 5.9% at Femurhals and 7.8% at the trochanter.
In the group treated with Alendronate, a 48% reduction (Alendronat 3.2% vs. placebo 6.2%) was achieved in comparison to placebo group (6.2%) in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more spinal fractures.
The two-year extension of these studies continued to maintain the BMD's ascents from the spine and the trochanter; the BMD of the femur and the entire body was maintained.
Fit consisted of two placebo-controlled studies where Alendronate was taken daily (5 mg. a day over 2 years and then 10 mg. daily for either 1 or 2 years):
In this study, the daily gift of alendronate reduced the occurrence of at least one new spinal fracture by 47% (Alendronat 7.9% versus placebo 15.0%).
Resorption referred to an intravenous reference dose was the mean oral bioavailability of alendronate in women 0.64% for doses ranging from 5 to 70 mg. after nocturnal fast and two hours prior to accepting a standardized breakfast.
Bioavailability decreased accordingly to about 0.46% and 0.39% when Alendronate was taken one or half an hour prior to a standardized breakfast.
In osteoporosis, alendronate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day.
In healthy subjects, oral prednisone (20 mg three times a day over five days) led to no clinically significant changes in the oral bioavailability of alendronate (increase in the range from 20% to 44%).
9 Distribution studies on rats have shown that alendronate is distributed temporarily in soft tissue after intravenous injection of 1 mg / kg, but then quickly redistributed to the bone or excreted with urine.
Excretion After intravenous administration of a single dose of 14C-alendronate, about 50% of the radioactive substances were excreted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radioactivity was found in the woods.
Following an intravenous injection of a single dose of 10 mg, the renal Clearance of Alendronat 71 ml / min and systemic Clearance did not exceed 200 ml / min.
In rats, Alendronate is not excreted via the acid or alkaline transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that it affects people excretion of other drugs through these transport systems.
Resorption In healthy adult subjects (women and men) after the application of ADROVANCE after nocturnal fast and two hours before taking a meal, the middle area under the serum concentration time curve (AUC0-120 h) for vitamin D3 296.4 ng • h / ml (without consideration of endogenous vitamin D3 mirrors).
The medium maximum concentration in serum (CMAx) of vitamin D3 was 5.9 ng / ml and the median time up to the maximum serum concentration (Tmax) 12 hours.
Biota formation vitamin D3 is rapidly hydroxyated in the liver for 25-hydroxyprovitamin D3 and then in the kidney to 1.25-dihydroxyprovitamin D3, the biologically active form, metabolized.
Excretion In case of radioactively marked vitamin D3 in healthy volunteers the average excretion of radioactivity in the urine was 2.4% in urine after 4 days 4,9%.
Characteristics in patients with preclinical studies have shown that the percentage of alendronate, which is not stored in the bone, is quickly excreted via the urine.
Although there is no clinical data available, the renal elimination of alendronate as in the animal tests can also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function.
In patients with reduced kidney function, a slightly increased accumulation of alendronate in bones is expected (see Section 4.2).
Alendronat non-clinical data based on conventional research on safety harmacology, chronic toxicity, genotoxicity and canogenic potential do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.
Rats showed that the gift of alendronate to pregnant rats was associated with the occurrence of dystoia in the maternal mortality caused by hypocalcemia.

Vitamin D3 (the amount of vitamin D3 in the higher dose of ADROVANCE) once weekly corresponds to a 24-week extension study with 619 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.
After 24 weeks of treatment, the mean serum levels of 25-hydroxylic acid were significantly higher in the 5,600-I.M. vitamin D3 group (69 nmol / l [27.6 ng / ml]) than in the 2,800-I.M. vitamin D3 group (64 nmol / l [25,5 ng / ml]).

Advagraf is administered to adult patients who have been transplanted to a kidney or liver to prevent the immune system from being repulsed by the immune system.
Since tacrolimus and Prograf / Prograft are already being used in the EU, the company has presented the results of previously carried out studies with Prograf / Prograft as well as data from published literature.
In addition, the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 668 patients with kidney transplantation, using advagraf with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin.
The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplant was rejected after one year of treatment (for example, by examining how often a new organ transplant or a resumption of dialysis was required).
In addition, further studies of 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplant were carried out and examined how advagraf is absorbed by the body compared to Prograf / Prograft.
Tremor, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (diarrhoea), kidney problems, increased blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia), diabetes, increased potassium content (hypertension), high blood pressure (hypertension) and insomnia (insomnia).
In patients with any hypersensitivity to tacrolimus, macrolide antibiotics (such as erythromycin) or any of the other ingredients, Advancf may not be applied.
Patients and doctors must be careful when others (especially some herbal) medicines should be taken at the same time with advagraf, as the Advantf dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adjusted accordingly.
Hard capsules, retards yellow-orange gelatin capsules, printed in red ink on the light yellow capsule upper part with "0.5 mg" and on the orange capsule bottom with "D647"; they contain white powder.
Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.
Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including sub- or immunosuppression.
Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formula and appropriate daily dosage; renditions of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close inspection of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Section4.4 and 4.8).
As a result of switching to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose modifications must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.
"" "the dosage of" "" "Advancf" "" "should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood level measurements (see below" "" "Recommendations" "" ")" ""
After switching from Prograf to Advancf, the tacrolimus feat mirror should be controlled before the changeover and over two weeks after adjustment.
On Day 4, systemic exposure was comparable to both kidney and liver transplanted patients.
Careful and repeated inspections of the Tacrolimus feeders are recommended during the first two weeks after transplant under Advancf to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate nightmare planing phase.
Since tacrolimus is a substance with low clearance, adjusting the advance dose can take several days before reaching the steady state.
If the patient's condition is not permitted in the first postoperative period, the Tacrolimus treatment can be administered intravenously (Prograf 5 mg / ml Concentrate to produce an infusion solution) with a dose of ca.
Duration of application In order to suppress the graft rejection, immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified.
Dose recommendations - Kidney Transplantation Prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral advance treatment should start with 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning.
Further dose adjustments may be necessary, as the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change during the course of stabilising the patient after transplantation.
Dose recommendations - Liver Transplantation Prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral advance treatment should start with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning.
Dosage recommendation - The conversion of Prograf to Advancf must be changed from Prograf capsules once daily dose of Prograf capsules to one once daily intake of advagraf, so this changeover has to take place at a ratio of 1: 1 (mg: mg), relative to the entire daily dose.
Kidney and liver transplant After switching from other immunosuppressants to advance daily, the treatment must begin with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplantation for the prophylaxis of graft rejection.
Heart transplant In adult patients who are converted to advance, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day in the morning.
Other grafts, although there is no clinical experience with advagraf in lung, pancreatic and colorectal cancer patients, was used in a oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, in pancreatic transplanted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in an oral initialdose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.
Dosage adaptations in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function For the maintenance of blood vessels in the targeted area, a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver dysfunctions.
Patients with reduced kidney function Since kidney function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not necessary.
However, due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of the serum creatine levels, a calculation of the creatine inadequacies and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.
Switch from Ciclosporin to Advancf In switching from a Ciclosporin to a tacrolimus-based therapy caution is advised (see Section4.4 and 4.5).
The recommended dose should be based primarily on the clinical appraisal of rejection and tolerability in individual cases with the help of full blood-blooded tacrolimus tests.
It is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tacrolimus levels during the first two weeks after transplant followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.
Blood-blood-blood-levels of tacrolimus should also be controlled after conversion of prograf to advagraf, dose adaptation, changes of immunosuppressive therapy or concurrent application of substances which might change the tacrolimus whole blood concentration (see section 4.5).
Since Advancf is a low-cost drug, adjustments can take several days until Steady State has entered.
The data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the levels of blood in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml.
In clinical practice, the levels of tacrolimus in the whole blood are usually in the area of 5 - 20 ng / ml and kidney transplants - and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.
During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplants, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used.
This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects, which can occur in the wake of tacrolimus under or over exposure.
Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formula and appropriate daily dosage; renditions of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close inspection of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).
5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be refractory to other immunosuppressants, no clinical data for the retardant formulation could be found.
In order to prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplants and graft recipients in childhood, no clinical data for the retardant formulation could be found.
Due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the Tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the use of herbal supplements, the St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), or other herbal remedies can be avoided during treatment with advagraf (see section 4.5).
In patients with diarrhoea an especially careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is offered, as the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.
In rare cases, an anterior chamber or septum hypertrophy referred to as cardiomyopathy was observed, which can therefore also occur under Advancf.
Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid overload and edema.
As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the potential risk of maligner skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.
If patients who are taking Tacrolimus have symptoms for PRES such as headache, altered state of consciousness, cramps and blurred vision, a radiological examination (e.g.
Since advagraf hard capsules, retardess, lactose concur, special caution is required in patients with the rare hereditary galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption.
The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies that are known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can influence the metabolism of tacrolimus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tacrolimus.
It is therefore advisable to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels while also offering substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dose for maintaining concurrent concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).
A strongly distinctive interaction was associated with antimycotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole as well as with the Macrochemical antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z).
Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the increase in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, due to the inhibition of gastrointestinal contamination.
High-dose prednisolone or methyl prednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or decrease the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.
The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4-inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous application of tacrolimus with medicines that can be metabolized by CYP3A4 can influence their metabolism.
Since tacrolimus reduce the clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increase hormone exposure, decisions about contraceptive measures should be particularly cautious.
The results of animal experiments have shown that tacrolimus potentially lessen the Clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and extend their half-life.
The results of a small number of transplant patients have no indication that under tacrolimus, compared to other immunosuppressants, there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.
In the utero exposition, a monitoring of the newborn refers to possible damaging effects of tacrolimus (especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys).
There is the risk of premature birth (< week 37) and a hyperkalemia of the newborn (incidence of 8 of 111 newborns, i.e.:
The side effect profile of immunosuppressants can often not be determined precisely because of the patient's underlying disease and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other drugs.
The side effects following their frequency are listed in descending order: very often (≥ 1 / 100, ≤ 1 / 100), sometimes (≥ 1 / 1000, ≤ 1 / 1000), very rare (≤ 1 / 10,000, ≤ 1 / 1000), very rare (≤ 1 / 10,000, ≤ 1 / 1000).

Infections and parasitic diseases How to known in other highly effective immunosuppressants is often increased in patients treated with tacrolimus, susceptibility to infections (viral, bacterial, mycotic, protozoals) frequently.
Cases of associated Nephropathy and JC-Virus associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) were reported in patients with immunosuppression therapy, including therapy with advagraf.
It was reported about benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders and skin tumors in connection with the treatment with tacrolimus.
Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding on erythrocytes and plasmaprotein, tacrolimus can not be dialyzed.
Action mechanism and pharmacodynamic effects On the molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus can be mediated by its binding to a cytosolian protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enriching the connection in the cell nucleus.
This leads to a calcium- based inhibition of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents transcription of a certain number of lymphokinks genes.
Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T-helper cells, and the formation of lymphocytes (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) as well as expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.
In the first 24 weeks of the Advancf Group (N = 237), 12 confirmed evacuation was 32.6% and 29.3% in the Prograf Group (N = 234).
Patients "survival rates after 12 months totalled 89.2% for advocacy and 90.8% for Prograf; in the Advancf arm 25 (14 women, 11 men) and Prograf arm 24 (5 women, 19 men) occurred.
Kidney transplantation The efficacy and safety of advagraf and prograf was compared in combination with mycophenolatmofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids, in 667 de novo kidney transplant recipients.
Patients "survival rates after 12 months were 96.9% for advagraf and 97.5% for Prograf; in the advance arm 10 (3 women, 7 men) and Prograf arm 8 (3 women, 5 men) occurred fatalities.
The efficacy and safety of Prograf, Ciclosporin and Advancf was compared in combination with Basiliximab antibody induction, MMF and corticosteroids, in 638 de novo kidney transplants.
The incidence of therapy failure after 12 months (defined as death, graft loss, biopsy-confirmed acute rejection or missing follow-up data) was 14.0% in the advance group (N = 214), 15.1% in the Prograf Group (N = 212) and 17.0% in the Ciclosporin Group (N = 212).
The treatment difference was -3.0% (Advagraf Ciclosporin) (95.2% confidence interval [-9.9%, 4.0%]) for advagraf vs. Ciclosporin and -1.9% (Prograf-Ciclosporin) (95.2%, 5.2%) for Prograf vs Ciclosporin.
In the Advagraf arm 3 (men), in Prograf arm 10 (3 women, 7 men) and in Ciclosporin arm 6 (3 women, 3 men) died.
Published results of primary immunosuppression with tacrolimus in the form of twice daily Prograf capsules after other primary organ transplants Prograf has developed into a recognized primary immunosuppressant after pancreatic, lung and gut transplantation.
175 patients who submitted a pancreatic transplant in 475 patients who underwent a pancreatic transplant in 630 cases as primary immunosuppressant.
Overall, the safety profile of oral Prograf was consistent with these published studies in the large studies where prograf was used for primary immunosuppression in liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients.
Lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted, multi-centric study with oral prograf was reported over 110 patients who received either tacrolimus or Ciclosporin within 1: 1 randomisation.
Chronic graft rejection, bronchiolitis obliterans- syndrome, was also observed in the first year after transplantation (2.86% versus 8.57%).
The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus and 83% in the Ciclosporin Group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).
Compared to 38.0% under Ciclosporin (p = 0.025), patients treated with tacrolimus were in 21,7% of cases for the emergence of a bronchiolitis obliterans.
The number of cases in which Ciclosporin had to be converted to Tacrolimus (n = 0.02) was significantly greater (p = 0.02) than the number of patients who were converted by Tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).
The number of cases in which there was no acute rejection rate was greater after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the treatment plan patients of the Tacrolimus group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).
In one study, the frequency of the onset of a bronchiolitis obliteric syndrome in the patients treated with tacrolimus was significantly lower.
A multi-centric study with oral Prograf was carried out to 205 patients who underwent a pancreas and kidney transplantation, who received Tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102) after a randomised procedure.
The oral initial dose (per protocol) of Tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.
The published clinical results of a monocentric study of oral prograf as primary immunosuppressant after colorimtransplants showed an up-to-date survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.
Methods for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) and CMV infections, bone marrow enlargement, additional administration of the interleukin-2 antagonist Daclizumab, lower initial doses ranging from 10 to 15 ng / ml and recently transplant radiation (Abu-Elmagde et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).
Factors such as low haematocrit and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the unbound group of tacrolimus or a strengthening of metabolism induced by corticosteroids are to be responsible for higher clearing rates observed after the transplant.
This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, with excretion predominantly via the bile.
The systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) under Advancf was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf in case of stable patients (once daily) in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg) compared to the total daily dose.
It is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tacrolimus levels during the first two weeks after transplant followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.
21 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be refractory to other immunosuppressants, no clinical data for the retardant formulation could be found.
Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid overload and edema.
In the first 24 weeks of the Advancf Group (N = 237), 28 confirmed evacuation was 32.6% and 29.3% in the Prograf Group (N = 234).
The efficacy and safety of Prograf, Ciclosporin and Advancf was compared in combination with Basiliximab antibody induction, MMF and corticosteroids, in 638 de novo kidney transplants.

The efficacy and safety of Prograf, Ciclosporin and Advancf was compared in combination with Basiliximab antibody induction, MMF and corticosteroids, in 638 de novo kidney transplants.
In total, 34 patients of Ciclosporin were converted to Tacrolimus, while only 6 patients needed another therapy (Bechstein et al., Transplantation 2004; 77: 1221).
The published clinical results of a monocentric study of oral prograf as primary immunosuppressant after colorimtransplants showed an up-to-date survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.

Lawyers are used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (caused by the lack of factor VIII, congenital blood clotting disorder).
Dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether lawyers are used to treat bleedings or to prevent bleedings in surgical procedures.
Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.
Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but is produced using a method called recombinant DNA technology:
It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced into which it enables the formation of the human coagulation factor VIII.
Advate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Recombinate, but it is otherwise produced so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin.
In three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study of 53 children under six years, the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and for surgical procedures.
The main study evaluated the efficacy of advates in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new bleeding episodes with "excellent" or "good."
The most common side effects of advates (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.
Advance may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other ingredients.
In March 2004, the European Commission granted the company Baxter AG a permit for the placing of lawyers in the entire European Union.
Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of VIII deficiency, the location and extent of the hemorrhage and the clinical condition of the patient.
In the following hemorrhagic events the factor VIII activity should not fall under the indicated plasma level (in% of the standard or in I.U. / dl) during the corresponding period of time.
Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impairment are removed.
Repeat every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk is over for the patient.
In the course of treatment, a proper determination of VIII plasma levels is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of injections.
Individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and have different half-value times.
3 Prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses of 20 to 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg of body weight within 2-3 days.
If the expected Factor VIII plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibitor if necessary.
In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures need to be considered.
The dose should be directed at the patient's level, with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.
The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.
These inhibitors are always against the prokoagulatory activity of factor VIII IgG immunoglobulins quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma with modified Bethesda Assay.
The risk of inhibiting inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to VIII, where the risk is greatest within the first 20 exposure days and depends on genetic and other factors.
In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and anamnesian well-known inhibitor development, after switching from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, reoccurrence of (low triggering) inhibitors was observed.
Due to the rare occurrence of hemophilia A in women there is no experience about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.
ADRs were inhibitors to VIII (5 patients), all of which occurred in previously untreated patients who exhibit higher risk of inhibiting, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).
Very common (≥ 1 / 100 to < 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000 to < 1 / 1000), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000 to < 1 / 1000), very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to < 1 / 1000), not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).
A) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the sum of the individual patients (234) The unexpected drop of the coagulation factor VIII-mirror occurred postoperatively (10th - 14th postoperative day) in a patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.
Blood clotting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VIII- Spiegel in the plasma and the Clearance rate showed adequate values again on the 15th day of the day.
In clinical trials with ADVATE on 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy to moderate hepophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and prior exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days) only one patient showed a low inhibitor type (2.4 B.E. in modified Bethesda approach) after 26 expositions with ADVATE.
In addition, none of the 53 Pediatric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed with severe or moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) were observed with VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days) a FVIII inhibitor.
In previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical trial 5 out of 25 (20%) treated patients treated with ADVATE treated inhibitors against factor VIII.
The immune response of patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody titer against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.
A patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as sustained peak of the antibody-level against anti-CHO cell protein, otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicated on an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.
In four patients the presence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophiles granulocytes was reported in several repeated product expositions within the study.
7 As with other intravenous products, ADVATE reports about hypersensitivity reactions of allergic type, including anaphylactic / anaphylaictoid reactions (frequency unknown).
The activated Factor VIII acts as a co-factor for the activated Factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X from factor X.
All pharmacokinetical studies with ADVATE were performed on previously treated patients with severe or moderate haemophilia A (baseline of factor VIII-activity ≤ 2%).
The pharmacokinetic parameters stem from a cross-over study with ADVATE in 100 previously treated patients or > 10 years and are listed in table 3 below.

Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP still rated the benefit-risk assessment as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:
Therefore, the CHMP has decided on the basis of ADVATE's safety profile, which makes PSURs mandatory every 6 months, and decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years.
In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited submitted the CHMP to the Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company withdraws its application for the transfer of lawyer to Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.
Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissue (tissue that connects and supports other structures in the body) is affected.
This is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body.
The virus in advexin is a "Adenovirus," which has been modified in such a way that it cannot produce copies of oneself and thus can cause infections in humans.
Advexin could have been injected directly into the tumors, enabling the cancer cells to reconstruct the normal p53 protein.
The p53 protein, which is formed from the p53 gene that is not defective in the human body, usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered.
With Li-Fraumeni-Cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.
The company presented data from a study with a patient with Li-Fraumeni-Cancer performed in the area of the abdomen, bones and brain.
After the CHMP reviewed the company's responses to the questions asked, some questions were still unclear.
Based on the review of the documents submitted, the CHMP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120.
According to the CHMP, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of adva in Li-Fraumeni-Tumour provides benefits for patients.
The committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.
In addition, the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is not harmful to the environment or for people who come in close contact with the patient.
The company did not inform the CHMP whether the withdrawal will have consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or "compassionate-use" programs with advin.
"" "" "" "altered drug release" "" "means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is immediately released and the other slowly releases over a few hours." ""
Aeronaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation caused by allergies to pollen) in patients with nasal mucous swelling (clogged nose).
For adults and adolescents 12 years old, the recommended dose of Aerofaze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.
The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are cloned.
Treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug may be reduced to the constipation of the nose.
The main efficacy measurements were the changes in severity of hay fever symptoms recorded by patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.
During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.
In consideration of all hayfever symptoms except constipation of the nose, the patients receiving Aeronaze reported a 46.0% decrease in symptoms compared to 35.9% in patients who had pseudoephedrine alone.
If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients showed a reduction of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who took desloratadin alone.
The most common side effects of averages (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chasing), dryness, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (insomnia), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.
Aeronaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to loratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or Loratadin (another drug for treating allergies).
It may not be applied to patients suffering from an angle glaucoma (elevated intraocular pressure), hyperthyroidism (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hyperthyroidism), hyperthyroidism (hypertension caused by cerebral thrombosis) or have a risk of a hemorrhagic stroke.
On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a licence for the transfer of Aeronaze to the entire European Union.
The tablet can be taken with a glass of water but can be swallowed whole (i.e. without tearing it up, breaking or chewing).
Aeronaze should not be used for children under the age of 12 due to the lack of data on harmlessness and efficacy (see Section 5.1).
The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have stopped.
It is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days, as long-term application can reduce the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.
After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment may be continued with Desloratadin as a monotherapy.
Da Aeriniaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within the 2 weeks after the completion of such a therapy.
This is due to the alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, peregotamine, dihydroergotamine or other deconjunctiva, which can be intraorally or nasal than thresholds of Rhinoplasty (phenylpropane, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, naphazolin etc.).
The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not been checked for this patient's collective and the data is not sufficient to address recommendations for the dosage.
Safety and efficacy of Aeronaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is insufficient to address recommendations for dosage.
Patients must be informed that the treatment in case of hypertonia or tachycardia or palpitations, arrhythmias, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or augmentation of the headaches) must be stopped.
Caution is advised in the treatment of the following patient groups: • Patients with cardiac arrhythmias • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck obstruction or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.
Aeronaze is to be replaced at least 48 hours prior to performing dermatological testing, as antihistamines can otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or to reduce them to their extent.
In the course of clinical tests with Desloratadin, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered in addition, no clinically relevant interactions or changes of the plasma concentration of Desloratadin were observed.
In the results of the psychomotor testing no significant differences could be found between patients treated with Desloratadin and the patients treated with placebo, regardless of whether or not they were taken alone or with alcohol.
The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded.
Desloratadin does not inhibit in vivo CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.
The harmlessness of the use of aerosols during pregnancy is not guaranteed, but experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies did not result in an increase in the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.
As reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerobaze should not be applied during pregnancy.
However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a lightheadedness, which can lead to impairment of the ability of transport or the ability to operate machinery.
The symptoms may vary between a CNS-depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible nasal processes.
Headache, anxiety, panic disorder, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, breathing insufficiency, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, precordiale pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, blurred vision and hypertension or hypotonia.
A CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (mouthdry, pupil rigidity and - dilation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).
These include the inhibition of the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of expression of the adhesion molecules P-seless to endothelial cells.
In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the gliding, including amplification of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.
In controlled clinical trials, at the recommended dosage of 5 mg. daily, no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo was determined.
The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause other sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestations of CNS arousal.
There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving Aeronaze tablets.
In both studies, the histamine antagonistic effectiveness of aze tablets, determined by the overall score for the symptoms (except nasal mucosal swelling), was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.
The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the wavering effect, determined by the nasal mucosal swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.
The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets did not show significant differences with regard to patient subsets defined by gender, age or ethnicity.
As part of a single dose study on pharmacokinetics by Aerinaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes of the administration of the plasma.
After the peroral application of aerobaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days, the flow equivalent weight of desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached by day 10.
Within the framework of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, four subjects of Desloratadin were badly metabolised.
A component interaction study shows that the exposition (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the exclusive gift of pseudoephedrine is equivalent to exposure to the application of an aerofaze tablet.
However, based on conventional safety harmacology studies, toxicity in repeated application, neurotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data with Desloratadin however do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.
The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient Pseudoephedrine.
In reproductive toxicological studies the combination of Loratadin / pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rabbits at a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.
March 2007 and the Pharmacovigilance system described in module 1.8.1 of the approval application is established and works before and while the product is on the market.
Antihistamines contribute to the relief of allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance, to develop its effect.
Aze tablets relieve symptoms that occur in connection with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), such as sneezing, running or itchy nose and tearing or itchy eyes while constipating the nose.
20. under certain circumstances, you may be particularly sensitive to the mucous membrane of the pseudoephedrine, which is contained in this medicine.
(diabetes), a stenositive gastric ulcer (ulcer which leads to a narrowing of stomach, small intestine or oesophagus), a bladder neck clasp, bronchospasm in the medical history (shortness of breath due to a cramp of the lung musculature), a prostate enlargement or problems with the liver, kidneys or bladder.
Tell your doctor if you are experiencing or diagnosing the following symptoms or diseases when using Aerobaze: • High blood pressure • Cardiac disease, palpitations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headaches or strengthening of existing headaches.
Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other drugs or have recently taken, even if they are non-prescription drugs.
When applying at the recommended dosage, it is not to be expected that Aeronaze will lead to lightheadedness or reduce the attention.
If you have taken a larger amount of Aerinaze than you should inform immediately your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken a larger amount of Aerobaze than you should.
If you forgot to take a dose of Aerinaze If you forgot to take a dose in time, take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the appropriate time.
Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed adverse events affect you significantly or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information.
Heart hunting, restlessness with increased physical activity, dry mouth, dizziness, sore throat, loss of appetite, constipation, sugar in the urine, increased blood sugar levels, thirst, fatigue, headache, sleep disorders, nervousness and dizziness.
Heart palpitations or cardiac arrhythmias, increased physical activity, redness, nasal bleeding, confusion, blurred vision, nasal irritation, nasal infection, nasal sinus, nasal irritation, nasal sinus, nasal sinus, nausea, loss of gastric, loss of odor, noticeable liver values, anxiety, anxiety and irritability.
After the market launch of Desloratadin very rarely was reported about cases of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives rash and swelling) or rash.
Cases of palpitations, heart hunting, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, sleep disorders, muscle pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, cases of liver inflammation and cases of notable liver enzymes were also rarely reported.
It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg lyophilisate for intake (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg / ml syrup (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake.
For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day, in the form of 2.5 ml syrup and respectively.
For children between the ages of six and eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once daily, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or.
Aerius was examined in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies of patients who had asthma).
Efficacy was measured by determining the symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadrant, impairment of sleep and performance in the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.
Further studies have been presented to demonstrate that the body utilizes the syrup, the solution for intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe.
In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius resulted in an average decrease in symptom scores (symptom points) by 25 to 32% compared to the decrease in 12 to 26% in patients receiving a placebo.
In the two trials of Urticaria the decrease in the symptom was after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% compared to 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.
Erius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to loratadin, lauatadin or any of the other components.
In January 2001, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a licence for the placing of Aerius in the entire European Union.
One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see under Section 5.1).
There is limited experience from clinical studies to efficacy in the use of desloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).
The treatment of allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the previous disease course and can be terminated after the symptoms have been completed and resumed at their reoccurring.
In case of allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks), the patient may be advised during the allergy period.
Clinically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical trials with Desloratadin tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see under Section 5.1).
In a clinical pharmacological study, while taking Aerius and alcohol, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased (see under Section 5.1).
However, patients should be informed that, in very rare cases, it can lead to drowsiness, which can lead to impairment of the transport capacity or the ability to operate machinery.
In clinical trials in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported in patients with Aerius at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with placebo.
The most common adverse events reported in placebo were fatigue (1,2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).
In a clinical study with 578 young patients aged between 12 and 17 years, the most common adverse event was headache, which occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadin and 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.
No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study that was administered up to 45 mg.
This includes both the inhibition of the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibiting the expression of the adhesion molecules P-seless to endothelial cells.
No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effects were described as part of a clinical study with multi-dose boxes in which desloratadin was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg. a day for 14 days.
In a clinical pharmacological study in which desloratadin was administered in a dose of 45 mg. a day (the Neunfold of the Clinical dosage) for more than ten days, no extension of the Qtc interval indicated itself.
In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the gliding, including amplification of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.
In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tear flow, and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.
In addition to the established asisonal and perennial classification, allergic rhinitis can alternatively be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis depending on the duration of symptoms.
Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.
Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.
As was demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.
The chronically idiopathic urticaria was examined for further forms of the Urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology despite the etiology of the different forms is similar and chronic patients can be easily prospectively recruited.
Since histamine is a causative factor in all cosmetic diseases, it is expected that Desloratadin results in an improvement of the symptoms in other forms of the urticaria in other forms of the urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.
In two placebo-controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and the reduction of size and number of noodles at the end of the first dose interval.
As in other studies with antihistaminika in chronically idiopathic urticaria the minority of patients who did not respond to antihistamines were excluded from the study.
An improvement of the itching rate by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with Desloratadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.
The treatment with Aerius significantly reduced the disturbance of sleep and wakefulness, as measured by a 4-point scale to evaluate these variables.
In a pharmacokinetic study comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients achieved a higher concentration of Desloratadin.
There are no indications for clinically relevant cumulation after once daily use of Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) for 14 days.
However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other drugs are not entirely excluded.
Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.
In a single dose study with desloratadin at a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of Desloratadin.
The preclinical studies carried out with Desloratadin and Loratadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxicity profile of Desloratadin and Loratadin.
Based on conventional research on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated dose, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data with Desloratadin reveal no particular dangers to humans.
Color film (contains lactose-monohydrate, Hypromellose, Titandioxid, Macrogol 400, Indigocarmin (E 132)), colourless film (contains Hypromellose, Macrogol 400), Carnauba wax, bleached wax.
Aerius can be taken independently of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see under Section 5.1).
The prescribing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that there is no data available to support an infectious rhinitis with Aerius.
In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, the diagnosis of anamnesis, physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role.
About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolize Desloratadin and experience a higher level of substance (see under section 5.2).
The safety of Aerius Sirup in children between 2 and 11 years that limit metabolize is identical to that of children who metabolise normally.
This medicine contains saccharose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption or sucrose isomaltas- insufficiency should not take this medicine.
Clinically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with Aerius tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see under Section 5.1).
In a clinical pharmacological study, while taking Aerius tablets and alcohol, alcohol has not increased the performance-reducing effect of alcohol (see under Section 5.1).
The overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius Sirup group as in the placebo group.
In clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.
No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study involving adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg.
Children aged between 1 and 11 who were eligible for anti-histamine treatment received a daily dose of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).
Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronically idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadin in adults and children are similar, the efficacy data of Desloratadin in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.
No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effects were described as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which desloratadin was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg. a day for 14 days.
In a clinical pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in which desloratadin was used in a dose of 45 mg daily (the Neunfold of the Clinical dosage) for ten days in adults, no extension of the Qtc interval indicated itself.
In controlled clinical trials, the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents showed no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo.
In a single-day dose of 7.5 mg Aerius tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not interfere with psychomotor skills.
In clinical pharmacological studies in adults, the simultaneous consumption of alcohol did not result in amplification of the alcohol-induced deterioration of the performance or an increase in drowsiness.
In adults and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tear flow, and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.
As demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets effectively reduce the induced seasonal rhinitis
In two placebo-controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and the reduction of size and number of noodles at the end of the first dose interval.
The spread of this limited metabolic phenotype was comparable in adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations greater in blacks (18% adults, 16% children) than with Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).
Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multidose study involving syrup formation in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis that limit metabolize.
The strain (AUC) by Desloratadin was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the CMAx was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half-life of about 120 hours.
There are no indications of clinically relevant drug accumulation after once daily use of Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) for 14 days in adults and adolescents.
12 In various single dose studies, AUC and CMAx values of desloratadin were comparable with pediatric patients at the recommended doses compared to those of adults who received desloratadin syrup in a dose of 5 mg.
However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded.
Aerius Sirup is available in type III bracing bottles with a child-safe polypropylene cap with 30, 50, 60, 100, 120, 150, 225 and 300 ml.
Equipped with a rigid, transparent polystyrene measuring scoop, calibrated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with an application syringe for preparation for application with scaling ranging from 2.5 ml to 5 ml (only for the 150 ml bottle).
A dose of Aerius Lyophilisate to be taken once a day to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see under Section 5.1).
Immediately before application, the blister has to be carefully opened and the dose of lyophilisate can be taken from taking without damaging it.
Clinically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with Aerius tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally applied (see under Section 5.1).
In clinical trials in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for patients with Aerius tablets than in patients treated with placebo.
No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study involving up to 45mg of desloratadin (ninefold clinical dosage).
In two single dose studies, Aerius Lyophilisate was well tolerated by clinical laboratory results, medical examinations, vital signs and ECG interval data.
No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effects were described as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of up to 20 mg. a day in a dose of up to 20 mg. a day for 14 days.
In a clinical pharmacological study in which desloratadin was used in a dose of 45 mg. a day (the Neunfold of the Clinical dosage) for more than ten days, no extension of the Qtc interval indicated itself.
In controlled clinical trials, at the recommended dosage of 5 mg. daily, no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo was determined.
In a 17-dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the gliding, including amplification of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.
In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tear flow, and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.
As was demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.
18 In a pharmacokinetic study comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients achieved a higher concentration of Desloratadin.
Food does not have a significant influence on AUC and CMAx of Aerius Lyophilisate, while food Tmax is extended from 2.5 to 4 hours and Tmax of 3-OH-Desloratadin from 4 to 6 hours.

Put an Aerius 2.5 mg of melted tablet once a day to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see under Section 5.1).
Two Aerius 2.5 mg of melting tablets daily put in the mouth to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see under Section 5.1).
There is limited experience from clinical studies to efficacy in the use of desloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).
Immediately before application, the blister has to be carefully opened and the dose of the melt tablet is removed without damaging it.
The efficacy and harmlessness of Aerius 2.5 mg of melting tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years has not been proven until now.
The overall incidence of adverse events between the placeboatadine syrup and the placebo group was the same and did not significantly decrease the safety profile established in adult patients.
At the recommended dose, Aerius's crucible tablet proved to be a bioequivalent to the Aerius 5 mg conventional tablet formulation and the Aerius 5 mg lyophilisate to the nehmen- formulation of Desloratadin.
In the framework of a clinical study with multi-dose boxes in which Desloratadin was used in a dose of up to 20 mg. daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically significant
In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the gliding, including amplification of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.
The spread of this badly metabolizing phenotype was comparable to adults (6%) and pediatric patients between 2 and 11 years (6%), and among blacks (adults 18%, children 16%) larger than with Caucasians (Awakse 2%, children 3%), however, the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population.
In single dose-crossover studies of Aerius melt tablet with Aerius 5 mg conventional tablets or Aerius 5 mg lyophilisate for intake, the formulations were bioequivalent.
Aerius 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pediatric patients, but in conjunction with the dose-finding studies in children, the pharmacokinetic data for Aerius melting trays support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years.
Food does not have a significant influence on AUC and CMAx of Aerius Aerius Lyophilisate, while food Tmax is extended from 2.5 to 4 hours and Tmax of 3-OH- Desloratadin from 4 to 6 hours.
The overall analysis of preclinical and clinical irritation tests for the melt tablet indicated that this formulation is an unlikely risk for local irritations in clinical applications.

Put an Aerius 5 mg of melt tablet once a day to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see under Section 5.1).
At the recommended dose, Aerius 5 mg of processed tablet proved to be a bioequivalent to the Aerius 5 mg conventional tablet formulation and the Aerius 5 mg lyophilisate to the nehmen- formulation of Desloratadin.
No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effects were described as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of up to 20 mg. a day in a dose of up to 20 mg. a day for 14 days.
In a 30-dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the gliding, including amplification of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.
In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tear flow, and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.
In single dose-crossover studies of Aerius 5 mg processed tablet with Aerius 5 mg conventional tablets or Aerius 5 mg lyophilisate for intake, the formulations were bioequivalent.
The overall analysis of preclinical and clinical irritation tests for the melt tablet indicated that this formulation is an unlikely risk for local irritations in clinical applications.
The safety of desloratadin in children between 2 and 11 years, which are metabolised, is identical to that of children who metabolise normally.
This medicine contains sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption or sucrose isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.
The overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to that of the Placebo group.
The most common adverse events reported in small children between 6 and 23 months were diarrhoea (3.7%), fever (2.3%) and sleeplessness (2.3%).
In an additional study, at a one-time dose of 2.5 mg of Desloratadin, no side effects were observed in patients between 6 and 11 years of age.
At the recommended doses, the plasma concentrations of Desloratadin (see under section 5.2) were comparable in the children's and adult population.
In controlled clinical trials, the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents showed no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo.
In addition to the established zasonal and perennial classification, allergic rhinitis may alternatively also occur in intermittent allergic rhinitis depending on the duration of symptoms.
As demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets effectively reduce the strain caused by seasonal or allergic rhinitis.
The spread of this limited metabolic phenotype was comparable in adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations greater in blacks (18% adults, 16% children) than with Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).
Since Aerius's solution to intake contains the same concentration of desloratadin, no organic equivalence study was required and it is expected that it corresponds to syrup and tablets.
In a number of single dose studies, AUC and CMAx values of desloratadin were comparable with pediatric patients at the recommended doses compared to those of adults who received desloratadin syrup in a dose of 5 mg.

June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. once approved the CHMP Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company withdraws its application for the prevention of aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.
Aflunov should be used in adults and older people to protect against influenza caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of influenza A virus.
This is a special type of vaccine meant to protect against a strain of the flu virus causing a future pandemic.
A flu pandemic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from human to human, because humans have not yet built up immunity.
After administering the vaccine, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as "foreign" and forms antibodies against it.
As a result, the immune system will later be able to form antibodies using a flu virus.
"" "subsequently, the" "" "surface antigens" "" "membrane (proteins on the membrane surface, which the human body recognises as a body externally), was purified and used as part of the vaccine." ""
A survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the "Good Clinical Practice" (GCP).
As a result, the scope of the clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for prepandemic vaccines.
If you are taking part in a clinical trial and need further information on your treatment, please contact your attending physician.
If you would like more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).
It is used in combination with other antiviral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years, which are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus of type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Avalase is available as a solution for intake, but it cannot be taken together with ritonavir since the safety of this combination has not been studied.
Avalet should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked out which antiviral drugs the patient has previously taken, and the likelihood of the virus will respond to the medicine.
The recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily, taken together with twice daily 100 mg ritonavir and other antiviral medicines.
For children between four and twelve years old and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Avalase is based on body weight.
In combination with other antiviral drugs, Avalase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level.
AIDS cannot cure, but can delay the damage to the immune system and also the development of AIDS-related infections and diseases.
Agenerase was investigated in combination with other antiviral drugs, but without knight avir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had not previously been treated with protease inhibitors.
It was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who used to use protease inhibitors in 206 adults who had previously taken protease inhibitors.
The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in viral load after treatment.
In studies with patients who had not previously taken protease inhibitors, more patients had less than 400 copies / ml than placebo after 48 weeks, but Avalase was less effective than indinavir.
In children, Agenera also reduced the viral load, but the children who had previously been treated with ease inhibitors only responded very few to the treatment.
In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the medicine Avalase reinforced with ritonavir increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:
In the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, Agenerase together with Ritonavir came to a stronger decrease in viral load after four weeks compared to patients who continued to take up their previous protease inhibitors:
The most common side effects of aphorism (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (bloating), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue.
2 / 3 Agenase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other components.
Agrease may also not be used in patients who are taking Johanniskraut (an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or drugs that are broken down as well as agrease and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood.
As with other drugs against HIV, there is a risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteoarthritis (loss of bone tissue) or an immune reactivation syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the rejuvenating immune system).
The Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that in combination with other antiretroviral drugs used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs to treat protease inhibitors, HIV-1 infected adults and children outweigh the risks for more than four years.
Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the benefit of aggregation in combination with ritonavir in patients who have not previously taken protease inhibitors has not been proven.
"" "Agenerase was originally approved in" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""
In October 2000, the European Commission granted the Company Glaxo Group Limited a permit for the placing of ads across the European Union.
Avalase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) previously treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.
Amprenavir should usually be administered for pharmacokinetic boosters of amprenavir together with low doses of ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).
The use of amprenavir should take place taking account of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre-treatment of the patient (see Section 5.1).
The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than from amprenavir as capsule; hence, Avalase capsules and solution for gaining on a milligram per milligram basis are not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).
The recommended dose for Avalase capsules is 600 mg amprenavir twice daily along with 100 mg ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.
2 If Avalase capsules are used without the intensifying addition of ritonavir (booster), higher doses of Avalase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.
The recommended dose for Avalase capsules is 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).
Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of aggregation in combination with low doses of ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not studied in children.
Agrease is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age, due to the lack of data on harmlessness and efficacy (see Section 5.2).
Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Avalase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function problems to 300 mg twice daily.
The simultaneous application should be done with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunctions it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).
"" "" "" "Ageneric" "" "may not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic latitude and also present substrates of the cytochrome P450 Isoenzymatic 3A4 (CYP3A4)." ""
Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amprenavir while taking amprenavir (see section 4.5).
The patients should be pointed out that apgeneric or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.
The current antiretroviral therapy, including the treatment with aspirin, does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.
Usually, Agenerative capsules should be used together with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see section 4.2).
Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver-side effects with potentially fatal outcome.
In the event of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine.
Patients with pre-existing liver function including chronic-active hepatitis show increased frequency of liver dysfunction under antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.
The simultaneous use of Avalase and ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolized via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see section 4.5).
Since the metabolism of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is highly dependent on CYP3A4, an simultaneous administration of apprease with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended due to the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.
4 For some drugs that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under the supervision of the International Regised Ratio), methods for determining the drug concentration are available.
In patients who are taking these drugs at the same time, asparase may be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of amprenavir (see section 4.5).
Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, but the information is insufficient to assess the type of interactions.
If methadone is given at the same time with amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored for withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of ritonavir are also administered.
Because of the potential risk of toxicity due to the high level of propylene glycol content, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient populations.
If a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).
Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.
Many of the patients had other illnesses whose therapy needed medicines to be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.
B. Higher age, and associated with drug-dependent factors, such as prolonged anti-retroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.
In hemophile patients (type A and B) treated with ease inhibitors, reports on an increase of bleedings including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and haemarthrosis occur.
In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can develop at the time of initiating an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), leading to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.
Although multifactorial etiology is assumed (including corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index) cases of osteoarthritis in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term treatment of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) were reported.
CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic latitude must not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic latitude and also present substrates of the cytochrome P450 Isoenzymatic 3A4 (CYP3A4).
CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Avalase with ritonavir may not be combined with drugs whose active ingredients are metabolized via CYP2D6 and are associated with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.
It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of amprenavir, which can lead to virological failure and resistance development.
In the attempt to compensate the reduced plasma levels by a dose-increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with ritonavir, adverse effects on the liver were observed.
St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of amprenavir can be degraded by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).
If one patient already takes St. John's wort, the amprenavirus levels and, if possible, check the viral load and replace the St. John's wort.
Dose adjustment for one of the drugs is not required when nelfinavir is administered together with amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).
508% increased, for CMAx, by contrast, reduced by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).
In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg amprenavir were used twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day, demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment plan.
52% lower when amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was given in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily).
The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma, which were achieved in the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg ritonavir.
Dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, a close monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and safety of this combination is not known.
There was no pharmacokinetic study on the use of didanosine in combination with didanosine, however, due to the antazidi component of didanosine, it is recommended that the revenues of didanosin and aspirin are at least one hour apart (see antazida below).
Therefore, in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adjustment is required.
Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure to both protease inhibitors would decrease.
The effect of Nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapin may reduce the serum concentration of amprenavir.
If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is advised as Delavirdin might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.
Caution is advised if these drugs are used together; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring is to be carried out, since precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir on Delavirine is difficult.
The simultaneous administration of amprenavir and rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) of Rifabutin by 193%, resulting in an increase in side effects associated with Rifabutin.
If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin along with Avalase, a reduction in the dose of rifabutin should be at least half the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available for this.
Pharmacokinetic studies with aggregation in combination with erythromycin have not been performed, however, the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of concurrent administration.
Simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg ritonavir with 200 mg ketoconazole once daily led to an increase of CMAx of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) compared to the value that was observed once a day without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.
Other drugs listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or CYP3A4, can potentially lead to interactions if they are used together with Avalase.
Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with Avalase.
Based on the data of other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as Avalase as it can come to resorption insomnia.
The simultaneous use of anticonvulsants known as enzyme ductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir can lead to degradation of the plasma levels of amprenavir.
Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, anisoldipine and verapamil can be increased 10 by amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these drugs.
Simultaneous ingestation with Avalase can significantly increase the plasma concentrations and intensify the effects associated with PDE5 inhibitors, including hypotension, blurred vision and priapism (see Section 4.4).
In a clinical study in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels rose by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).
As a result, the simultaneous administration of Avalase with Ritonavir together with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see Section 4.4).
In the case of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases in plasma levels are to be expected in simultaneous administration of aphorism.
Since plasma levels of these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of these drugs with amprenavir is not recommended.
More frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of the mirror is recommended, as the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased with the simultaneous administration of amprenavir (see Section 4.4).
Therefore, Avalet may not be used together with orally taken Midazolam (see Section 4.3), while caution is advised with parenteral Midazolam concurrently.
Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma level of Midazolam by 3 to 4 times.
If methadone is administered together with amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored for withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of ritonavir are also administered.
Because of the low reliability of historic comparisons there is no recommendation at the moment, as the amprenavirus dose can be adjusted if amprenavir is given at the same time with methadone.
With the simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Avalase, increased control of INR (International Regised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).
The effect of an additional administration of ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore alternative methods for contraception are also recommended.
Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended with concurrent asgeneracy (see Section 4.4).
During pregnancy, this medicine may only be used after careful balancing of the possible benefits to the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.
In the lactose-free rats, amprenavir related substances have been detected, but it is not known whether or not amprenavir is transferred to breast milk.
A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was administered by the loss in the uterus to the end of the breastfeeding time of amprenavir, showed a diminished 12 body weight during lactation.
The further development of posterity, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not affected by the administration of amprenavir to the maternal animal.
The harmlessness of aGenase was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.
Most side effects associated with the treatment of Agenase were mild to moderate, rose early and rarely led to a treatment break.
Many of these events are not clarified whether they are in connection with taking Avalor or another drug at the same time, or whether they are a result of the underlying disease.
Most of the side effects mentioned below stem from two clinical studies (PROAB3001, PROAB3006) in which patients with protease inhibitors received 1200 mg Avalase twice daily.
Events (grade 2 to 4), which were assessed by the investigators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as laboratory changes occurring during the treatment (Grade 3 to 4) are listed.
Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of the body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and facial subretinal fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fatty tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorso@-@ cervical fat accumulation.
Among 113 antiretroviral non-treated individuals who had been treated with amprenavir in combination with Lamivudin / Zidovudine over a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (bulldocks) (< 1%) was observed.
In the study PROAB 3006, 245 NRTIs were treated with amprenavir 7 cases (3%) in 241 patients (11%) in 241 patients with indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs for an average duration of 56 weeks (p < 0.001).
Cutaneous rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or macroscous nature, with or without itching, and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with amprenavir had to be aborted.
Cases of osteoarthritis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term treatment of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).
In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can develop at the time of initiating an antiretroviral combination therapy (see Section 4.4).
With PI pretreated patients receiving 600 mg Avalase twice a day with low dosed ritonavir (Grade 3 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4), which were observed in patients who received Avalase together with low dosed ritonavir, were often observed.
In case of overdose, the patient may be exposed to signs of intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary, necessary supportive measures can be initiated.
Amprenavir binds to the active centre of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the processing of viral gag- and gag-pole- polyproteins with the result of a formation of unripe, non infectious viral particles.
The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro vs HIV-1 IIIB was studied in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.
The 50% Hemp Concentration (IC50) of amprenavir is in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM with acutely infected cells and is 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells
The connection between the activity of amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.
In the treatment antiretroviral non-treated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages were treated - as with other Ritonavir geboosterten treatment schemes with protease inhibitors - the mutations described are rarely observed.
In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral non-pretreated patients receiving 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg Ritonavir twice a day in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred until week 48, whereby 14 isolates could be genotypically examined.
Genotypic analysis of 13 of 14 children in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 patients, with protease inhibitors not pre-treated patients, showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.
L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M36I, M46I / L, I47V, D60E, I50V, A71V, V77I, V82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.
In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamprenavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) patients treated with protease inhibitors occurred over 96 weeks, following protease inhibitors:
Genotypic resistance testing based analyses can be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / knight onavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.
The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I62V, V82A / C / F / F, I84V and L90M in conjunction with an increased phenotypic resistance to Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir and a reduced likelihood of virological response (resistance).
The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutational patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for analysing the results of resistance tests.
Based on phenotypic resistance testing, clinically validated phenotypic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with genotypic data to estimate the activity of amprenavir / knight onavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.
Firms that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically phenotypic cut-offs (isolating points) for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.
Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to amprenavir associated genetic patterns generates a certain cross resistance against ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.
There are currently data on cross resistance between amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance trails, either alone or in combination with other mutations.
On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral non-pretreated patients in which a Fosamprenavirus (containing three of 25 isolates), Darunavir / Ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), Lopinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three of 24 isolates), and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates) appear.
Conversely, amprenavir maintains its activity against some other protease inhibitors-resistant isolates; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.
The early departure of any therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mutations that may have a detrimental effect on subsequent treatment.
The evidence of the efficacy of Ageneracy in combination with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study, in which PI pre-treated adults (100 mg twice daily) and Nucleosidanaloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly braised with low-dosed ritonavir.
One hundred and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Avalase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the partial study A of PRO30017.
The primary analysis revealed the non-inferiority of APV / Ritonavir in comparison with the SOC-PI group in the virus load (HIV-1 RNA) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-inflow threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.
The evidence of the efficacy of unbridled astgeneracy is based on two uncontrolled trials involving a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were previously treated with PI.
In the studies Ageneric solution for intake and capsules in dosages of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily.
No low dose of ritonavir was given at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs associated with Avalase.
After 48 weeks approximately 25% of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration < 10,000 copies / ml and 9% < 400 copies / ml in median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to baseline.
"" "19 Based on these data, treatment optimisation with PI pretreated children should be considered for the benefit of" "" "unborn" "" "aggenetics." ""
After oral administration, the average duration (tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of amprenavir is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.
508% increased, by 30% for CMAx, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).
The administration of amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).
Therefore, the minimum concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by the intake of food, although the simultaneous food intake impacted the extent and rate of resorption.
The apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to a large distribution volume and an unimpeded penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.
This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, with the amount of unbound amprenavir which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.
While absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of the free active component fluctuates during the dosing interval, depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration in the Steady State across the range of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.
Therefore, drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 and present a substrate of CYP3A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time as Avalase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).
The gift of Agenerative capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to similar daily amprenavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.
Amprenavir is from the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; hence, Avalase solution and Agenerative capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram basis.
The renal clearance of ritonavir is also negligible, so the effect of a kidney function disorder should be limited to the elimination of amprenavir and ritonavir.
These treatment schemes lead to amprenavir plasma levels comparable to those observed in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg amprenavir twice daily with no simultaneous administration of ritonavir.
In long-term studies on carcinogenicity with amprenavir on mice and rats, the male animals used benign hepatocellular adenomas at dosages representing the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8-fold (rat) exposure to humans, after twice daily doses of 1200 mg amprenavir.
The underlying mechanism for the development of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been clarified and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.
However, there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the current exposure data to humans, both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application.
In a standard battery of In-vivo- and in-vitro genotoxicity tests, which included bacterial reverse mutations tests (Ames test), mouse lymphom test, microkernel test on rats and chromosomal aberrations in human peripheral lymphocytes, amprenavir was neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.
This liver toxicity can be monitored and detected in clinical daily life by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.
Until now, no significant liver toxicity was observed in clinical trials, neither during the administration of appremics nor after the end of the treatment.
Toxicity studies on juveniles treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with amprenavir.
In systemic plasma exposure, which was significantly lower (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than expected exposure to therapeutic doses in humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus ongation and minor skeletal changes were observed, indicating delayed development.
24 If Avalase capsules are used without the intensifying addition of ritonavir (booster), higher doses of Avalase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.
The recommended dose for Avalase capsules is 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).
The simultaneous use should be done with caution in patients with weak or slight liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunctions it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).
26 For some drugs that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under the supervision of the International Regised Ratio), methods for determining the drug concentration are available.
If a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).
An increased risk of lippodystrophy was associated with individual factors, such as higher age, and drug addictive factors, such as prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.
It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of amprenavir, which can lead to virological failure and resistance development.
508% increased, for CMAx, by contrast, reduced by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).
The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma, which were achieved in the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg ritonavir.
Dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, a close monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and safety of this combination is not known.
Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure to both protease inhibitors would decrease.
Caution is advised if these drugs are used together; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring is to be carried out, since precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir on Delavirine is difficult.
If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin along with Avalase, a reduction in the dose of rifabutin will be recommended to at least half the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available for this.
Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, anisoldipine and verapamil can be increased by amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these drugs.
In a clinical study in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels rose by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).
With the simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Avalase, increased control of INR (International Regised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).
The simultaneous administration of ortho-novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg of ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg of Norethindron) led to a 22% decrease in AUC and cmin of amprenavir.
During pregnancy, this medicine may only be applied after careful balancing of the possible benefits to the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.
A reproduction study of pregnant rats, given by the loss in the uterus to the end of the breastfeeding time of amprenavir, showed a diminished increase in body weight during lactation.

In case of overdose, the patient may be exposed to signs of intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary, necessary supportive measures can be initiated.
The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro vs HIV-1 IIIB was studied in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.
The 50% Hemp Concentration (IC50) of amprenavir is in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM with acutely infected cells and is 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).
Conversely, amprenavir maintains its activity against some other protease inhibitors-resistant isolates; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.
Based on these data, treatment optimisation with PI pretreated children should be considered for the benefit of "unborn" aggenetics.

The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than from amprenavir as capsule; hence, Avalase capsules and solution for gaining on a milligram per milligram basis are not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).
Patients should, once they are able to swallow the capsules, stop taking the solution to intake (see Section 4.4).
The recommended dose for Ageneric solution is 17 mg (1.1 ml) amprenavir / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2800 mg amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).
Additionally, since no dose recommendation can be given for simultaneous use of Ageneric solution for intake and low-dose knight avir, this combination can be avoided in these groups of patients.
Although a dose adaptation for amprenavir is not considered necessary, an application of Ageneric solution for intake in patients with kidney failure is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).
Due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high glycol content, Avalase is a solution for entering small children and children under 4 years, in pregnant women, in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and contraindicated in patients with kidney failure.
Concurrent administration may lead to a competitive inhibition of drug metabolism and may cause serious and / or life-threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders (z).
The patients should be pointed out that apgeneric or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.
The current antiretroviral therapy, including the treatment with aspirin, does not prevent the risk of 47 a transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.

The application frequency and the duration of the treatment with Aldara depend on the disease to be treated: • In case of small basal cell carcinomas, the cream is to be applied five times a week for six weeks. • In case of small basal cell carcinomas, it is available three times a week during one or two four-week treatment cycles.
The cream can be applied thinly to the affected areas of the skin before bedtime, so that it will remain on the skin for a long time (about eight hours) before being washed off.
In all studies Aldara was compared with a placebo (same cream, but without the active ingredient). • Aldara was tested in four main studies of 923 patients with warts in the genital area for 16 weeks each.
The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated warts. • Aldara was also studied in 724 patients with small basal cell carcinomas in two trials, in which patients were treated for six weeks and Aldara or placebo were either daily or five times a week.
The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tumor after 12 weeks. • Aldara was also tested in two studies of a total of 505 patients with actinic keratosis.
• In all studies Aldara was more effective than the placebo. • In the treatment of warts in the genital area, the total treatment rate in all four main studies was 15% to 52% in the patients treated with aldara. • The results of the two studies on basal cell carcinomas showed a complete recovery rate of 66% to 80% in the patients treated with Aldara in comparison to 0% to 3% in the placebo group.

It should take place in these patients between the benefits of a treatment with imiquimod and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or graft-versus-host reaction.
In other studies where no daily authygiene was performed, two cases of severe phimosis and one case were observed with circumcision leading to circumcision.
In an application of imiquimod cream in higher than the recommended doses, there is an increased risk of severe local skin irritation (see Section 4.2.) In rare cases, severe local skin irritation were observed, which required treatment and / or have led to temporary physical impairment.
In cases where such reactions occurred at the outlet of the urethra, some women had difficulties with urination, which necessitated an emergency catheterisation and treatment of the affected area.
For the application of imiquimod cream immediately following treatment with other cutaneous medications used for treatment of external genital warts in the genital and perianalgesia, no clinical experience has been reported so far.
Limited data suggest a higher rate of susceptibility reductions in HIV-positive patients, but imiquimod cream has shown a lower efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the elimination of tilt warts.
The treatment of basal cell carcinoma with imiquimod within 1 cm around the eyelids, the nose, the lips or the hairline was not studied.
Local skin reactions are frequent but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or the reactions form after completion of the treatment with imiquimod cream.
If it is necessary because of the patient's discomfort or due to the severity of the local skin reactions, a treatment break can be made of several days.
The clinical outcome of the therapy may be assessed after the recovery of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment.
Since there are currently no data on long-term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment, other suitable forms of therapy should be considered with super-artificial basal cell carcinomas.
There are no clinical experience in patients with recurrent and previously treated BCCs, therefore the use of previously untreated tumors is not recommended.
Data from an open clinical trial suggest that large tumours (> 7.25 cm2) reduce the likelihood of response to imiquimod therapy.
Imiquimod was not examined for the treatment of actinic keratoses on eyelids, inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lips.
There are only very limited data on the use of imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratoses in anatomical positions outside the face and scalp.
The available data on the actinic keratosis on the underarms and hands does not support the effectiveness in this application, therefore such application is not recommended.
Local skin reactions occur frequently, but these reactions usually take off in the course of therapy or go back after the therapy with imiquimod cream.
If the local skin reactions cause severe discomfort to the patient or are very strong, the treatment may be exposed for a few days.
From the data of an open clinical study, patients with more than 8 acne lesions showed a lower complete cure rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.
Due to the immunostimulatory properties, imiquimod cream should be applied with care in patients who receive an immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).
Animal studies show no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or post-natal development (see 5.3).
Although no quantifiable serum levels (> 5ng / ml) were obtained, neither after a one-time nor after repeated topical application, no recommendation can be given to the application during the lactation period.
The most commonly reported and probably or possibly associated with the application of imiquimod cream related side effects in studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the field of treatment of cowards (33.7% of patients treated with imiquimod).
The most commonly reported and probably or possibly related side effects associated with the Imiquimod cream application include complaints at the site with an incidence of 28.1%.
The basalioma patients treated by 185 with imiquimod cream from a placebo-controlled clinical trial of phase III reported side-effects listed below.
The most common adverse event, probably or possibly with the application of the imiquimod cream related adverse effect, were in these studies a reaction at the place of application (22% of patients treated with imiquimod).
The adverse events indicated by 252 in placebo-controlled clinical trials of phase III with imiquimodine-cream patients with actinic keratosis are listed below.
The evaluation of clinical signs indicated according to the study plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials with Imiquimod cream, it is common to local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excreation / skewing / scraping (23%) and edema (14%) (see Section 4.4).
The evaluation of clinical signs indicated according to the study plan shows that in these studies, with Imiquimod cream, it was very common in these studies with severe erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%), and to severe deformation and crushing (19%).
In clinical trials investigating the use of imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratosis, alopecia was determined with an incidence of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.
The accidental oral reception of 200 mg ismiquimod, which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.
The clinically serious side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of > 200 mg, consisted of hypotonia which normalized after oral or intravenous fluids.
In a pharmacokinetic examination, systemic concentrations of alpha interferons and other cytokines were found following the topical application of imiquimodine.
In 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the cowards in an imiquimod treatment is significantly superior over 16 weeks of placebo treatment.
In 60% of all patients treated with Imiquimod, patients treated the patients completely; this was the case with 20% of the patients treated with placebo (95% CI):
A complete healing could be achieved in 23% of 157 patients treated with imiquimod, compared to 5% of 161 patients treated with placebo (95% CI):
The efficacy of Imiquimod over 5 times a week over 6 weeks was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.
The target tumours were histologically confirmed primary, super-artificial basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.
The data presented from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years showed that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all patients treated were clinically cured and this remained for 48 months.
Imiquimod's efficacy in one or two weeks of treatment in one or two weeks of treatment, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free time period, was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.
Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non hyperkeratotic, non hypertrophic acne lesions within a coherent 25 cm2 treatment area on the unhairy scalp or face.
The one-year data from two combined monitoring studies show a recurrent rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical radiation after one or two treatment periods.
The approved indications external genital warts, actinic keratosis and super-cell carcinoma typically do not occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.
Aldara Cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials involving children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimmod n = 576, Placebo n = 313).
The efficacy of imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the doses studied there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks).
Minimal systemic absorption of the 5% imiquimod cream through the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed in the three times weekly application during 16 weeks.
The highest concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were observed between 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bags), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).
The calculated half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-life after the subcutaneous application in an earlier study; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin.
The data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of imiquimod was low after topical application on MC-ill skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with actinic keratosis or super-artificial basal cell carcinoma.
In a four-month study on dermal toxicity in rats doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study conducted for the dermal application for four months revealed no similar effects.
A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice with mal administration of three days a week did not induce tumors at the point of use.
The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since imiquimod has only a small, systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagen, a risk is considered to be very low because of the systemic exposure.
Tumors appeared in the group of mice treated with the active-free cream, earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.
It may harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you. − When any of the listed adverse events affect you significantly or you notice any side effects not indicated in this use information, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.
● Feigwarts (Condylomata acuminata), which have formed on the skin in the area of genitalia (sexual organs) and anus (anus)? surface basal cell carcinoma This is a frequently encountered, slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spreading to other parts of the body.
If it remains untreated, it can lead to clarifications, especially in the face - therefore an early detection and treatment is important.
Actinic keratoses are rough areas of the skin that occur in people who were exposed to sunlight during their previous life.
Aldara should only be used for flat actinic keratitis in the face and on the scalp in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Aldara is the most appropriate treatment for you.
Aldara cream supports your body's own immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body combat the superficial basal cell carcinoma, the actinic keratosis or the virus responsible for infection with infection.
O If you have used Aldara cream or other similar preparations earlier, please inform your doctor about this before you have problems with your immune system. o Use Aldara cream until the area to be treated is cured after a previous drug or surgical treatment.
Don't use more cream when your doctor has prescribed you. o Wash the treated spot after applying Aldara cream not with a dressing or bandage. o If reactions occur on the treated spot, which cause you severe inconvenience, wash the cream with a mild soap and water.
Once the reactions are cloned, you can continue the treatment. you will inform your doctor if they do not have a normal blood image.
If this daily cleansing is not carried out under the foreskin, swelling, thinning of the skin or difficulties when tracing the foreskin can be expected.
Do not apply Aldara cream in the urethra (urethra), in the vagina (vagina), the cervix (cervix) or within the anus (anus).
Taking other medicines should have serious problems with your immune system, you should use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle.
If you have intercourse with genital warts in the genital area, the treatment with Aldara cream after sexual intercourse (not earlier) is to be performed.
Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use other medicines or have recently applied, even if they are not prescription drugs.
Do not breastfeed your baby during treatment with Aldara Cream, as it is not known whether Imiquimodine passes into breast milk.
The frequency and duration of treatment are different at tilt, basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis (see specific instructions for each application).
Apply a thin layer of Aldara cream to the clean, dry skin with the warts and rub the cream on the skin carefully until the cream is fully absorbed.
Men with cowards under the foreskin must pull the foreskin back every day and wash the skin area underneath (see section 2 "What do you need to consider before using Aldara Cream?").
Please talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have the impression that the effect of Aldara is too strong or too weak.
6 weeks each week a sufficient amount of Aldara cream can be applied to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area.
Very common side effects (expected in more than 1 out of 10 patients) Frequent side effects (in less than 1 out of 100 patients) Grade-related side effects (in less than 1 of 1,000 patients to be expected) Very rare side effects (in less than 1 of 10,000 patients to be expected)
Inform your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you do not feel comfortable while using Aldara Cream.
If your skin responds too strongly to the treatment with Aldara cream, you should not use the cream further, wash the affected area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmacist.
A reduced number of blood cells can make you more susceptible to infections; it can cause you to get a blue spot faster or cause dizziness.
Inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed adverse events affect you significantly or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information.
In addition, you may feel itching (32% of patients), burning (26% of patients) or pain in the areas you have applied Aldara cream (8% of patients).
Usually these are lighter skin reactions, which end in about 2 weeks after settling the treatment.
Occasionally some patients notice changes in the application location (wound secretion, inflammation, swelling, shame, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and fatigue.
Occasionally, some patients suffer from changes in the application location (bleeding, inflammation, wound secretion, ulceration, feel or discomfort), inflammation of the nasal mucosa, clogged nose, flu, acute keratosis, redness, facial swelling, ulcers, aching limbs, fever, weakness or chills.
Aldurazyme is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves).
This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not degraded and therefore accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.
The following non-neurological symptoms of the MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints that complicate movements, decreased lung capacity, heart and eye diseases.
The treatment with Aldurazyme should be supervised by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.
The administration of Aldurazyme should be administered in a hospital or clinic with revitalizing devices, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction.

The study was primarily examined for the safety of the drug, but its effectiveness was also measured (by reducing its impact on reducing GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).
In children under the age of five, Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.
The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over 5 years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat, fever, and reactions to the infusion station.
Very frequent side effects in patients under the age of five are elevated blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measure of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.
Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be severely oversensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).
The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will examine all new information that may be disclosed each year and, where necessary, update the summary.
The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients who receive aldurazyms in terms of reactions to infusion and development of antibodies.
In June 2003, the European Commission granted the company Genzyme Europe B.V. a permit for the transport of Aldurazyme across the European Union.
Laronidase is a recombinant form of the human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced by recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).
Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).
The treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.
The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can, if the patient tolerates this, will be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes.
The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyms in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.
The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyms in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.
Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see Section 4.8).
For this reason, especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of aldurazyms should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which recovery facilities for emergency medical emergencies are immediately available.
As a result of the clinical phase 3 study, almost all patients with IgG-antibodies against laronidase usually form within 3 months from the start of treatment.
Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using aldurazyms (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).
Since there is little experience in the resumption of treatment after a longer break, due to the theoretically increased risk of a hypersensitivity reaction after an interruption of the treatment, caution must be done carefully.
Treat 60 minutes prior to the onset of infusion with medications (antihistamines and / or antipyretics) in order to minimize the potential incidence of infusion-related reactions.
In the event of mild or moderate infusion-related reactions, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or a reduction of the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate at which the reaction occurred.
In case of a single severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are dropped, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.
The infusion can be resumed with a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate at which the reaction occurred.
3 are (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) and a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate at which the previous response occurred.
Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with Chloroquin or Procain because there is a potential risk of interference with the intracellular absorption of laronidase.
Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy that include embryonic / fetal development, birth and post-natal development (see section 5.3).
Since there is no data on newborns exposed to laronidase over breast milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed during treatment with Aldurazyms.
Adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as infusion-related responses, observed in 53% of patients in the phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients enrolled in the study with participants less than 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).
Adverse drug reactions related to aldurazyms observed during the phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years are reported in the following table: very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to < 1 / 10).
In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre-history, severe reactions followed, including bronchospasm, respiratory failure and visual edema (see Section 4.4).
Children undesirable drug interactions associated with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged 5 years, with mainly severe expiration and treatment duration up to 12 months, are listed in the table.
100 E / kg IV once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg IV once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg IV every 2 weeks.
Most patients had a seroconversion within 3 months after the onset of the treatment, with a severe follow-up in patients aged under 5 years (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older).
Until the end of the phase 3 study (or up to early excretion from the study) no investigational antibodies (RIP) assay were detected in 13 / 45 patients, including 3 patients with whom it had never been released.
Patients with low-low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the GAG level in urine, whereas in patients with high antibody titers a variable reduction of GAG in urine was determined.
Four patients (three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic Laronidase activity in vitro, which did not affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in urine.
The presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions, even if adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.
The rationale for the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrats and the prevention of further accumulation is sufficient recovery of enzymatic activity.
After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely about mango-6 phosphate receptors.
The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.
Although patients were recruited for the study that showed the entire spectrum of disease, the majority of patients were of the middle phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.
Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.
The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk test.
All patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg aldurazyms each week for another 3.5 years (182 weeks).
After 26 weeks of therapy, the patients treated with Aldurazyme showed improvement in lung function and ability to perform in the following table.
The open extension study showed improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as follows from the following table.
The decrease in the expected percentage FEV is clinically significant over this period and the absolute lung volume increases further proportionally to the body size of growing children.
Of 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly prior treatment 22 (85%) reached normal liver size until the end of the study.
Within the first four weeks a clear decrease of the GAG-Mirror was found in the urine (µg / mg of creatinine), which remained constant until the end of the study.
In terms of the heterogenous manifestation of the disease between the patients, which was taken into account by using a combined repository, the clinically significant change across five levels of efficacy was generally observed in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening in 9 patients (20%).
A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme was examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years (16 patients with severe expiration form and 4 with the mean follow-up form).
In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased Gag- Mirrors in Harn in the last 26 weeks.
In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and weight gain (n = 3) were determined by the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with severe expiration (< 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed normal mental development speed, whereas in older patients with severe expiration only limited or no progress in cognitive development was observed.
In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazyme dosing regimens were performed on the GAG-Spiegel in the urine, the liver capacity and the 6-minute hearing test.
100 E / kg IV once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg IV once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg IV every 2 weeks.
The dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a justifiable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent.
The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated.
The pharmacokinetic profile in patients aged under 5 was similar to those affected by older and less severely affected patients.
Based on conventional research on safety harmacology, toxicity in a unique gift, toxicity in repeated application and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot be identified by any particular danger to humans.
Since no tolerability studies have been carried out, this drug may not be mixed with other drugs, except those listed below 6. 6.
If the ready-to-use preparation is not used immediately, it should not be stored for more than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8º C if the dilution was controlled under controlled and validated aseptic conditions.
5 ml concentrate for the production of a solution in a carrying bottle (type I-glass) with stoppers (silicon-chlorinated rubber) and sealing (aluminium) with tear cap (polypropylene).

Within the given time, the owner of the marketing authorization has completed the following study programme, whose results provide the basis for the annual assessment report on the benefit-risk ratio.
This register will provide long-term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with Aldurazyme, as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment.
In patients suffering from MPS I there is an enzyme called α -L-Iduronidase which breaks down certain substances in the body (glycosaminoglycans), either in small amounts or this enzyme is missing completely.
If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to one of the constituents of Aldurazyme or if you have an allergic reaction to laronidase.
An infusion-related reaction is any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see section 4 "What side effects are possible").
If you use aldurazyms with other medicines, please inform your doctor if you are taking pharmaceuticals that contain chloroquin or procain because there is a potential risk of a diminished effect of Aldurazyme.
Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken, including non-prescription pharmaceuticals.
Instructions for handling - thinning and application The concentrate for the production of an infusion solution must be diluted before application and is intended for intravenous application (see information for physicians or medical staff).
The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can, if the patient tolerates this, will gradually increase to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes.
In some patients with severe MPS-I--related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre-history, however, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, breathing pattern and facial oils.
Very common (occurrence of more than 1 out of 10 patients): • headache • nausea • abdominal pain • Joint disorders, joint pain, back pain, pain in arms and legs • Reduced • fever • increased pulse • Hypertension • less oxygen in the blood • Reaction at the infusion station
The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information available every year, and if necessary, the package insert will be updated.
If the ready-to-use preparation is not used immediately, it should not be stored for more than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8º C if the dilution was controlled under controlled and validated aseptic conditions.
Preparation of the Aldurazyme infusion (using aseptic technique) • Depending on the weight of the individual patient, determine the number of leakage bottles to be diluted.
Alimta is used together with Cisplatin (another medicine against cancer) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy (cancer for cancer) and "maligne" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body) and is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body).
Alimta is used in patients who have not previously been treated in combination with Cisplatin and in patients who have previously received chemotherapy as a single treatment.
To reduce side effects, patients should take corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.
"" "when Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, a" "" "anti-emetic" "" "(medicine against vomiting) and liquids (to prevent a lack of fluids) should be given before or after the administration of cisplatin." ""
In patients whose blood image changes or where certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be delayed, discontinued or the dose is reduced.
The active form of Pemetremixed slows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents cells from dividing.
The transformation of Pemetremixed into its active form is more readily available in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells.
In a main study, Alimta was examined for the treatment of malignant pleuramesothelioma in 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease.
In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study involving 571 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease, previously treated with chemotherapy, were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another medicine against cancer).
In addition, Alimta was compared to gemcitabine (another anti-cancer medicine), both in combination with cisplatin in a study involving 1,725 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.
Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin survived an average of 12.1 months compared to 9.3 months with Cisplatin alone.
In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months in docetaxel.
In both studies, however, patients in which the cancer did not attack the cell epithelial cells in the administration of Alimata showed longer survival times than with the comparative medicine.
In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. a permit for the transport of Alimta across the European Union.
Each carrying bottle must be dissolved with a 0.9 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), which results in a resolution of 25 mg / ml.
The corresponding volume of the necessary doses is taken from the flow bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see section 6.6).
ALIMTA is shown in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small bronchial carcinoma except for the majority of plateepithelial histology (see Section 5.1).
ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of second-line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non-small bronchial carcinoma, except in the case of vast plateepithelial histology (see Section 5.1).
The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface area (KOF) is administered intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.
The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as infusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.
In patients with non-small bronchial cancer following previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.
To reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid will be given the day before and on the day of the Pemetremixed administration and the day after treatment.
During the seven days before the first dose of Pemetrexed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last pemetrexed- dose.
Patients also have to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week before the first mixed dose and after each third treatment cycle.
In patients receiving Pemetremixed, a complete blood flow should be created before each application, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and a platelet count.
Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine-transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.
A dose check must take place at the beginning of a new treatment cycle taking into account the Nadirs of the blood sample or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the preceding therapeutic cycles.
After recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.
These criteria reflect the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degrees 2 bleeding.
Should patients not develop non-haematological toxicity ≥ Grade 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient has the value before treatment
The treatment with ALIMTA must be aborted if a hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity level 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose reductines or, on the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.
Clinical trials showed no evidence that in patients aged 65 years old or over 65 years of age, there is an increased risk of side effects.
ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 because of insufficient data on harmlessness and efficacy.
In clinical trials, no dose modifications were necessary in patients with a creatinine Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, which go beyond the dose modifications recommended for all patients.
The data situation in patients with a Kreatinin Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was insufficient, so the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).
However, patients with a liver function restriction of > the 1.5-fold upper bilirubin limit and / or transaminase values of > the 3,0-fold of the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) or > 5.0-fold of the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) were not studied specifically in the studies.
Patients must be followed with immunosuppression and Pemetremixed must not be administered to patients before their absolute number of neutrophilately has again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombocyte number has again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.
Dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute number of neutrophilas, thrombocyte numbers and maximum non-hematological toxicity observed in previous cycles (see section 4.2).
A lower toxicity and a reduction in degrees of 3 / 4 hematological and non-matological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was observed when pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 occurred.
Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetremixed must be instructed to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophylactic measures to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see Section 4.2).
Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid simultaneous seizure of nonsteroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsalicylic acid (> 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with mixed drugs (see section 4.5).
All patients, for which a therapy with pemetremixed is provided, must avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-life for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with mixed fixed mixed (see section 4.5).
Many patients with whom these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing hypertension, or diabetes.
Therefore, in patients with clinically significant accumulation of fluids in the transcellular space, a drainage of the effusion before the pemetremixed treatment should be considered.
5 primary cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were reported in clinical trials involving pemetrexed occasionally when this drug was usually given in combination with another cytotoxic substance.
For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated live vaccine (except yellow fever, this vaccine is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).
Since the possibility of irreversible foaming of the reproductive capacity is due to pemetremixed, men should be advised prior to the treatment-tin to obtain advice regarding the sperm conservation.
In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of nonsteroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs, such as Ibuprofen > 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid can result in reduced mixed elimination with the consequence of increased occurrence of side effects.
It is therefore advisable to apply high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid in high doses in patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).
Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid can be avoided in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with pemetremixed (see Section 4.4).
Since no data is available with regard to the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application with pemetremixed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with pemetre- xed.
The great intra-individual variability of coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Regised Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.
There are no data for the use of pemetremixed in pregnant women, but as with ande- and antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy.
Mixed seeds may not be applied during pregnancy except if necessary and after careful balancing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see Section 4.4).
Since the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity is due to pemetremixed, men should be advised prior to the start of treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of the sperm.
It is not known whether pemetremixed is transferred into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breastfed baby cannot be ruled out.
The following table shows the severity and severity of adverse effects reported in > 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and the randomized Cisplatin and Pemetremixed, as well as 163 patients with mesothelioma who were randomized to receive Cisplatin as monotherapy.
Frequent (≥ 1 / 10 and < 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000 and < 1 / 1000), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000 and < 1 / 1000), very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 and < 1 / 1000), very rare (< 1 / 10,000) and not known (based on the available data from spontaneous reports).

Clinically relevant CTC toxicity reported at < 1% (occasionally) of patients receiving a randomised pemetrexed, included supraventricular arrhythmias.
The clinically relevant laboratory toxicity level 3 and 4 was similar to the three individual Pemetremixed-monotherapiestudies (n = 164) of phase 2, except for neutropenia (12.8% compared with 5.3%) and an increase in alanine-transaminase (15.2% compared to 1.9%).
These differences are likely to lead to differences in the patient population as the Pha- se 2 studies included both chemonaive and clearly pre-treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metastases and / or abnormal starting values of liver function tests.
The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse events related to study medication; they were reported in > 5% of 839 patients with NSCLC, who were randomised to receive Cisplatin and Pemetremixed and received 830 patients with NSCLC, which randomized Cisplatin and gemcitabine.

Clinically relevant toxicity reported at < 1% (occasionally) of patients who received ran- domed Cisplatin and Pemetremixed, included:
Serious cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, including myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, cerebrovascular accidents and transitory ischemic attacks were occasionally reported in clinical trials involving mixed drugs administered by another cytotoxic agent.
Clinical trials occasionally reported cases of coli- tis (including intestinal and rectal bleeding, sometimes fatal, intestinal perforation, intestinal necrosis and typhonic).
Clinical trials occasionally reported cases of sometimes fatal interstitial pneumonitis with respiratory failure in patients with mixed treatment.
Reported cases of acute kidney failure in mixed monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy drugs (see Section 4.4).
Cases of radiation pneumonitis were reported in patients who were beamed before, during or after their pemetremixed therapy (see Section 4.4).
ALIMTA (Pemetremixed) is an antineoplastic antifolate which performs its effect by interrupting important folate-dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.
In vitro studies show that pemetrexed works as an antifolate with multiple attacks by blocking the thyme dylate synthase (DHFR) and glycinamidribonucleotidfor- myltransferase (GARFT), which are folate-dependent key enzymes in the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purinnucleotides.
EMPHACIS, a multicenter, randomised, single-blind phase 3 study by ALIMTA plus Cisplatin against cisplatin in chemonaiven patients with malignant pleuramesothelioma demonstrated that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had a clinically significant advantage of a median 2.8-month extended survival compared to those patients who were only handled by cisplatin.
The primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the investigational medicine in the treatment arm (randomised and treated).
A statistically significant improvement of clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnea) in connection with malignant pleuramesothelioma was shown in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm (212 patients) compared to the allottomettin-arm (218 patients).
The differences between the two arms were improved by improving lung function parameters in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm and worsening lung function over time in the control arm.
A multicenter, randomised, open Phase III study with ALIMTA versus docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after prior chemotherapy demonstrated median survival of 8.3 months with patients treated with ALIMTA (intent to treat population n = 283) and patients treated with docetaxel (ITT n = 288).
An analysis of the influence of histology on overall survival was determined in favor of ALIMTA in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non-disklepithelial histological type (n = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.61-1.00, p = 0.047), adjusted HR = 1,56; 95% CI = 1,08-2.26, p = 0.018).
Limited data from a separately randomised controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data (survival and progression-free survival) for pemetremixed between patients with (n = 41) and without (n = 540) pretreatment are similar to docetaxel.
The efficacy analyses of the PQ population are consistent with the analysis of the ITT population and support the non-inferiority of the ALIMTA Cisplatin combination opposite the gemcitabine Cisplatin combination.
Mean PFS was 4.8 months for the combination ALIMTA Cisplatin versus 5.1 months for the combination of gemcitabine Cisplatin (HR = 1.04; 95% CI = 0.94 - 1.15), the overall response rate was 28.2% (95% CI = 25.0 - 31.4) for the combination of gemcitabine Cisplatin.
The analysis of the influence of NSCLC's histology on survival showed clinically relevant differences in the histology, see table below.
CI = Confidence interval; ITT = intent-to-treat; N = size of the total population a statistically significant for non-inferiority, with a total confidence interval for HR (= Hazard ratio) significantly below the non-standard limit of 1,17645 (p < 0.001).
Patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin required fewer transfusions (16.4% versus 28.9%, p < 0.001), erythrocyte fusions (16.1% versus 27.3%, p < 0.001) and thrombocytic conversions (1.8% versus 4.5%, p = 0.002).
In addition, the patients required sel- tener the gift of erythropoetin / darbopoetin (10.4% versus 18.1%, p < 0.001), G-CSF / GM-CSF (3,1% versus 6.1%, p = 0.004), and iron compounds (4.3% versus 7.1%, p = 0.021).
In 426 cancer patients with different solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 838 mg / m ² in infusion zones over a period of 10 minutes, the pharmacokinetic properties of pemetrexed as a monotherapeutical were examined in doses ranging from 0.2 to 838 mg / m ² in infusion zones over a period of 10 minutes.
Pemetremixed is mainly excreted in the urine and 70% to 90% of the administered dose will be found in the urine within 24 hours after the application.
Pemetremixed has a total value of 91.8 ml / min and the half-life in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance 90 ml / min).
In a study with Beagle-dogs who had received intravenous bolus injections for 9 months, sticky changes were observed (degene- ration / necrosis of the seminifous epithelial tissue).

ALIMTA is used in patients who have received no prior chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of malignant pleural pleuramesothelioma (malignant type of rib) in combination with Cisplatin, another drug for the treatment of cancer.
If you have kidney problems or earlier, please discuss this with your doctor or hospital pharmacy, as you may not be allowed to receive ALIMTA.
Blood tests will be carried out before any infusion; it checks whether your kidney and liver function is sufficient and whether you have enough blood cells to obtain ALIMTA to 49.
Your doctor may change the dose or interrupt treatment if it requires your general condition and if your blood levels are too low.
If you also get cisplatin, your doctor will ensure that your body contains sufficient water and you will receive the necessary medicines to prevent vomiting before and after the cisplatin administration.
If there is a fluid accumulation around the lungs, your doctor may decide to remove this liquid before you receive ALIMTA.
If you would like to become a child during the treatment or in the first 6 months after the treatment, please talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
Please tell your doctor if you are taking medicines against pain or inflammation (swelling) such as those called "nonsteroidal antiphlogistika" (NSAIDs), including medicines which are not subject to prescription (such as ibuprofen).
Depending on the planned infusion of your ALIMTA infusion and / or the extent of your kidney function, your doctor will tell you which other medicines you can take, and when.
Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription drug.
A hospital pharmacy, nursing staff or doctor will mix ALIMTA powder with sterile 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) before it is applied to you.
Your doctor will prescribe cortisone tablets (according to 4 mg dexametha son twice daily), which you must take on the day before, during and day after the application of ALIMTA.
Your doctor will prescribe folic acid (a vitamin) for intake or multivitamins which contain folic acid (350 to 1000 micrograms), which you have to take once a day while using ALIMTA.
In the week before the application of ALIMTA and approximately every 9 weeks (corresponding to 3 cycles of treatment with ALIMTA) you will also receive an injection of Vi- tamin B12 (1000 micrograms).

It is applied to overweight adults with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low-calorie, low-fat diet.
Patients who take Alli and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmacist.
If these enzymes are inhibited, they can not break down some of the fats in the diet, causing about a quarter of fats that are added to the diet undigested in the intestines.
In a third study Alli compared 391 overweight patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 compared to placebo.
In both studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who received Alli 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after one year, compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo.
In the study with Alli in patients with BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, no significant weight loss could be observed for patients.
The most common side effects of Alli (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are oily spots on after, flate (winch) with studiness, stuhldiness, oily / oily chair, outlet oily secretion (Fäzes), flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.
It may not be applied to patients who are treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.
It may not be applied in patients suffering from a long-term malabsorption syndrome (where insufficient nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract) or cholestasis (liver disease), and pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers.
In July 2007, the European Commission granted the Company Glaxo Group Limited a permit for placing orlistat GSK across the European Union.
Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (Body-Mass-Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypokalisches, low-fat diet.
Alli may not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety.
Since orlistat is only minimally resorbed, no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for elderly and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.
• hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin (see Section 4.6) • Cutting time (see Section 4.6) • Constent treatment with Warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Sections 4.5 and 4.8)
The likelihood of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) may increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich meal or a low-fat diet.
As weight reduction in diabetes may be associated with improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy with alli because the dose of antidiabetic medication should be adjusted if necessary.
Patients taking alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage needs to be adjusted.
It is recommended to take additional fluctuating measures in order to prevent possible failure of oral contraception in the event of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).
Both in a study on interactions of drugs and in several cases with simultaneous application of orlistat and Ciclosporin, a reduction of Ciclosporin plasma levels was observed.
In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-Values (internationally controlled ratio, INR) could be influenced (see Section 4.8).
In most patients treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, the concentration of vitamins A, D, E and K and beta carotene in the normal range remained normal.
However, patients should be advised to take a supplement of multivitamin before bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamin intake (see Section 4.4).
After the application of a disposable dose Amiodarone was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time, a slight decrease in the Amiodarone plasma concentration.
Animal experiments showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or post-natal development (see section 5.3).
The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are related to the pharmacological effect of the drug, as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented.
Gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.
The frequencies are defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 100, < 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, < 1 / 1000), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000, < 1 / 1000), and very rarely (< 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).
The incidence of adverse events detected after the market launch of orlistat is not known, as these events have been reported voluntarily by a population of a certain size.
† It is plausible that the treatment with alli can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.
Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and overweight subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings.
In the majority of cases reported after the market launch, either side effects or similar adverse events were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.
Based on investigations on humans and animals, a rapid regression of any systemic effects that can be attributed to the noninhibiting properties of orlistat can be assumed.
The therapeutic effect sets in the lumens of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonding to the active Serin-rest of the gastric and pankreatic lipies.
From clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day, blocked the absorption of approximately 25% of the food fat.
Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypokalisches, low-fat diet.
The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to baseline (at the time of randomisation), was assessed as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of studies (Table 1) and as part of those study participants who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).
Although weight loss was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.
The average change in the Gesamtcholesterin with orlistat was 60 mg -2.4% (baseline 5.20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (baseline 5.26 mmol / l).
The average change in LDL cholesterol with orlistat was 60 mg -3.5% (baseline 3.30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (baseline 3.41 mmol / l).
At the waist circumference, the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (initial value 103.5 cm).
Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (< 5 ng / ml).
7 In general, non-metabolized orlistat in plasma could only be sporadically and in extremely low concentrations (< 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of cumulation.
In a study involving obese patients who administered the minimal systemic-resorbed dose, two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed lactonring) and M3 (M1 after splitting the N-Formyl-Leucine group), could be identified, representing approximately 42% of the total plasma concentration.
Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated dose, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot be identified as a hazard to humans.

Alli is used for weight reduction and is used for overweight adults aged 18 and older using a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 28 or above. alli should be used in conjunction with a low-fat and low-calorie diet.
The BMI helps you determine whether you have a normal weight in relation to your height or overweight.
Even if these diseases do not cause you to feel uncomfortable, you should nevertheless ask your doctor for a check up.
For each 2 kg bodyweight you lose in a diet, you can lose an additional kilogram with the help of alli.
Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it, even if they are not prescription drugs.
Ciclosporin is used after organ transplants, in severe rheumatoid arthritis and certain serious skin diseases.
Oral contraception contraceptives and alli • The effect of oral antibiotics to prevent pregnancy (pill) may be weakened or removed if you have strong diarrhoea (diarrhea).
Before taking alli to your doctor or pharmacist, please contact your doctor or pharmacist if you: • Take Amiodarone for the treatment of heart rhythm disorders.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you take alli and if you take medicines for high blood pressure, as you may need to adjust the dosage. if you take medicine against too high cholesterol levels, as you may need to adjust the dosage.
For more information on the blue pages, see Section 6 for further helpful information on how to set your calorie-targets and fetal boundaries.
If you omit a meal or if a meal contains no fat, do not take a capsule. alli can only work if the food contains fat.
If you take the capsule in connection with a meal containing too much fat you risk food-related escort phenomena (see section 4).
To get used to the new eating habits, start before the first capsules intake with a calorie and fat-reduced diet.
Food diaries are effective as you can understand at any time what you eat, how much you eat and it will likely be easier to change your eating habits.
In order to achieve your target weight, you should set two daily goals in advance: one for the calories and one for fat.
• Try low fat to reduce the likelihood of diet-related concomitant phenomena (see section 4). • Try to move more before starting taking the capsules.
Remember to ask your doctor in advance if you are not used to physical activity. • Stay during intake and even after the intake of alli physically active.
• alli must not be taken longer than 6 months. • If after twelve weeks of application of alli no reduction of your weight can be determined, please ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice.
In certain circumstances, you have to stop taking alli. • In case of successful weight loss, it is not about changing the diet for a short time and returning to the old habits.
• If less than one hour has passed since the last meal, take the capsule after. • If more than one hour has passed since the last meal, do not take any capsule.
Flatulence with and without oily exit, sudden or increased bowel movement and soft chair) can be attributed to the mode of action (see section 1).
Severe allergic reactions • Serious allergic reactions can be seen in the following changes: severe shortness of breath, sweating, rashes, itching, swelling of the face, palpitations, cardiovascular collapse.
29 Very frequent side effects These can occur in more than 1 out of 10 people who are taking alli. • Bapulence (Flatulence) with and without edema • Plötzlich Stuhldiness • asy or oily chair • Soft Chair inform your doctor or pharmacist if one of these side effects is amplified or you significantly affected.
Frequent side effects These can occur in 1 out of 10 people who are taking alli. • gastric (abdominal) pain, • Incontinence (Chair) • aqueous / liquid stool • Infections inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of these side effects amplify or significantly affect you.
It is not known how often these effects occur. • Increasing specific liver enzyme levels • Effects on blood clotting in patients who take warfarin or other blood-thinning (anticoagulating) drugs.
Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed adverse events affect you significantly or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information.
The most common side effects are associated with the mode of action of the capsules and result in increased fat excreted from the body.
These side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment, since at this time you might not have consistently reduced fat in your diet.
With the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the diet-related side effects: start already a few days, or better a week before the first intake of the capsules with a fat-reduced diet. • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions you normally take.
If you know exactly how much you eat, the likelihood of losing your fat limit decreases. • Divide your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals.
Save the amount of calories and fat you may consume each meal, not to take them in the form of a fat-rich main dish or a substantial dessert, as you might have done in other programs for weight loss.
• Keep out of the reach of children. • Do not store alli after the expiry date indicated on the carton. • Keep tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture. • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with silica gel, which serve to keep the capsules dry.
Do not swallow it. • You can carry your daily dose of alli in the blue transport box (shuttle) which is included in this package.

Being overweight has an impact on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as: • High blood pressure • Diabetes, Cardiovascular disease • Osteoarthritis talk to your doctor about your risk for these diseases.
A permanent weight loss, for example by improving nutrition and more exercise, can prevent the onset of serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health.
Choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to eat healthily.
Energy is also measured in kilojoules, which you can also find as an indication of the food packaging.
Note the tables below. • The recommended intake of fats in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should consume with each meal.
Which amount is suitable for you, refer to the information below, which indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you. • Due to the capsule's mode of action, adherence to the recommended intake of fats is crucial.
If you take the same amount of fat as before, this can mean that your body cannot handle this amount of fat.
By adhering to the recommended intake of fats, you can maximize weight loss while at the same time reduce the likelihood of diet-related accompanying symptoms.
34 These reduced calorie intake should allow you to lose weight incrementally and continuously about 0.5 kg per week without developing frustrations and disappointments.
The more active you are, the higher your recommended calorie intake. • "Low physical activity" means that you daily work little or no stairs, work stairs, work in the garden or perform other physical activities. • "Medium Physical Activity" means you exercise 150 kcal daily, i.e. 3 km walk, 30 to 45 minutes gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes.
• For permanent weight loss, it is necessary to set up realistic calorie and fat goals and adhere to them. • meaningful is a nutrition journal containing information on calorie and fat content of your meals.
The alli program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutrition plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed calory and fat ducks and give guidelines to become more physically active.
In conjunction with a program tailored to your type of weight loss, this information can help you develop healthier lifestyle and achieve your goal weight.
Aloxi is used in chemotherapies that are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as Cisplatin), as well as for chemotherapies which are moderate vomiting for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).
The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as an antiemetic).
The use in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended, as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group.
This means that the active substance inhibits the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to receptors in the intestines.
Aloxi was examined in three main studies of 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy, which are strong or moderate vomiting for nausea and vomiting.
In chemotherapies, which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).
In chemotherapies, which are moderate nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).
In a comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).
In March 2005, the European Commission granted regulatory approval to the company Helsinn Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd.
Almaxi is indicated: to prevent acute nausea and vomiting with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy due to a cancer illness and to prevent nausea and vomiting with moderate emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.
The efficacy of Aloxi in preventing nausea and vomiting that is induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy may be amplified by adding a corticosteroids given before chemotherapy.
Since Palonosetron can extend the colon massage, patients with anamnestically obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus should be closely monitored after injection.
However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advised with simultaneous administration of palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients where the Qt interval is extended or which tend to such an extension.
In addition to chemotherapy, Aloxi is not to be used for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.
In preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not inhibit the activity of the five studied chemotherapy drugs (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabin, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).
A clinical study showed no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a steady-state- concentration oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.
In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population based pharmacokinetic analysis, CYP2D6 inhibitors (dexamodarone, celecoxib, chlorpromazin, cimetidine, doxorubicin, fluoxetine, ranitidine, ritonavir, sertraline and terbinafin) had no significant effect on the Palonosetron Clearance.
Experience on the use of palonosetron in human pregnancies is not present, therefore Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician.
In clinical trials, the most common adverse events were observed at a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which at least were related to Aloxi, headache (9%) and obstipation (5%).
Very rare cases (< 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the delivery site (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing reports.
In the group with the highest dosage similar frequencies appeared of adverse events as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-effect relationships observed.
No dialysis studies were carried out, but because of the large distribution volume, dialysis is probably not an effective treatment with an aloxi- overdose.
In two randomised double-blind studies, 1,132 patients receiving a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of doxorubicin and 250 mg. of Dolasetron (half-life of 7.3 hours) were given that were given intravenously on Day 1 without dexamethasone.
In a randomised double-blind study, 667 patients who received a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2cisplatin, > 1,500 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin and 250 or 750 mcg. of Palonosetron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg Ondansetron which were given intravenously on day 1.
Results of the study with commonly used chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are combined in the following tables.
In clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and dolasetron were comparable.
According to clinical studies, Palonosetron possesses the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and extend the duration of the stockholders potential.
The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was the evaluation of the ECG effects of intravenous palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.
Resorption After IV administration follows an initial decrease of plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average half-life of approximately 40 hours.
The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the surface area under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally measured in the entire dose range of 0,3,90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients dosisproportionately.
After intravenous administration of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase in the plasma concentration of 11 testicular cancer patients was 42 ± 34%.
Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that the total composition (AUC0- ∞) reached at once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg of Palonosetron was comparable with the following one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg. however, the CMAx was higher after one-time intake of 0.75 mg.
About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites compared to Palonosetron over less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.
In-vitro studies on metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, in a lesser extent, are involved in the isoenzyme CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 on the metabolism of palonosetron.
Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as unaltered drug made about 40% of the given dose.
After a one-time intravenous bolus injection in healthy patients the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.
In patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminal exclusion period and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron increased, however, a reduction in the dose is not justified.
In preclinical studies, effects were observed only after exposures, which are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.
10 Out of preclinical studies there are indications that Palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and extend the duration of action.
High doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded to approximately 30 times the therapeutic exposure in humans) that were given daily over two years led to increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal glands) and skin tumors in rats but not in mice.
The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and since Aloxi is determined by humans for unique use, the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans.

In June 2006, the Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a negative report, in which the approval of the marketing of the drug prescribed for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.
This means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicinal product called Roferon-A with the same medicinally effective ingredient that is already approved in the EU.
Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver illness caused by viral infection).
A microscopic examination shows the liver tissue damage, and the values of the liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are elevated in the blood abnormal.
It is produced by a yeast, into which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which stimulates the formation of the active substance.
The manufacturer of Alpheon showed data that show the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).
In the study on patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of alpheon was compared to 455 patients with the efficacy of the reference medical device.
The study measured how many patients responded to the medicine after 12 of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after treatment (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).
(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int
Furthermore, concerns have been voiced that data on the stability of the active substance and the drug to be marketed is not sufficient.
The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical study.
Following the treatment with Alpheon, the disease worsened again in more patients than with the reference drug. Alpheon also had more side effects.
In addition to this, the test used in the study investigates the question of how far the medicine has an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), is not sufficiently validated.
It can be used for the treatment of impetigo (a skin infection associated with crusts) and small infected lathe (crack or cut-off), abrasions and sewn wounds.
Altargo should not be used to treat infections that were provable or probably caused by methicillintough Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not work against this kind of infection.
Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18 the area to be treated must not be more than 2% of the body surface.
If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.
It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced) and thereby inhibit the growth of the bacteria.
The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was detectable at the end of the treatment.
119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients under placebo discussed the treatment.
In the treatment of infected skin findings, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together with skin-dogs, approximately 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment.
In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (filled cavities in the body tissue) or infections that were provable or probably caused by MRSA.
The most frequent side effect associated with altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the order.
The Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Altargo over short-term treatment outweigh the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small infirings, abrasions or sewn wounds.
In May 2007, the European Commission granted the Company Glaxo Group Ltd a licence for the placing of altargo across the European Union.
Patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).
In the event of a sensitization or serious local irritation through the use of Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment is interrupted, the ointment is carefully wiped off and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection is started.
Reapamulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as the pathogen or is suspected (see Section 5.1).
The efficacy of reapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.
Alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs after a 2 to 3 day treatment.
The effect of simultaneous use of reapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.
A clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see Section 5.2) due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical application on the scented skin or infected surface wounds.
3 After the simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg. of ketoconazole, the mean reapamulin EC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe increased by 81% on the skin of healthy adult men.
Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosisadaptations are not considered necessary if topical reapamulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.
Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).
Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of reapamulin is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotic.
In deciding if breastfeeding continues / ends or the therapy should be continued with Altargo, between the benefit of breastfeeding for the baby and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for woman should be weighed.
In clinical trials involving 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that have applied altargo, the most common reported side effect was irritation at the date of delivery involving approximately 1% of the patients.
Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of leuromutilin, a substance produced by fermentation from clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).
The mode of action of retapamulin is based on selective blocking of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the second sub-unit of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.
Data suggest that the binding site of ribosomal protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P binding site and the peptidyltransferase center.
Binding to this binding site inhibits peptidyltransmission, block partial P-binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.
If due to the local prevalence of resistance the application of retapamulin appears to be questionable in at least some infection forms, consultation by experts should be sought.
There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of retinapamulin over S.aureus, irrespective of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.
In case of non-response to the treatment at S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.
Resorption In a healthy adult study, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was performed daily with occlusion on intact and rested skin for up to 7 days.
Of 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.
The sampling procedure took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.
However, the maximum individual systemic shot on humans after topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) was 660 times lower than the reapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.
Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microsoms was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).
In studies on the oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.
In-vitro-examination on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test respectively in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in the rat-microkernel test for in-vivo investigation of chromosomal effects.
There was neither male nor female rats showing reduced fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, thus reaching an exposure of up to 5 times higher than the highest estimated human exposure (topical application to 200 cm2):
In an embryotoxicity study of rats, at orally dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (corresponding to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure (see above), development toxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed Ottoman) and maternal toxicity were detected.

The owner of the marketing authorization will undertake to carry out the detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities outlined in the pharmacovigilance plan and additional pharmacovigilance activities, as described in version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP), as well as all additional updates of the RMP which are agreed with CHMP.
As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal use," the updated RMP should be submitted simultaneously with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.
Irritation or other signs and symptoms at the treated area show you should quit the application of altargo and talk to your doctor.
Do not use any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with altargo if you have not expressly been prescribed by your doctor.
It must not be used in the eyes, on the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.
If the ointment is made out of sight on one of these surfaces, wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if complaints arise.
After applying the ointment, you can cover the affected area with a sterile association or a Gazette, unless your doctor has advised you to not cover the area.
It is offered in an aluminium tube with a plastic closure that contains 5, 10 or 15 grams of ointment, or in an aluminium pouch containing 0.5 g ointment.
Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between one and fifteen years who are not immune to these two diseases.
"" "" "" "Ambirix is used as part of one of two doses of existing vaccination plans, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered." ""
For this reason, Ambirix should only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunisation and it is ensured that the existing vaccination plan can be completed from two doses.
If a refresher dose for hepatitis A or B is desirable, Ambirix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given.
"" "vaccines act by" "" "teach" "" "the immune system (the natural defense of the body) as it can fight against a disease." ""
After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens as "alien" and produces antibodies against it.
Ambirix contains the same ingredients as the vaccine approved since 1996, and the vaccine approved since 1997 Twinrix children.
The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix are given children within the framework of a vaccination programme consisting of three doses.
Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults were also used as evidence of the use of Ambirix.
The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed protective antibody concentrations a month after the last injection.
In an additional study involving 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to six months and a 12 month gap between the two injections.
In between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children, Ambirix led a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations in hepatitis A and B.
The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar to six and a 12-month gap between the injections.
The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in over 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, loss of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, fatigue and irritability.
Ambirix may not be used in patients who may possibly be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other constituents or neomycin (an antibiotic).
In August 2002, the European Commission granted the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals. a permit for the placing of Ambirix in the whole
The standardisation plan for priming with Ambirix is made up of two vaccines, the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.
If a booster for hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B is desired, vaccines can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovalent vaccines or with a combination vaccine.
The anti-Hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) antibody values are in the same magnitude as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.
It is not yet fully ensured if immunocompetent persons, who have responded to a hepatitis C vaccine, need a booster formation as protection, since they may also be protected by immunological memory even in non-detectable antibodies.
3 As with all injection vaccines, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the application of the vaccine.
If a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardisation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended, containing 360 ELISA units of formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.
In hemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, under certain circumstances, there is no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBs-antibody value, so that additional doses of vaccines may be required in these cases.
Since intraocular injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal vaccination rate in the buttocks, these injections should be avoided.
However, in cases of thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disturbances, however, Ambirix may be injected subcutaneously, as it can result in bleeding in these cases after intramuscular administration.
When Ambirix was given in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, acellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB), the immune response was sufficient to all antigens (see Section 5.1).
In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it is necessary to assume that no sufficient immune response is achieved.
In a clinical study carried out with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, maturation, gastroenteritis, headache, and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in previous Thiomerically and preservative-based vaccine Formulation.
In clinical trials, 2029 doses of Ambirix were given to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to and including 15 years.
In a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15, Ambirix's tolerance was compared to that of the 3-dose combination vaccine.
Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and consistency on a calculation basis per capita of Ambirix, but not based on a calculation basis per person.
Pain was observed after the injection of Ambirix at 50.7% of the subjects, compared with 39.1% in the subjects according to the dose of the 3-dose combination vaccine.
After the complete inoculation cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who had given Ambirix had pain, compared 63.8% for the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.
However, the frequency of maturity was comparable to proband (i.e. throughout the entire vaccine cycle at 39.6% of the subjects who received Ambirix compared with 36.2% of the subjects receiving the 3-doses combination vaccine).
The frequency of severe pain and maturality was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccine protocol.
In a comparative study of 1- to 11-year-old vaccines, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambient Group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.
In the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a more frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not pro-band, was reported.
The proportion of vaccine that reported severe side effects during the 2-doses vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-doses vaccine with the combined vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalinactivated hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.
In clinical trials conducted at ages 1 to and including 15 years, seroconversions for anti-HAV 99.1% were one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose, for month 6 month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).
Serum-conversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose, for month 6 month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).
7 In a comparative study carried out in 12- to and including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 received the standard combinant vaccine with three doses.
In the 289 persons whose immunogenicity was outstanding, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the injection of the 3-dose vaccination than with Ambirix.
The immune responses reported in a clinical comparative study of 1-11-year-olds one month after completion of the full inoculation series (i.e. in month 7) are listed in the following table.
Both studies received either a 2-dose vaccine with Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units of formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.
For persons who were aged between 12 and 15 years of age, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6 month vaccination scheme.
The immune response observed in this study was comparable to those found in 3 doses with a combined vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalinactivated Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.
In a clinical study at 12- to including 15-year-olds, it could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs-antibodies is comparable 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 month vaccination scheme is comparable to that in the 0-12 month vaccination scheme.
When the first dose of Ambirix in the second year was given at the same time with the booster of a combined phtheri-, tetanus, acellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens.
A clinical study carried out with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults showed similar seroprotective and seroconversions as for the previous formulation.
The vaccine is examined both before and after resuspening on any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes.
In accordance with Article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC, the state charge release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized for this purpose.

The hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral foods and beverages, but can also be transmitted by other means, such as bathing in waters contaminated by effluents.
You may feel very tired, have a dark urine, pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary.
As with all vaccines, Ambirix can not fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete inoculation series has been completed with 2 doses.
If you / your child are already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus before administering both vaccine doses (though you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of the vaccine), a vaccine may not prevent a disease.
Protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those after hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any part of this vaccine including Neomycin (an antibiotic).
An allergic reaction can be expressed by itching skin rashes, breathing difficulties or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B, if you / your child has a severe infection with fever / has.
• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the usually scheduled dose of the second vaccination dose).
At a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and the second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from vaccination with Ambirix.
Instead, he / her child will recommend three injections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccine (360 ELISA units of a formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen).
The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vaccination protection before ending the vaccine series.
Sometimes, Ambirix will be injected into the skin and not injected into the muscle in persons suffering from severe blood clots. if you / your child is weakened due to a disease or a treatment in your body's own defence / is or if you / your child undergo a hemodialysis.
Ambirix may be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the response to vaccination is.
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take additional medicine / take (including those that you can get without prescription) or if you / your child have been vaccinated recently / have received or have been planned in the near future.
However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.
If another vaccine must be given simultaneously with Ambirix should be vaccinated at separate places and as many different limbs as possible.
If Ambirix should be given at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient.
Usually, Ambirix will not be given pregnant or breastfeeding women unless it is urgent that they are vaccinated against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B.
Important information about certain other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Neomycin (antibiotic).
If you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible.
♦ very often (more than 1 case per 10 diluted doses): • pain or discomfort on the set or redness • Matiness • irritability • headache • lack of appetite
♦ often (up to 1 case per 10 diluted doses): • swelling at the injection point • fever (above 38 ° C) • Headed • gastro-intestinal discomfort
Other side effects that were rarely reported for days or weeks after vaccination with comparable combination or single vaccines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (less than 1 case per 10,000 untreated doses) are:
These include localized or extended attacks which can be itching or inflated, swelling of the eye area and face, difficult breathing or swallowing, sudden loss of blood pressure and loss of consciousness.
Flu-like symptoms, including chills, muscle and joint pain, seizures, dizziness, grievances such as tingling and "ant run," multiple sclerosis, diseases of the optic nerve, loss of sensation or movement ability of some parts, severe headaches and stiffness of the neck, interruption of normal brain functions

Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.
On the basis of the data, which have been known since the first approval of the placing on the market, the CHMP believes that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix will remain positive.
However, since Ambirix was placed in traffic only in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine are limited due to the low patient exposure.
Ammonia may also be used in prehistory in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzymatic defect or with hyperammonian encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations).
Ammonia is administered - split by several single doses at meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or administered via a gastrostomy hose (through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading tube) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach leading tube).
This was not a comparative study because ammonia could not be compared with a different treatment or placebo (a placebo medicine, i.e. without an active ingredient).
Ammonia may also lead to loss of appetite, abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disorders, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.
The Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that ammonia in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevented high ammonia values.
"" "ammonia was" "" "allowed" "" "under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information about this drug." ""
The use is indicated in all patients, where a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).
In patients with a late-manifest form (incomplete enzymatic defect that manifests after the first month of life) there is an indication of the use when a hyperammonia encephalopathy is present in the anamnesis.
For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.
The daily dose is calculated individually, taking into account the protein intolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient.
According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults.
The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early manifest deficiency of Carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithinskabel bamylase.
Patients with argininosuccinate synthetase deficiency must receive arginine at a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.
AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with difficulty swallowing since there is a risk for the development of oesophagus ulcera if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.
Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, respectively 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.
AMMONAPS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure and with sodium retention and edema.
Because metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat are carried through the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be applied with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure.
The importance of these results with regard to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).
Subcutaneous injection of phenylacetate to young rats at high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg) resulted in a slowdown of neuronal proliferation and increased loss of neurons.
There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a decreased number of dysfunctional nerve endings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.
It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted into breast milk in humans, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the lactation period (see 4.3).
In clinical trials with AMMONAPS at least one undesirable event (AE) occurred in 56% of patients and 78% of these unwanted events were assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.
The frequency is defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, < 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, < 1 / 100).
A likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactate, severe hypokalemia, curb topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.
A case of overdose occurred in a 5 month-old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).
These symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity in intravenous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.
Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound that conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted by the kidneys.
Interferometrically, phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore an alternative agent for excretion of excess nitrogen.
5 patients with disturbances of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram, sodium phenylbutyl rate can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen.
It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately to improve survival chances and clinical outcome.
The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infectious, and the disease itself led to death even in the treatment of peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues within the first year of life.
By hemodialysis, the use of alternative routes of nitrogenous excretion (sodium phenylbutyrat, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and eventually substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn babies at post partum (but within the first life month) to 80%.
Patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and who were already treated before the first appearance of a hyperammonia encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients, there was time with many intellectual disabilities or other neurological deficits.
In patients with a late manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of the Ornithininscarcanylase deficiency), which recovered from hyperammonia encephalopathy and subsequently treated with sodium phenylbutyrat and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.
Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients another worsening of the neurological condition can occur.
It is known that phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidney by glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.
The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined after injection of a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, haemoglobin metabolism and with liver cirrhosis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled trials).
The behavior of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients following intravenous injection of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.
After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in tablet form, concentrations of phenylbutyrat measured 15 minutes after ingestion were detected.
In the majority of patients with urine leakage or haemoglobinopathies, phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) was detectable in plasma after nocturnal fast after nocturnal fasting.
Three out of six patients with cirrhosis of liver cirrhosis treated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day oral in three single doses) were five times higher in plasma concentration on the third day than after the first gifts.
Excretion The drug is excreted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product Phenylacetylglutamine by the kidneys.
After the results of Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyrat had no carcinogenic effects in rats treated with toxic and non-toxic dosages (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).
AMMONAPS granules are either taken orally (babies and children who cannot swallow tablets, or patients with dysphagia) or through a gastrostomy or nasal probe.
According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults.
The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.
The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early manifest deficiency of Carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithinskabel bamylase.
AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrat, respectively 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.
When rat oil was exposed before the birth of phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrat), lesions were found in the pyramids of the brain cortex.
A likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactate, severe hypokalemia, curb topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.
Interferometrically, phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess
On the basis of investigations on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disturbances of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram, sodium phenylbutyl rate can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen.
Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients another worsening of the neurological condition can occur.
After an oral one-dose dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in granular form, concentrations of phenylbutyrat measured 15 minutes after ingestion were detected.
During durability, the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature not above 25 ° C.
In this procedure the small measuring scoop contains 0.95 g, the mean measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.
If a patient has to receive the medication via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate amounts to 5 grams in 10 ml of water).
In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins.
If you are carrying out laboratory tests, you must tell the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, because sodium phenylbutyrat can influence the results of certain laboratory studies.
If you are taking AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it, even if they are not prescription drugs.
During the breastfeeding period, you may not take AMMONAPS, as the medicine may pass into the mother's milk and harm your baby.
In rare cases confusion, headache, taste disturbances, obstruction of hearing, disorientation, memory problems and worsening of existing neurological conditions were observed.
If you notice any of these symptoms, immediately contact your doctor or the emergency department of your hospital for the purpose of initiating appropriate treatment.
If you forgot to take AMMONAPS, take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal.
Changes in the blood image (red blood cells, white blood cells, thrombocytes), decreased appetite, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, unpleasant skin smell, rash, kidney function, weight gain and abnormal laboratory values.

If you are taking AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it, even if they are not prescription drugs.
You should take AMMONAPS distributed evenly on the same single doses or via a gastric (tube, which runs directly into the stomach through the abdominal wall) or a nasal probe (tube caused by the nose to the stomach).
• Take from the container a heaped measuring scoop of granulate. • Stretch a straight edge, e.g. a knife-back over the upper edge of the knife to remove excess granulate. • The amount remaining in the measuring spoon corresponds to a measuring spoon.
Angiox is used for the treatment of adult patients with "acute coronary syndrome" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in case of unstable angina (a form of pain in the chest with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "uplift" (an anomalous measured value for electrocardiogram or ECG).
If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing a PCI, a higher dose is administered and infusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure.
This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.
Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox in allure or in combination with glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug to prevent blood clots) was compared with conventional combination treatment with heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.
During the PCI, patients were often stent (a short tube remaining in the artery to prevent closure), and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as rituximab and aspirin.
In the treatment of ACS, angiox - with or without the administration of GPI - was as effective in preventing new events (death cases, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or a year as much as conventional treatment.
In patients undergoing a PCI, angiox was as effective as Heparin in relation to all indicators, except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than Heparin.
Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to Bivalirudin, other Hirudine or any of the other components.
It may not be applied to patients who had a bleeding recently, and people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart attack.
The Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is an acceptable substitute for Heparin.
In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd a licence for the transfer of angiox across the European Union.
For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST-uplift infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency intervention or early intervention.
The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous dose of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.
If a PCI is performed in a further sequence, an additional pin of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.
According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours.
Immediately before the procedure a rejection of 0,5 mg / kg should be administered followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.
The recommended dose of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous return of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a immediately subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.
The safety and efficacy of a single bolus gift of angiox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned.
If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight should take place.
In order to reduce the incidence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed before use and the bolt dose is administered intravenously.
As soon as the ACT value amounts to more than 225 seconds, further surveillance is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.
In patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min) which are subjected to a PCI (whether treated with Bivalirudin vs. ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.
If the ACT-value lies under 225 seconds, a second dose dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose to check again.
In patients with moderate kidney damage, included in phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which resulted in approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after application of the Bivalirudin-Bolus without dosage adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.
3 For patients with severe kidney damage (GFR < 30 ml / min) and also with dialysis patients angiox is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).
Treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intravenous administration of unquestionable heparin or 8 hours after completion of the subcutaneous administration of low molecular heparin.
• More well-known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any other component or against hiudine • active bleeding or an increased risk of bleeding due to a disturbance of the hemostasis system and / or irreversibly bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR < 30 ml / min) and with dialysis patients
Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially if Bivalirudin is given in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).
Even though PCI patients perform most of the haemorrhage of arterial punctures under Bivalirudin, patients with a percutaneous corona intervention (PCI) may undergo bleeding during the treatment.
In patients who are taking Warfarin and being treated with Bivalirudin, monitoring of the INR value (International Regised Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after setting the treatment with Bivalirudin again reaches the level before treatment.
Based on the knowledge of the mode of action of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytic or Thrombocyte aggregationshemmer), it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding.
In the combination of Bivalirudin with thrombocyte units or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological haemostasis parameters are regularly monitored.
Animal experimental studies are inadequate with regard to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or post-natal development (see under section 5.3).
4612 were randomized to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unfractionated heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.
Both in the bivalent group as well as in the comparable groups treated with Heparin, women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients.
Severe bleeding was defined according to ACUITY and Timi standards for severe bleeding, as in the footnotes of table 2.
Both mild and severe bleeding performed significantly less frequently under Bivalirudin than in the groups with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and Biocheminidine plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see table 2).
An ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intraarterial, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the point area, which required radiological or surgical intervention, reduction of haemoglobin cone of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products to transfusion.
Other, less frequently observed bleeding localisations, which occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" puncturing points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or neck.
The following information on side effects is based on the data of a clinical trial with Bivalirudin in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.
Both in the Bivalence group as well as in the comparable groups treated with Heparin, women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients.
Both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently under Bivalirudin than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.
The following side effects not listed above have been reported in practice after extensive application and are grouped according to system organgrades in Table 6.
In case of overdosing, the treatment with a bivalirudin is to be stopped immediately and the patient closely monitor with regard to signs of bleeding.
Angiox contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific thrombininhibitor, which binds to the catalytic centre as well as on the anionic nerve tissue region of Thrombin, irrespective of whether thrombine is bound in the liquid phase or in clots.
The binding of Bivalirudin to Thrombin, and therefore its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin on its part restores the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, thereby regenerating the function of the active centre of Thrombin.
In addition, it was possible to induce thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS) in the past.
In healthy subjects and in patients, Bivalirudin shows a dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect which is occupied by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.
If a PCI has been performed in the patients, an additional bolt of 0,5mg / kg Bivalirudin should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery will be increased to 1,75mg / kg / h.
In arm A of the ACUITY study, unquestionable Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST-uplift infarction (IA / NSTEMI).
Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor before the onset of angiography (at the time of randomization) or on the PCI.
In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high risk patients required by angiography within 72 hours were spread evenly across the 3 treatment arms.
Approximately 77% of patients had a recurring ischemia, 70% had dynamic EKG changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of all patients underwent angiography in 72 hours.
The primary analysis and results from the ACUITY study for the 30-day and 1-year endpoint for the overall population (ITT) and for patients receiving aspirin and Clopidogrel according to protocol (before angiography or before the PCI) are shown in tables 7 and 8.

* Clopidogrel before angiography or before PCI 1 A ACUITY serious bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intraarterial, retroperito neal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the point area, reduction of hemoglobin cone of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products to transfusion.
The 30-day results, based on quadruple and triple endpoints of a randomised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI (REPLACE-2), are shown in table 10.
Clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.
The pharmacokinetic properties of Bivalirudin were evaluated in patients undergoing a percutaneous corona intervention (PCI) and in patients with ACS.
It is expected that Bivalirudin is going through a catabolism in its amino acid components with subsequent revaluation of the amino acids in the body pool.
The primary metabolism resulting from the splitting of the ARG3-Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence through Thrombin is not effective because of the loss of its affinity to the catalytic centre of Thrombin.
The elimination takes place in patients with normal kidney function after a first order process with a terminal half-life of 25 ± 12 minutes.
Based on conventional research on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated application, genotoxicity or reproduction toxicity, preclinical data cannot be identified by any particular danger to humans.
Toxicity in animals with repeated or continuous exposure (1 day to 4 weeks with exposure to 10-fold of the clinical Steady-state plasma concentration) restricted nasal pharmacological effects.
Adverse events as a result of a longer-term physiological strain as a reaction to non-homeostatic coagulation were not observed after short exposure to those in clinical application, even at a much higher dosage.
If the manufacturing of ready-to-use solution 17 is not controlled under controlled and validated aseptic conditions, it is no longer to be stored for 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C.
Angiox is a freeze-dried powder in single dose containers of type 1 glass to 10 ml that are sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and sealed with pressed aluminium cap.
5 ml sterile water for injection purposes are given into a flow bottle Angiox and slightly waved until everything has completely dissolved and the solution is clear.
5 ml are taken from the carrying bottle and diluted with 5% glucose solution for injection or with 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride solution for injection in a total volume of 50 ml to obtain a final concentration of 5mg / ml Bivalirudin.

Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children aged six years with diabetes who need treatment with insulin.
Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.
Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin for regulating the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or unable to process insulin.
Insulin luglisin differs very slightly from the human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter active duration than a short-acting human insulin.
Apidra was studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.
In type 2 diabetes, in which the body cannot work effectively, Apidra was examined in a study of 878 adults.
The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.
In the first study involving type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was determined after six months compared to a reduction of 0.14% for insulin.
In adults with type 2 diabetes the lowering of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% with human normal insulin.
Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to insulin lucsin or any of the other components, or in patients suffering from hypoglycemia.
The doses of Apidra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that can affect blood glucose levels.
In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a licence for the placing of Apidra in the entire European Union.
Apidra is used as a subcutaneous injection either in the abdominal area, thigh or deltoid muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the abdominal area.
Due to reduced glucose-ogenesis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin demand in patients with reduced liver function can be reduced.
Any change of the active force, the brand (Her- adjuvant), the type of insulin (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of production, can change the insulin demand.
3 inadequate dosing or abortion of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening.
Switching a patient to another type of insulin or insulin from another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage.
The time when hypoglycemia occurs depends on the effectiveness of the insulin used and can therefore change when the treatment plan is changed.
Among the substances that increase blood sugar dropping and increase the tendency towards hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, monoamine oxidase, propoxyphene, salizylate and sulfonamide antibiotics.
In addition, the effect of stenolytics such as beta blockers, clonidin, guanethiamin and reserpine can be alleviated or missing the symptoms of adrenaline expression regulation.
Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between Insu- lingfulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth, or post-natal development (see section 5.3).
It is not known whether insulin delivery occurs in human breast milk, but in general insulin does not occur in breast milk nor is it resorbed to oral use.
The following are listed in clinical trials, grouped according to system organgrades and ordered according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 1000, < 1 / 1000; rarely: ≥ 1 / 10,000, < 1 / 1000; very rare: < 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).
Cold sweat, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, dizziness, excessive dog, changes in vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.
Lipodystrophy If neglected to continuously change the injection area within the injection area, a lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site.
Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), given by an appropriately trained person, or by intravenous injections of glucose by a doctor.
After a glucoon injection, the patient should be supervised in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes.
Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption (especially due to skeletal muscle and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.
Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous GA- be of insulin-lucsin the effect occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with cou- mant normal insulin.
In a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes melli- tus, insulin delivery in therapeutically relevant metering range of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a dose of proportional glucosity, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in glucose-causing effect, just like human insulin.
Insulin luglisin has twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the full glucose-giving effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.
The data showed that a similar post-denounced glycaemic control was achieved in an application of insulin lucsin 2 minutes before the meal, like with a human body insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.
Insulin lucsin was tanned 2 minutes before the meal, a better postoperative control was achieved than with the human body insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.
When the insulin lucsin is turned 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control is achieved, such as the human body insulin, which is given 2 Mi- nuds prior to the meal (see Figure 1).
Insulin delivery in doses 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the beginning of the meal compared to the human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1A) and compared to the human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) prior to a meal (Figure 1B).
Insulin delivery in 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the beginning of the meal compared to the human Nor- malodine, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).
