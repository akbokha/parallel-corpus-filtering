this document is a summary of the European Public assessment report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the trials conducted to make recommendations on the use of the medicine .
if you need further information about your disease or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. verteb@@ rate thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ Dis@@ order , a mental disorder in which the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal elation ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood .
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and for the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have referred to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al problems if the oral consumption of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution for intake or melting tablets can be applied to patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who are taking other drugs at the same time as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose should be adjusted by A@@ bili@@ fy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mit@@ ters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells to one another . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably acts primarily as a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mitter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole acts like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent than the neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mit@@ ters to activate recept@@ ors .
as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing their occurrence .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent the recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that suffered from increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours with placebo .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared over 12 weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence in 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ sed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from increased un@@ rest , compared to a period of two hours by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo .
in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients was examined using a standard dial for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melt tablets and the solution to intake ( absor@@ bs ) .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients receiving A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , significantly increased the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness than the patients receiving a placebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy reduced in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo .
for up to 74 weeks , A@@ bili@@ fy prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses were also more effective than placebo for the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy for intake ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disturbances ( un@@ controlled ) , tre@@ mor ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , vomiting , nausea , ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , drow@@ sin@@ ess , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes , and in which the man@@ ic episodes were based on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in addition , the Committee concluded that the benefits of injection solution in quick control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al problems in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if oral therapy is not appropriate , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd a licence for the placing of A@@ bili@@ fy in the European Union .
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and whose man@@ ic episodes were based on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , once a day regardless of meals .
an increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 m@@ g. has not been proven , even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , irrespective of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
in consideration of the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicide in patients with bi@@ polar disorder compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disturbances ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vig@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ cel@@ eri@@ ated and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy treat signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , it should be considered to reduce the dose or to break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a M@@ NS , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be removed .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and addressing for un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no accurate risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ ps , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes Mel@@ lit@@ us should be regularly monitored with respect to worsen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle , and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advised if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally active drugs with over@@ bearing side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ ine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects , which is why similar doses should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metaboli@@ zers , the common application with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole can result in extensive metaboli@@ sation compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
considering the common gift of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects , and similar doses should be made .
after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose height prior to the start of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be used together with A@@ bili@@ fy .
in clinical trials doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ morph@@ an / 3 @-@ Metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ met@@ or@@ phi@@ c ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
this drug may not be used during pregnancy because of insufficient data for the safety of humans and due to the concerns arising in animal studies in animal studies , unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against operating dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following adverse events occurred more often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks , patients receiving Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole decreased overall less incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Parkinson &apos;s , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to those treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with an arith@@ me@@ tic treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ distur@@ b@@ ance - in a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ op@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
there was no medi@@ cally significant difference between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects associated with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy and their occurrence in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include malign@@ ant neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intended or inten@@ tional over@@ dos@@ ages were observed with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death sequence .
there is no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is useful in the treatment of over@@ dosing as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma retention .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- Rec@@ ept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ M recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vitro high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D 2 and D@@ 3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 m@@ g. a day over 2 weeks in healthy subjects , posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and put@@ seeds .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients who were adher@@ ing to the study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives include P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depres@@ sive rates , showed significantly greater improvement than in hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of rel@@ ap@@ se , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % under placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superi@@ ority compared to placebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
in two placebo and active controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a efficacy compared to placebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia in week 12 , such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which were not based on lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy for therapeutic serum levels over 2 weeks , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole resulted in a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ sation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed itself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzyme C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ therapy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ de@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the case of extensive metaboli@@ zers through C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and at nearly 146 hours in &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metaboli@@ zers via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as did a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ related effects .
a complete pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis showed no clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to the eth@@ ni@@ city or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study of subjects with varied liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the detri@@ ment of liver function to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional safety har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and can@@ ogenic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects have only been observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that have significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no meaning for the clinical application .
the effects covered a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the medium Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the medium Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ th of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , concentrations found in the human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found in the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of apes , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro solu@@ bility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 @-@ fold the middle Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical peak dose .

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , once a day regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing A@@ bili@@ fy tablets can alternatively use the melting tablets to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders was reported in some cases after beginning or after changing an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- Rec@@ ept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ M recept@@ ors .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
in a relative bio availability study comparing the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole as a solution for intake of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 In addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ th of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 @-@ fold the middle Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical peak dose .
A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution is used for quick control of agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al problems in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be termin@@ ated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution and started using the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to increase the absorption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by circum@@ fer@@ ing adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) can be administered depending on individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or ac@@ ut therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment is inde@@ xed to Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine on A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy melting tray or A@@ bili@@ fy solution for filing .
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were otherwise caused by schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ins is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed with respect to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure loss ( see section 4.5 ) .
research on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution is not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disturbances ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vig@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ cel@@ eri@@ ated and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and irregular heart@@ beat ) .
poly@@ di@@ ps , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should be regularly monitored with respect to worsen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was greater compared to the single dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study in which healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dosage ) was used intra@@ muscular , and which at the same time received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) intra@@ muscular .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ il@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metaboli@@ zers , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole can result in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &quot; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metaboli@@ zers .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects , and similar doses should be made .
after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose height prior to the start of the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) received intra@@ muscular therapy was greater in the intensity of the Sed@@ ation compared to the single dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the following adverse events occurred more often in clinical trials involving Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following adverse events occurred more often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of more than 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in another study , more than 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ op@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
there was no medi@@ cally significant difference between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred .
increases in the CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects associated with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy and their occurrence in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant major improvements of agi@@ lity / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms of agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the mean improvement of the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end point was 5,@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agi@@ lity , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined on the basis of a reduced number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients who were adher@@ ing to the study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depres@@ sive rates , showed significantly greater improvement than in hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) significantly reduced the rate of rel@@ ap@@ se , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective &apos; weight gain &apos; was , an increase of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which were not based on lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy for therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole resulted in a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ sation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed itself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is 90 % larger during the first 2 hours following intra@@ muscular injection after application of the same dose as tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers the average time was applied to the maximum plasma level of 1 to 3 hours .
the application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were intra@@ muscular in 15@@ - and 5 times over maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity according to IV application did not reveal any safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposition of 30 mg .
based on conventional trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and can@@ ogenic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects have only been observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that have significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; therefore , they have limited or no meaning for the clinical application .
the effects covered a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after doses that led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 @-@ fold of the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical peak dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a main study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , three of whom previously had an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in all@@ some gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medication containing a conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ( given in combination with other medicines for reducing side effects ) .
overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane received treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
if only the patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between drugs and efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival .
in contrast , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
it may not be used in patients who breast@@ feed or have low neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ately in the blood before the treatment begins .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients with the first treatment , more effective than conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and that unlike other pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel drugs , it does not have to be given to other medicines to reduce side effects .
January 2008 , the European Commission issued a permit to Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited to permit the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not indicated ( see also Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ics &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 following series .
in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached to level 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dosage adap@@ tations in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with impaired ren@@ al function have been carried out and there are currently no sufficient data on the recommendation of dose adap@@ tations in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data regarding harm@@ lessness and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel that might have other pharmac@@ ological features than other pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel form@@ ulations ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately stopped and a symptom@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel again .
in patients no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the number of neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ics has increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number is again increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly marked cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been demonstrated in connection with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if there are nausea , vomiting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in the patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating agents .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used for pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age who do not have effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to not produce a child up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised of a sperm con@@ serving prior to the treatment , since the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) that can affect the per@@ dition and ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events that occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , treated in pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most conspic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of the patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at each dose and indication in trials ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate @-@ hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine in the blood , elevated blood sugar , increased phosphor@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :

pain in the chest wall , weakness of mus@@ cul@@ ature , muscular pain , abdominal pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in the skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , flan@@ k pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very frequent :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in @-@ line case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients .
as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual incidence are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established .
pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is an optimi@@ zing mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules that promotes the accumulation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ular indi@@ ces and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their idi@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel by the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ umin@@ receptor and a pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel accumulation in the area of the tumour occurs due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two non @-@ random@@ ized studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised phase III comparative study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion of over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion for 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma .
this multi @-@ centric study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel every 3 weeks either in the form of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication to prevent an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre @-@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for overall response rate and time to progression and progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving First @-@ Line Therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity versus pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy level 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for decay on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of the overall pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the exposure to active ingredients ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml , an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intraven@@ ous injection of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel plasma concentration decreased in multi @-@ phase mode .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or soft tissue adher@@ ence from pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
in a study with patients with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel were compared following an IV 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solution @-@ containing pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane application ( 43 % ) than after a solution @-@ containing pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is primarily metaboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and two smaller metaboli@@ tes ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ure@@ a removal was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metaboli@@ tes 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al Clear@@ ance .
only a few data are available for patients at the age of 75 , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in bright light over 8 hours .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same drug ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicines &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood pressure values , in which complications might occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion , if there is no blood circulation before the intervention and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in treating patients with illnesses for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection may also be carried out by the patient or his car@@ egi@@ ver provided they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always lie in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per deci@@ liter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to be monitored before the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin deficiency , or that the body does not adequately address the body &apos;s own ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a loss of blood .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced into which it enables the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
in an intraven@@ ous injection into a vein , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to a main study of 4@@ 79 patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a vein for at least eight weeks before either stre@@ amed or continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of stre@@ amed stre@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were studied in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained in the same measure as those who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , patients receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure , which can occasionally cause symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ ra@@ ine headaches and confusion .
stre@@ amed must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
stre@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that it does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the European Union regulations , evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that produces Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information packages for the medical staff in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted media approval to the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG for the marketing of Ab@@ se@@ amed across the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion demand in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas , or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
the treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or inadequate , in planned major operative procedures that require large blood volume ( 4 or more units blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
for the reduction of foreign blood Ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery in adults without iron deficiency , where a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ atric patients where the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5,@@ 9 - 6,@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease ; therefore , the doctor is required to assess the individual clinical course and disease condition .
an increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
because of the vari@@ ability between patients , individual ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in one patient or under the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
given this ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is prescribed in the lowest legal dose needed to control an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ a@@ emia .
these clinical findings indicate that patients with an initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
these clinical findings indicate that patients with an initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by intraven@@ ous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ a@@ emia and sequ@@ el@@ ae may vary depending on age , gender and total disease ; therefore , the doctor is required to assess the individual clinical course and disease condition .
given this ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is prescribed in the lowest legal dose required to control an@@ a@@ emia symptoms .
if after 4 weeks of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the verti@@ cu@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the bas@@ eline value , the dose should be 150 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l is increased compared to the bas@@ eline , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ ti@@ cu@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number to ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l should be maintained three times a week .
on the other hand , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reci@@ pro@@ cal cell number increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the bas@@ eline value , a response to epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be abor@@ ted .
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary inser@@ tion of ≥ 4 blood glucose levels is required , should receive se@@ amed in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg of body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery .
iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation programme begins , so that large iron reserves will be available before the start of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each in 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rinse the tube and ensure sufficient injection of the drug into the circulation .
patients who are diagnosed with any ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin at an ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ y ( PR@@ CA ) should not receive a se@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia ) .
heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep vein thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( e.g. ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lis@@ m ) .
the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients who are unable to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or program : severe coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion , vascular disease of car@@ oti@@ des or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accidents ; in patients with a recent heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ cy@@ sti@@ tis ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely was reported on the appearance of an anti@@ body @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of efficacy , defined as a decrease in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the diabe@@ tic value should be determined and the usual causes for non @-@ contact ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium oxide intoxic@@ ation , infections or infections , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the verti@@ cu@@ lo@@ cytes &quot; index &quot; ) , is decreased ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0,5 % ) , the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if no other cause of an active loss is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row for diagnos@@ ing a PR@@ CA .
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for an anti @-@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ a@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 For patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration in Section 4.2 .
in clinical trials , increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thropo@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits that can be attributed to the administration of epo@@ et@@ ins when the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration needed to control an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and to avoid blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evi@@ denti@@ al coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration in Section 4.2 .
according to the current findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of kidney failure .
tumour patients receiving chemotherapy should consider a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa drugs and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin @-@ response ( patients who may need to be trans@@ acted ) for the assessment of the therapy efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
if the increase in h@@ b exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a h@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 , to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see Section 4.2 , treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tion with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thropo@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment with the involvement of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are fores@@ een for a greater electro @-@ orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated appropriately before epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy begins .
patients undergoing larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate thro@@ mbo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , an increased risk of post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events can be ruled out in case of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial repository value of &gt; 13 g / dl .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival or reduce the risk of tumour progression in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ emia .
4 months in people with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , when hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentrations of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were targeted
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine dose should be adjusted to increasing ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F concerning hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
on th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events like m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ cts , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis ) , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pulmon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , an@@ eur@@ y@@ sm , retin@@ alis thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most frequent side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsen@@ ing of an existing hypertension .
increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients with ery@@ thropo@@ ids .
irrespective of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , patients with cardiovascular diseases can come to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications after repeated blood donations .
the genetically @-@ derived epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ lic and is identical to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ em@@ ic patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thropo@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ stom@@ osis ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ omas , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin lymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ o@@ bla@@ sts ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 172 breast carcin@@ omas , 64 gy@@ na@@ ecological tumors , 23 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , and 30 more ) .
1895 patients with solid tumours ( 6@@ 83 breast carcin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 17@@ 4 gy@@ na@@ ecological tumours , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tumors and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ sts .
survival and tumour progression were investigated in five large controlled trials involving a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mortality rate than in controls with an an@@ a@@ emia due to various more frequent malign@@ ancies .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and in checks .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa requirements after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa &apos;s serum levels are much lower than serum levels obtained after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no accumulation : serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be attributed to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study on hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients ( which were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ) was not increased .
14 in animal @-@ experimental studies with nearly the 20@@ fold recommended daily dose epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced oil weight , a delay of the os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in red@@ dish mortality .
these reports support in vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation .
as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store Ab@@ se@@ amed for a period of 3 days outside the refrigerator and not exceed 25 ° C .
the sy@@ ring@@ es are provided with gradu@@ ation rings and the filling volume is indicated by a past@@ ed label , so if necessary , the measurement of sub@@ sets is possible .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of doctors who have experience in treating patients with the above indications .

134 In animal experiments with nearly the 20@@ x dose recommended for use in humans , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced weight in the oil , resulting in a delay of the os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in red@@ dish mortality .
as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store Ab@@ se@@ amed for a period of 3 days outside the refrigerator and not exceed 25 ° C .
141 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( Day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
143 . in patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration in Section 4.2 .
the increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .

prior to the market launch and in accordance with the agreement with the competent authorities of the Member States , the holder of the marketing authorization must provide the medical specialist in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmac@@ ies with the following information and materials : • Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the drug ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging supplement .
the owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that the pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and introduced in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the approval application is set up and functional before the medicine is put into circulation and as long as it is used in traffic .
the owner of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan and additional measures for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance , as well as in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2 , and to carry out Risk Management Plan pursuant to any subsequent update of the Risk Management Plan .
an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the harm@@ lessness of the drug ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ del@@ ine on Risk Management Systems for Human@@ use . &quot;
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • maintaining new information that may have an impact on current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance plan or the measures for risk reduction • within 60 days of reaching an important ( pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance or risk reduction ) mile@@ stones • on request by the E@@ MEA
• Have a heart attack or stroke in one month before your treatment - if you suffer from inst@@ able ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time occurring or increased chest pain ) - the risk of thro@@ mbo@@ sis in the veins ( deep vein thro@@ mbo@@ sis ) is present - if , for example , such a drop of blood has occurred .
they suffer from severe bleeding disturbances of the heart ( coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion ) , the cervical arter@@ ies ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , it can reach a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets within the normal range .
your doctor may conduct regular blood tests if necessary , to check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets regularly during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , dis@@ solving of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be taken into account and treated with Ab@@ se@@ amed before starting treatment .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ y was reported very rarely about ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ y after mon@@ or@@ - or years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ y , it will ab@@ ort your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in may cause problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of dying could be increased .
in case of elevated or rising potassium levels , your doctor may take into account an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically open coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs by insufficient heart performance , your doctor will make sure that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to the current findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of kidney failure .
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa drugs and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your stre@@ amed dose to keep the risk of thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be carefully weighed against the advantages derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( adi@@ p@@ ous ) or if in the past already th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events occurred ( e.g. a deep vein thro@@ mbo@@ sis or pulmon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ lis@@ m ) .
if you are a cancer patient , consider that Ab@@ se@@ amed looks like a growth factor for blood cells and may adver@@ sely affect the tumor .
if you have a larger orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined prior to the start of treatment and treated accordingly .
if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed , as there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / applied it , even if they are not prescription drugs .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may possibly order certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory studies have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are instruments for the development of the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or for HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ emia affects treatment , the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well tuned , you will receive regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ E. / kg twice a week , distributed on two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how an@@ a@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until the condition is under control .
in order to ensure that the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will conduct regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after surgery .
however , if your doctor thinks this is appropriate , you can also learn how to inj@@ ure Ab@@ se@@ amed himself under the skin .
heart , heart attack , cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , stroke , temporary isch@@ em@@ ic thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pulmon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , vascular ab@@ norm@@ alities ( an@@ eur@@ y@@ sm ) , thro@@ mbo@@ sis of the retina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients with ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment .
eye li@@ ds and lips ( Qu@@ in@@ ching ede@@ ma ) and shock @-@ like allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , heat , and accelerated pulse were reported in rare cases .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia means that there can no longer be enough red blood cells in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Special caution when using Ab@@ se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations , it can occur - irrespective of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed - to a blood cl@@ ot@@ ting ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed can be associated with an increased risk of blood pro@@ p after surgery ( post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) if your source tree is too high

when a sy@@ ringe has been taken out of the refrigerator and reached room temperature ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must either be used within 3 days or be disc@@ arded .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which makes the bones become brit@@ tle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have recently suffered a minor trau@@ matic frac@@ ture as when falling ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
for the treatment of Pa@@ get &apos;s disease , Ac@@ la@@ sta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used for evaluation of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
the first study included nearly 8@@ ,000 older women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures over a period of three years was examined .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who had recently undergone a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures has been studied over a period of up to five years .
in two trials , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two trials for 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase content in serum ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to bas@@ eline .
in the study with older women , the risk of frac@@ tures in patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years .
compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) , the risk of frac@@ ture frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 out of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most Ac@@ la@@ sta side effects occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent with repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any of the other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( loss of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
Ac@@ la@@ sta producer provides information for doctors who prescri@@ be the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains clu@@ es about how to apply the medicine , and similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the transport of Ac@@ la@@ sta across the European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic frac@@ ture .
the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • Con@@ tract contra@@ indication in pregnancy and breast@@ feeding women • The requirement of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When taking medical care or nursing care
oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic frac@@ ture .
for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men an IV in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of Pa@@ get &apos;s disease , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the disease Pa@@ get .
after treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s disease , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , according to twice daily , at least 500 m@@ g. of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days following the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by adding par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney dysfunction ( see Section 4.4 ) For patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this group of patients .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adaptation is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and young adults Ac@@ la@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , as data are missing for safety and efficacy .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before starting treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.3 ) .
because of the rapid setting of the effect of c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , the maximum normally occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , according to twice daily , at least 500 m@@ g. of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be examined before using bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
for patients who require dental implants , no data is available whether the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by adding par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of pre@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation reported as serious adverse events was increased in patients receiving Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 from 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 from 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) adverse drug interactions are listed in table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was associated with kidney dysfunction , which was referred to as a decrease of the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the changes in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually prior to submission ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a reduced kidney function were compared in a clinical study in oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of application was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta versus 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the assessment of laboratory findings , the transi@@ ent asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a recent frac@@ ture , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions following the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical study were reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as red@@ dening , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area was reported , especially in cancer patients , via oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental implants .
7 patients with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area of a patient with Ac@@ la@@ sta and a patient treated with placebo .
in the case of over@@ dose , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , a balance can be achieved by giving oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once per year for 3 consecutive years was demonstrated for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ score for the swa@@ ying dog ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric fluid frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta lowered significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new spinal frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
Ac@@ la@@ sta treated patients aged 75 years and over had a 60 % reduction in the risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta showed a consistent effect over three years which resulted in reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
the effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increases bone density in the lum@@ bar spine , hips , and the dist@@ al radius compared to the placebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 In@@ cre@@ asing the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.0 % , the lower th@@ ig@@ h by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology In the case of 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es were taken from the pel@@ vic cavity .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume and the maintenance of tra@@ be@@ cular bone architecture compared to placebo .
bone turnover marker The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during study duration .
after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Ac@@ la@@ sta was significantly reduced by 30 % compared to the bas@@ eline and was maintained at 28 % below the bas@@ eline value of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline value after 12 months and was maintained at 52 % below bas@@ eline value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below bas@@ eline value after 12 months and was maintained at 55 % below bas@@ eline value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the total mor@@ ali@@ dity was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment increased the BM@@ D at all points in comparison to placebo treatment compared to placebo treatment .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % compared to the placebo treatment by 5.@@ 4 % compared to the placebo treatment .
clinical effectiveness in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ la@@ sta patients compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the annual administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta was not inferior to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the bas@@ eline .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment with Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta was examined in patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , above all light to moderate severe morph@@ ology Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in accordance with the 2,@@ 6@@ x to 3,@@ 0@@ th age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of lac@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months has been demonstrated in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month main study ( response to therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta and 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , the therapeutic response of 141 patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 71 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , could be maintained in the mean duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
single and multiple 5 and 15 minutes permanent fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be dose independent .
thereafter , the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long period of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life time t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ = 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long period of exclusion with a terminal exclusion period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid resor@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue .
the total body Clear@@ ance is 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h , regardless of the dose and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion period from 5 to 15 minutes was reduced by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the area under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a decreased clearance of metaboli@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzymes is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolic inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
specific patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the C@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) in 64 examined patients .
this results in a slight ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney dysfunction down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance down to 35 ml / min , no dose adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid required .
as for severe kidney dys@@ functions ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data is available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal injection intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and with rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
in dogs , single doses of 1,@@ 0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C were the six times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposition ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In trials with IV application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was administered in rats , taking doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose equivalent to the thre@@ ef@@ old human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) , well tolerated .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects on other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , and the intraven@@ ous injection point were performed .
the most frequent occurrence in trials with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the metap@@ hy@@ sis of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in doses of 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed on rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low serum calcium level .

according to the CH@@ MP Directive on Risk Management Systems for Human Use , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted along with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
a revised type of R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known which could influence current safety , pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or activities to minim@@ ise the risk . • within 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) was reached .
z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is a member of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the bone Pa@@ get of the bone .
declining blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens , which are made of and@@ ro@@ gens play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass that is observed in men .
in Pa@@ get &apos;s disease , bone reconstruction takes place too quickly , and new bone material is constructed un@@ intentionally , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta works by norm@@ alizing the bone structure , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and rein@@ forcing the bone again .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you are using Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / applied , even if they are non @-@ prescription drugs .
it is particularly important for your doctor to know if you are taking pharmaceuticals that are known to harm the kidneys .
if Ac@@ la@@ sta is used together with food and beverages , you are concerned that in accordance with your doctor &apos;s instructions , you will have enough fluids before and after treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a vein .
if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical care of the hip frac@@ ture .
Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg , which is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a vein .
since Ac@@ la@@ sta works for a long time , you may need to take another dose after one year or more .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in your blood during the time after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment .
if you miss the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before the termination of the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta Falls you are considering the termination of the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next medical appointment and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion are very common ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after the subsequent in@@ fusion .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days following the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
currently it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you have received such symptoms as you have received Ac@@ la@@ sta .

persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or in the jaw were reported mainly in patients who were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates due to other diseases .
allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed adverse events affect you significantly or you notice any side effects not listed in this use information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally , 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic acet@@ ate frac@@ ture it is recommended to perform the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical care of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta patients have to be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important for patients who receive di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
because of the rapid setting of the effect of c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia can develop , the maximum normally occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , according to at least twice daily 500 m@@ g. of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .

in addition , four studies were carried out in more than 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ compli@@ a was used as a suppor@@ tive remedy for smoking compared to placebo .
on the other hand , the studies on the setting of the smoking did not show uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ compli@@ a was difficult to assess in this application area .
the most common side effects of A@@ compli@@ a , observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) , were nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and upper respiratory tract infections .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in a small minority of patients .
caution is advisable while using A@@ compli@@ a with medicines such as ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole or it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicine against fung@@ al infections ) , k@@ night avi@@ r ( a means of applying to HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , thro@@ my@@ cin or clari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . LN

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ compli@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age due to the lack of data on efficacy and safety . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depression or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in case of de@@ pressed interference , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefit of treatment in the individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
even in patients who , besides obesity , have no apparent risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur .
relatives or other related persons should point out that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms and immediately seek medical advice if these symptoms occur .
• Ol@@ der patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown sufficiently .

if Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the combination ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , no adverse effects on fertility or menstru@@ al disturbances were observed .
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was examined at the rat in doses of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , exposure to Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and lac@@ tation caused no changes in learning behaviour or memory .

summary of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public assessment report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the trials conducted to make recommendations on the use of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . it can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medication ) is not indicated .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , met@@ form@@ in can not be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily adjusted in the highest acceptable dose .
in combination with a sul@@ f@@ l resin or insulin , the present dose of the sul@@ f@@ l resin / insulin may be maintained with the beginning of the acet@@ ylene treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ f@@ l resin / insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks , which makes type 2 diabetes better .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was studied ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea , in addition , they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos resulted in a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were reduced in doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of adding ac@@ tos to the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea showed a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional administration of placebo caused a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study investigating the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 28@@ 9 patients , patients receiving Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin had a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving placebo .
the most common adverse events associated with Ac@@ tos were vision disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ es@@ thesia ( decreased sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may react hyper@@ sensitive to pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis ( high levels of ket@@ one - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a permit for placing ac@@ tos in the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , dom@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and in which met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) .
for use of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , so the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are threatened by the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. a previous heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the physician should start treating the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma if pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in reports of heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with higher output liver enzyme values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirror is increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme levels are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vomiting , upper stomach trouble , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme levels must be checked .
the decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone should be guided by clinical app@@ rais@@ al up to the presence of the laboratory parameters .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone a dose @-@ dependent weight increase was detected , which can cause fat deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction in the mean ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.1 % ) occurred during the treatment with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on as oral double or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or as a two @-@ fold combination therapy with insulin have the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch , a decrease in visual acuity was reported under the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ones , including pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone , an occurrence or worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescri@@ bing doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma if patients report disturbances of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary of reports of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active trial , a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 Fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes for a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is to be dis@@ continued ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies on interactions have shown that pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or drug dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , such as oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone with cham@@ ois ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in the AU@@ C of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone .
this is due to the fact that , under the treatment of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone , hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal are reduced and thus the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for red@@ dish growth is reduced .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequent &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( from present data not pri@@ cel@@ ess ) .
these lead to a temporary alter@@ ation of the lens and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone AL@@ T asc@@ ents more than three times the upper limit of the normal range performed equally often as under placebo , but less often than in comparison groups of met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with advanced macro@@ vascular disease , the incidence of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency under pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on was 1.6 % higher than placebo , when Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on bz@@ w .
since the market launch it has rarely been reported about con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , but more often if Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary of reports of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and over 7,@@ 400 patients were conducted in the groups treated with comparative medications .
in the Pro@@ Active trial over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with comparative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day for seven days no symptoms occurred .
pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone seems to have an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) activated in the animal model causing increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose recognition in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time to re@@ vit@@ alize the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years of therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in 69 % of patients treated ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate despite three months of optimization with insulin were random@@ ised to pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone , the medi@@ an H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c decreased by 0.@@ 45 % compared to patients receiving only insulin ; a reduction of insulin dose in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to bas@@ eline values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was examined in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical studies , compared to placebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol and a slight , but clin@@ ically not significantly elevated L@@ DL cholesterol level was observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ de reduced total plasma glucose levels and free fatty acids and elevated the HD@@ L cholesterol level .
in comparison to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was found under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone , while the values of met@@ form@@ in and g@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ de were observed .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern @-@ tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ fla@@ von@@ oid increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , this both through an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active trial , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease were random@@ ized in groups who received either Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral use , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on is resor@@ bed quickly , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone in plasma are usually reached 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to the effectiveness of about three times the effectiveness of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or drug dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone with cham@@ ois ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral use of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone in humans , the marker was found mainly in the F@@ ate ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in urine ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ elimination period of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metaboli@@ te is 16 @-@ 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone and its metaboli@@ tes are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of the oral Clear@@ ance of the mother substance are similar .
toxic studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume magni@@ fication with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that , under the treatment of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone , hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal were reduced , thus reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for red@@ dish growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder was induced .
in an animal model of family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ones resulted in increased frequency of col@@ onic tumors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active trial , a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 Fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with comparative medication .
in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or g@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d were investigated .
in clinical trials over 1 year a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ enten was statisti@@ cally significant compared to the bas@@ eline values .
in a study of 20 weeks , pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern @-@ tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ fla@@ von@@ ic increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , this both through an effect on Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study was missing the target regarding its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary ar@@ thro@@ mbo@@ sis , and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that with the intake of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone no cardiovascular long@@ term risks are connected .

Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane has been investigated in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes where the pancre@@ as does not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror indicating that the blood sugar levels were similarly lowered as with another human insulin .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( see the complete list of packages ) .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane out@@ weigh the risks associated with the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a licence for transferring Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane to the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily if a quick initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar levels have improved significantly , for example , by intensified insulin therapy can change the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change in starch , brand ( manufacturer ) , type of insulin ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or method of manufacturing ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to the animal of animal origin ) may cause a change in the dosage needed .
if a dose adaptation is required when changing to ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after adjustment .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different compared to their previous insulin .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may lead to that insulin and meals must be used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions in the therapy and ask his patients always according to other drugs taken by them .
4 Un@@ less hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in an un@@ controlled diabetes , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fruit death in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can lead to loss of consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent disturbances of the brain function and even death .
diseases of the nervous system Occ@@ a@@ sional - Periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement in blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are referred to as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are normally reversible .
5 A intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement in blood sugar levels may , however , be associated with a temporary worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy .
diseases of the skin and the sub@@ cut@@ aneous tissue Ac@@ tu@@ ally - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy An injection site may cause a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy if failed to change the settings within the injection area .
during insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( red@@ dening , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma on the injection point ) may occur .
diseases of the immune system Occ@@ a@@ sional - Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rare - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions symptoms of gener@@ alized over@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized skin rash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , gastro@@ intestinal disorders , angi@@ onic ede@@ ma , breathing difficulties , pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and fain@@ ting .
however , hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can be treated by the oral intake of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar@@ s , sweets , cookies or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a one @-@ time relief person or by glucose which is administered intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum dose is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration is up to 24 hours .
resor@@ ption The absorption profile is due to the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resor@@ ption .
a number of split ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) locations on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metaboli@@ tes formed by the split is active .
based on conventional safety har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot be identified by any particular danger to humans .

acet@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
moreover , the doses of acet@@ tra@@ p@@ id may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a licence to transfer Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id to the entire European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of fast acting insulin must be re@@ ared , then the amount of the long acting insulin .
3 If a dose adjustment is required when changing to ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after adjustment .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may lead to that insulin and meals must be used or taken at other times .
during insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( red@@ dening , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma at the injection point ) may occur .

a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients undergoing larger surgical procedures has shown that a 42 % reduced mortality ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) was reduced by intraven@@ ous Ac@@ cor@@ p@@ id ( blood sugar 4 - 6,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum dose is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total duration amounts to approximately 7 to 8 hours .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied in a smaller number ( n = 18 ) of diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 ) .
the data is limited , but suggests that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .

this can happen : • If you are inj@@ ecting too much insulin , if you eat too little or leave a meal , if you exercise more than usual physically
always set the cap of your Nov@@ o@@ Let ready @-@ made pens when it is not in use to protect it from light .
use a Nov@@ o@@ Fine injection needle to avoid contamination . • Rem@@ ove the protective flap from a Nov@@ o@@ Fine injection needle • Use the injection needle just and firmly on Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let ( Fig@@ ure A ) • With@@ draw the large outer cap of the injection needle and the inner cap of the injection needle .
proceed as follows to avoid the injection of air and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle upwards . tap a couple of times with your finger lightly against the cartridge .
if air bubbles are present , they will accumulate at the top of the cartridge • While you continue to keep the injection needle upwards , rotate the cartridge by one click in the direction of the arrow ( Fig@@ ure C ) . while the injection needle continues upwards , press the push button in ( Fig@@ ure C ) • Now pull a drop of insulin from the tip of the injection needle .
• Pu@@ t the cap back so on the finished pen that the digit is 0 opposite the dosing stamp ( Fig@@ ure D ) • Check if the push button is pressed completely .
if the push button cannot move freely , the insulin is pressed from the injection needle • The scale on the cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .
the push @-@ button moves outside while you rotate the cap • The scale under the push button ( press dial ) shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
107 • Record the highest number that you can see on the press stud • Ad@@ dress the two numbers to get the set dose • If you have set a wrong dose , turn the cap back or backwards , until you have set the correct number of units .
rotate it until the push button is down and you can feel a resistance Take the cap off and put it back so that the 0 of the dosing brand is opposite .
make sure to press the push button only during the injection • Hold down the push button after the injection , until the injection needle was pulled out of the skin .
it may be in@@ accurate • You cannot set a dose that is higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the remaining scale to estimate how much insulin is still left , but you can not use it to adjust or select your dose .

F Ke@@ ep up the flex pen with the injection needle upwards and t@@ apping a few times with your finger against the cartridge , so that existing air bubbles will accumulate at the top of the cartridge .
the dose can be corrected both upwards and down by turning the dose selection button in the appropriate direction until the correct dose is compared to the dose of the dose indicator .
aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients with signs of cryst@@ alli@@ zed deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or g@@ kin marks ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger deposits of urine that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid levels are still more than 6 mg per deci@@ liter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
there are still some cases of sei@@ zur@@ es during the first treatment months ; therefore , it is recommended that patients with Aden@@ ur@@ ic take another medicine for the prevention of sei@@ zur@@ es at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended for children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t because it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study involving 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients , the effectiveness of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( placebo ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were under 6 mg / dl during the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who received 80 mg once daily in a dose and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who received 120 mg once a day in the last three measurements showed a ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was the case with 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhea , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver enzymes .
in particular , patients with heart problems in pre@@ history may also have an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but could also have a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to deposits ( including a well known or currently present pal@@ sy node and / or rheum@@ atic arthritis ) .
if the serum res@@ is@@ tivity retains &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase on AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x can be considered daily .
for patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not yet been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
since there are no experiences with children and adolescents , the application of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended .
since there are no experiences with organ transplan@@ ts , the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure , the treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other hard @-@ acid medicines , an acute g@@ out attack can occur during the treatment process , because the reduction of the serum levels can first mobili@@ se ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue .
B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , les@@ ch@@ - n@@ ine syndrome ) the absolute concentration of x@@ an@@ thin in the urine rarely increases so far in the urine that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical studies , mild symptoms of liver function were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function before beginning of the f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ sta@@ sis and in the subsequent course of the liver ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ was did not have interactions with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ ory can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ lic mirror ( a blocking of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
subjects were the simultaneous administration of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ex@@ exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without any dose adaptation required for f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient used at the same time .
in a study with subjects 120@@ mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x had an average 22 % increase in AU@@ C from Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at to the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
ant@@ acids It could be shown that the simultaneous sei@@ zure of an ant@@ acid containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed the absorption of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and a decrease in C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies can not be related to side effects of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born baby .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , operating of machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiac events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the total f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ sta@@ group in the pi@@ v@@ ot study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 vs. 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors observed in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) adverse events that occurred in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all of the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once , are listed below .
diar@@ rhea , nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are treated with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In the clinical studies no serious rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 open long @-@ term extension studies included 90@@ 6 patients up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events related to treatment during long @-@ term renewal studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients receiving F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the indications .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in pi@@ vot@@ al studies in phase 3 or with a lower frequency :
diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , in@@ som@@ nia , hyp@@ es@@ thesia , conspic@@ uous E@@ KG , cou@@ gh@@ ing , short@@ ness of skin , protein ur@@ ia , ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , erectile dysfunction , increase in potassium concentration in the blood , decrease of TS@@ H concentrations in the blood , decrease of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te number , decrease in the number of white blood cells .
ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the Pur@@ in@@ metabolism in humans and arises as part of the reaction cas@@ cade hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) inhibit@@ or with a K@@ i value for in vitro @-@ in@@ hibition that lies beneath the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range .
clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( A@@ PE@@ X study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month @-@ monthly ser@@ um acid levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a serum cre@@ atine value at the beginning of study &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the A@@ PE@@ X study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the lowering of the serum pole on &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor &apos;s visit in week 2 and kept permanently over the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum supple@@ mentation &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub @-@ group of patients with kidney dysfunction The A@@ PE@@ X study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( i.e. , h ) .
AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was the primary efficacy end@@ point of 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage decline of the serum har@@ n@@ acid concentrations in subjects , irrespective of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub @-@ group of patients with ser@@ um acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l. of the patients ( A@@ PE@@ X and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data from the open extension study of Phase 3 demonstrated that the permanent reduction of serum levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of g@@ out attacks , so that less than 3 % of patients needed 16 @-@ 24 treatment against rheum@@ atic supplies ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not need treatment against rheum@@ atism ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the pal@@ sy size , which in 54 % of patients resulted in a complete disappearance of the g@@ noc@@ chi up to month 24 .
advanced TS@@ H values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .

for doses of between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple or@@ ally doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,@@ 0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant changes were observed in the percentage decrease in the serum resin concentration provided this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 litres after doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma concentration of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is about 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration range achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .

these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ metaboli@@ zation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day , f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which bones become brit@@ tle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of a low vitamin D level .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irritation of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
as al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already separated from each other in medicines approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than for those who only received al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data that stipul@@ ate that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( digestive disorders ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia ( swal@@ lowing ) , infl@@ ated abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated stomach ) as well as aci@@ dic b@@ umping .
in patients with allergic hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other ingredients AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be applied .
it may not be applied in case of diseases of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission granted Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ a Ltd. to apply AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE for placing AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE across the European Union .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should only be swal@@ lowed with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth since there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • Pati@@ ents should not lie down before the first intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cers , active gastro@@ intestinal ble@@ ed@@ ings or surgical interventions in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ opla@@ sty can only be given special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al lines , were reported in patients taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out in the presence of symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn , and seek medical advice ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of serious es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine properly and / or take it after the occurrence of symptoms that point to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was detected , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cers were rare ( after market release ) , among them some severe and severe complications ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regi@@ men mainly contains intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there are no data available indicating whether the treatment of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients with a max@@ illary surgery reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is crucial for the treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that if they miss a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE they should take the tablet the next morning after notic@@ ing their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but should continue taking one tablet a week as originally planned on the scheduled day of the week .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately before starting treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids , and some oral medicines may affect the resor@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other drugs ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials along with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or lac@@ t@@ ating women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate leave no indication of directly damaging effects in terms of pregnancy that detect embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports come from cancer patients but also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
however , the serum calcium intake decreased to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / l ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the serum phosph@@ ate to ≤ 2.0 mg / l ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate In@@ sequence of oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .
Col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D@@ 3 ) vitamin D@@ 3 is produced in the skin by UV light through the conversion of 7 @-@ Deh@@ y@@ dro@@ mes to Vitamin D@@ 3 .
the main effect of vitamin D@@ 3 is to increase intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of calcium and calcium , ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone resor@@ ption .
in severe cases , a lack of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia , weakness of the proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ y can lead to a further increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in oste@@ opor@@ otic individuals .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) significantly lowered the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency after 15 weeks ( serum value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D &lt; 37@@ ,5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 ng / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2,5 % compared to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs .
the therapeutic equivalent of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate once a week 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg daily ( n = 3@@ 70 ) was demonstrated in a one @-@ year multi@@ center study of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and in the frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6,@@ 4@@ 59 ) .

the two @-@ year extension of these studies continued to maintain the BM@@ D &apos;s asc@@ ents from the spine and the tro@@ chan@@ ter ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled studies where Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 m@@ g. a day over 2 years and then 10 m@@ g. daily for either 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily gift of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new spinal frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % versus placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .

bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken one or half an hour prior to a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy subjects , oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant changes in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 Distribution studies on rats have shown that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is distributed temporarily in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous injection of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly re@@ distributed to the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the radioactive substances were ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the woods .
following an intraven@@ ous injection of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic Clear@@ ance did not exceed 200 ml / min .

adv@@ agra@@ f is administered to adult patients who have been transplan@@ ted to a kidney or liver to prevent the immune system from being re@@ pul@@ sed by the immune system .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already being used in the EU , the company has presented the results of previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplantation , using adv@@ agra@@ f with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after one year of treatment ( for example , by examining how often a new organ transplan@@ t or a resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , further studies of 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t were carried out and examined how adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .
tre@@ mor , headache , nausea , vomiting , diar@@ rhea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar levels ( hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ) , diabetes , increased potassium content ( hypertension ) , high blood pressure ( hypertension ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients , Adv@@ anc@@ f may not be applied .
patients and doctors must be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines should be taken at the same time with adv@@ agra@@ f , as the Adv@@ ant@@ f dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adjusted accordingly .
hard capsules , ret@@ ards yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atin capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow capsule upper part with &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; and on the orange capsule bottom with &quot; D@@ 6@@ 47 &quot; ; they contain white powder .
only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formula and appropriate daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close inspection of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose modifications must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the dosage of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adv@@ anc@@ f &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood level measurements ( see below &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Recommen@@ dations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ anc@@ f , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus fe@@ at mirror should be controlled before the change@@ over and over two weeks after adjustment .
on Day 4 , systemic exposure was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated inspections of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus fe@@ e@@ ders are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t under Adv@@ anc@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate night@@ mare plan@@ ing phase .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clearance , adjusting the advance dose can take several days before reaching the steady state .
if the patient &apos;s condition is not permitted in the first postoperative period , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml Con@@ centr@@ ate to produce an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application In order to supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dose recommendations - K@@ id@@ ney Transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral advance treatment should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dose adjustments may be necessary , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change during the course of stabili@@ sing the patient after transplantation .
dose recommendations - Li@@ ver Transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral advance treatment should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - The conversion of Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ anc@@ f must be changed from Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules once daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to one once daily intake of adv@@ agra@@ f , so this change@@ over has to take place at a ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ t After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to advance daily , the treatment must begin with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplantation for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplan@@ t In adult patients who are converted to advance , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day in the morning .
other gra@@ fts , although there is no clinical experience with adv@@ agra@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ectal cancer patients , was used in a oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in pancre@@ atic transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adap@@ tations in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function For the maintenance of blood vessels in the targeted area , a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions .
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not necessary .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the serum cre@@ atine levels , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ ine in@@ adequ@@ acies and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
switch from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ anc@@ f In switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy caution is advised ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the recommended dose should be based primarily on the clinical app@@ rais@@ al of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the help of full blood @-@ bloo@@ ded tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tests .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ blood @-@ blood @-@ levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after conversion of pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ agra@@ f , dose adaptation , changes of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or concur@@ rent application of substances which might change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus whole blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ anc@@ f is a low @-@ cost drug , adjustments can take several days until Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the levels of blood in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the whole blood are usually in the area of 5 - 20 ng / ml and kidney transplan@@ ts - and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which can occur in the wake of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under or over exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formula and appropriate daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close inspection of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be refrac@@ tory to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data for the retard@@ ant formulation could be found .
in order to pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ ts and gra@@ ft recipients in childhood , no clinical data for the retard@@ ant formulation could be found .
due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the use of herbal supplements , the St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other herbal remedies can be avoided during treatment with adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea an especially careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is offered , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , an anterior chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy referred to as cardi@@ omy@@ opathy was observed , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ anc@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the potential risk of mal@@ ig@@ ner skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients who are taking Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus have symptoms for PRE@@ S such as headache , altered state of consciousness , cra@@ mps and blur@@ red vision , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
since adv@@ agra@@ f hard capsules , ret@@ ard@@ ess , lac@@ tose conc@@ ur , special caution is required in patients with the rare heredi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies that are known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore advisable to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while also offering substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose for maintaining concur@@ rent concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ chemical antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal contamination .
high @-@ dose pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that can be metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence their metabolism .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormone exposure , decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures should be particularly cau@@ tious .
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus potentially l@@ essen the Clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ one and extend their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients have no indication that under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in the uter@@ o exposition , a monitoring of the new@@ born refers to possible damaging effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ kal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence of 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants can often not be determined precisely because of the patient &apos;s underlying disease and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other drugs .
the side effects following their frequency are listed in descending order : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , sometimes ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) .

cases of associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with adv@@ agra@@ f .
it was reported about ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V @-@ associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative disorders and skin tumors in connection with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water solu@@ bility and the high binding on ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plas@@ map@@ rot@@ ein , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can not be di@@ aly@@ zed .
action mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be medi@@ ated by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ oli@@ an protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cell nucle@@ us .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um- based in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ks genes .

175 patients who submitted a pancre@@ atic transplan@@ t in 4@@ 75 patients who underwent a pancre@@ atic transplan@@ t in 6@@ 30 cases as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant .
overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was consistent with these published studies in the large studies where pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients .
lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi @-@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was reported over 110 patients who received either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oliti@@ s obli@@ ter@@ ans@@ - syndrome , was also observed in the first year after transplantation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) , patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus were in 2@@ 1,7 % of cases for the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oliti@@ s obli@@ ter@@ ans .
the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 0.@@ 02 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were converted by Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute rejection rate was greater after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the treatment plan patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the frequency of the onset of a bron@@ chi@@ oliti@@ s obli@@ ter@@ ic syndrome in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly lower .
a multi @-@ centric study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was carried out to 205 patients who underwent a pancre@@ as and kidney transplantation , who received Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) after a random@@ ised procedure .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study of oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ im@@ transplan@@ ts showed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the un@@ bound group of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or a strengthening of metabolism induced by cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids are to be responsible for higher clearing rates observed after the transplan@@ t .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , with ex@@ cre@@ tion predominantly via the bile .
the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ anc@@ f was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f in case of stable patients ( once daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) compared to the total daily dose .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be refrac@@ tory to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data for the retard@@ ant formulation could be found .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma .
in the first 24 weeks of the Adv@@ anc@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) , 28 confirmed ev@@ ac@@ uation was 32.@@ 6 % and 29.@@ 3 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) .

lawyers are used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II , con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder ) .
dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether lawyers are used to treat ble@@ ed@@ ings or to prevent ble@@ ed@@ ings in surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced using a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced into which it enables the formation of the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II .
adv@@ ate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but it is otherwise produced so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and for surgical procedures .
the main study evaluated the efficacy of adv@@ ates in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new bleeding episodes with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of adv@@ ates ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II .
advance may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the placing of lawyers in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of VI@@ II deficiency , the location and extent of the hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events the factor VI@@ II activity should not fall under the indicated plasma level ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ U. / dl ) during the corresponding period of time .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk is over for the patient .
in the course of treatment , a proper determination of VI@@ II plasma levels is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients may differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses of 20 to 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg of body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected Factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures need to be considered .
the dose should be directed at the patient &apos;s level , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II Ig@@ G immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma with modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of inhibit@@ ing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to VI@@ II , where the risk is greatest within the first 20 exposure days and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ nes@@ ian well @-@ known inhibit@@ or development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product to another , re@@ occurrence of ( low tri@@ g@@ gering ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women there is no experience about the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
A@@ DR@@ s were inhibit@@ ors to VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all of which occurred in previously untreated patients who exhibit higher risk of inhibit@@ ing , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) The unexpected drop of the co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II @-@ mirror occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10th - 14th postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - Spiegel in the plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed adequate values again on the 15th day of the day .

in addition , none of the 53 Pedi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) were observed with VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or .
in previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical trial 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated patients treated with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE treated inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II .
the immune response of patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ ter against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as sustained peak of the antibody @-@ level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicated on an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the presence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ loc@@ y@@ tes was reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP still rated the benefit @-@ risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE &apos;s safety profile , which makes P@@ SU@@ R@@ s mandatory every 6 months , and decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited submitted the CH@@ MP to the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company withdraw@@ s its application for the transfer of lawyer to Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissue ( tissue that connects and supports other structures in the body ) is affected .
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that it cannot produce copies of oneself and thus can cause infections in humans .
Adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tumors , enabling the cancer cells to re@@ construct the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the p@@ 53 gene that is not defective in the human body , usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered .
with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer performed in the area of the abdom@@ en , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP reviewed the company &apos;s responses to the questions asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on the review of the documents submitted , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of adv@@ a in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ our provides benefits for patients .
the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is not harmful to the environment or for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal will have consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate @-@ use &quot; programs with adv@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; altered drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is immediately released and the other slowly releases over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation caused by allergies to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents 12 years old , the recommended dose of Aer@@ of@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ oned .
treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug may be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measurements were the changes in sever@@ ity of hay fever symptoms recorded by patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all ha@@ y@@ fever symptoms except con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients receiving Aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze reported a 4@@ 6.0 % decrease in symptoms compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who had pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients showed a reduction of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who took des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of a@@ verages ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ asing ) , dr@@ y@@ ness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another drug for treating allergies ) .
it may not be applied to patients suffering from an angle glaucoma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hypertension caused by cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis ) or have a risk of a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a licence for the transfer of Aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze to the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water but can be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without tear@@ ing it up , breaking or chew@@ ing ) .
Aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze should not be used for children under the age of 12 due to the lack of data on harm@@ lessness and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have stopped .
it is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days , as long @-@ term application can reduce the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment may be continued with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as a mon@@ otherapy .
da Aer@@ ini@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within the 2 weeks after the completion of such a therapy .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ eg@@ ot@@ amine , d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiva , which can be intra@@ or@@ ally or nas@@ al than thres@@ holds of Rhin@@ opla@@ sty ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pane , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not been checked for this patient &apos;s collective and the data is not sufficient to address recommendations for the dosage .
safety and efficacy of Aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is insufficient to address recommendations for dosage .
patients must be informed that the treatment in case of hyper@@ ton@@ ia or ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headaches or aug@@ mentation of the headaches ) must be stopped .
caution is advised in the treatment of the following patient groups : • Pati@@ ents with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as • Pati@@ ents with hypertension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , bladder neck ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
Aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze is to be replaced at least 48 hours prior to performing der@@ mat@@ ological testing , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines can otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or to reduce them to their extent .
in the course of clinical tests with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor testing no significant differences could be found between patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with placebo , regardless of whether or not they were taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit in vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ os@@ ols during pregnancy is not guaranteed , but experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies did not result in an increase in the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
as reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze should not be applied during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , which can lead to impair@@ ment of the ability of transport or the ability to operate machinery .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S @-@ depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible nas@@ al processes .
headache , anxiety , panic disorder , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , euph@@ oria , arous@@ al , breathing in@@ suffici@@ ency , heart rhythm disorders , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vomiting , pre@@ cor@@ di@@ ale pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , blur@@ red vision and hypertension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
a CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mou@@ th@@ dry , pup@@ il rigi@@ dity and - di@@ lation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include the in@@ hibition of the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of expression of the adhesi@@ on molecules P @-@ sel@@ ess to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the gli@@ ding , including ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo was determined .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause other symp@@ athetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifest@@ ations of CN@@ S arous@@ al .
there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of a@@ ze tablets , determined by the overall score for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the wa@@ vering effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets did not show significant differences with regard to patient sub@@ sets defined by gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
as part of a single dose study on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics by Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of the administration of the plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow equivalent weight of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached by day 10 .
within the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were badly metaboli@@ sed .
a component interaction study shows that the exposition ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the exclusive gift of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine is equivalent to exposure to the application of an aer@@ of@@ a@@ ze tablet .
however , based on conventional safety har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n however do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits at a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and the Pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system described in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the approval application is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the relief of allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , to develop its effect .
a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms that occur in connection with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating the nose .

tell your doctor if you are experiencing or diagnos@@ ing the following symptoms or diseases when using Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze : • High blood pressure • Cardi@@ ac disease , pal@@ pit@@ ations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headaches or strengthening of existing headaches .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other drugs or have recently taken , even if they are non @-@ prescription drugs .
when applying at the recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that Aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze will lead to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness or reduce the attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform immediately your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze than you should .
if you forgot to take a dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze If you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the appropriate time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed adverse events affect you significantly or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
heart hunting , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , sore throat , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in the urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness and di@@ zz@@ iness .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n very rarely was reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves rash and swelling ) or rash .
cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart hunting , stomach pain , nausea , vomiting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disorders , muscle pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , cases of liver inflammation and cases of notable liver enzymes were also rarely reported .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate for intake ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup and respectively .
for children between the ages of six and eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies of patients who had asthma ) .
efficacy was measured by determining the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ rant , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance in the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been presented to demonstrate that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution for intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in symptom scores ( symptom points ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease in 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a placebo .
in the two trials of Ur@@ tic@@ aria the decrease in the symptom was after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo .
eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a licence for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies to efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease course and can be termin@@ ated after the symptoms have been completed and resum@@ ed at their re@@ occurring .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , the patient may be advised during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that , in very rare cases , it can lead to drow@@ sin@@ ess , which can lead to impair@@ ment of the transport capacity or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events reported in placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 young patients aged between 12 and 17 years , the most common adverse event was headache , which occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study that was administered up to 45 mg .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesi@@ on molecules P @-@ sel@@ ess to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects were described as part of a clinical study with multi @-@ dose boxes in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day for 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the Clinical dosage ) for more than ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval indicated itself .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the gli@@ ding , including ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear flow , and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established as@@ is@@ onal and per@@ ennial classification , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can alternatively be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of symptoms .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as was demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was examined for further forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology despite the eti@@ ology of the different forms is similar and chronic patients can be easily pro@@ spec@@ tively recru@@ ited .
since hist@@ amine is a caus@@ ative factor in all cosmetic diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n results in an improvement of the symptoms in other forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria in other forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of no@@ od@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria the minority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
an improvement of the it@@ ching rate by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ efulness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other drugs are not entirely excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n at a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional research on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n reveal no particular dangers to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there is no data available to support an infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis of an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metaboli@@ ze Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience a higher level of substance ( see under section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years that limit metaboli@@ ze is identical to that of children who metaboli@@ se normally .
this medicine contains sac@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ - in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol , alcohol has not increased the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as in the placebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study involving adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg .
children aged between 1 and 11 who were eligible for anti @-@ hist@@ amine treatment received a daily dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects were described as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day for 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the Clinical dosage ) for ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval indicated itself .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents showed no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
in a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not interfere with psych@@ om@@ otor skills .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol did not result in ampli@@ fication of the alcohol @-@ induced deterioration of the performance or an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adults and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear flow , and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the induced seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of no@@ od@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this limited metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose study involving sy@@ rup formation in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that limit metaboli@@ ze .
the strain ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of about 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant drug accumulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies , AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were comparable with pedi@@ atric patients at the recommended doses compared to those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded .

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets daily put in the mouth to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies to efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
immediately before application , the bli@@ ster has to be carefully opened and the dose of the melt tablet is removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years has not been proven until now .
the overall incidence of adverse events between the plac@@ ebo@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was the same and did not significantly decrease the safety profile established in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s cruci@@ ble tablet proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate to the neh@@ men@@ - formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .

the spread of this badly metaboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) larger than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( A@@ wak@@ se 2 % , children 3 % ) , however , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
in single dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melt tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate for intake , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ atric patients , but in conjunction with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting trays support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which are metaboli@@ sed , is identical to that of children who metaboli@@ se normally .
this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to that of the Plac@@ ebo group .
the most common adverse events reported in small children between 6 and 23 months were diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2.3 % ) .
in an additional study , at a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no side effects were observed in patients between 6 and 11 years of age .
at the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see under section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents showed no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
in addition to the established z@@ as@@ onal and per@@ ennial classification , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively also occur in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of symptoms .
as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the strain caused by seasonal or allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

the 150 ml pack size is a measuring sco@@ op or an application sy@@ ringe f@@ û@@ r preparation for inser@@ ting with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml doses .
June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. once approved the CH@@ MP Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company withdraw@@ s its application for the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people to protect against influenza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine meant to protect against a strain of the flu virus causing a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from human to human , because humans have not yet built up immunity .
after administ@@ ering the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system will later be able to form antibodies using a flu virus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; subsequently , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; membrane ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognis@@ es as a body extern@@ ally ) , was puri@@ fied and used as part of the vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; Good Clinical Practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are taking part in a clinical trial and need further information on your treatment , please contact your attending physician .
if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ val@@ ase is available as a solution for intake , but it cannot be taken together with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ val@@ et should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked out which anti@@ viral drugs the patient has previously taken , and the likel@@ ihood of the virus will respond to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with twice daily 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral medicines .
for children between four and twelve years old and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ val@@ ase is based on body weight .
in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , A@@ val@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS cannot cure , but can delay the damage to the immune system and also the development of AIDS @-@ related infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without k@@ night avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had not previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
it was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used to use prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who had previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in viral load after treatment .
in studies with patients who had not previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had less than 400 copies / ml than placebo after 48 weeks , but A@@ val@@ ase was less effective than ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ a also reduced the viral load , but the children who had previously been treated with ease inhibit@@ ors only responded very few to the treatment .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the medicine A@@ val@@ ase reinforced with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r came to a stronger decrease in viral load after four weeks compared to patients who continued to take up their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of ap@@ hor@@ ism ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( blo@@ ating ) , nausea , vomiting , rash and fatigue .
2 / 3 A@@ gen@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
ag@@ re@@ ase may also not be used in patients who are taking Johannis@@ kraut ( an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or drugs that are broken down as well as ag@@ re@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other drugs against HIV , there is a risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( loss of bone tissue ) or an immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ juven@@ ating immune system ) .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children out@@ weigh the risks for more than four years .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of ag@@ gregation in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have not previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors has not been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Company G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited a permit for the placing of ads across the European Union .
A@@ val@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) previously treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should usually be administered for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place taking account of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; hence , A@@ val@@ ase capsules and solution for gaining on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ val@@ ase capsules is 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 If A@@ val@@ ase capsules are used without the intensi@@ fying addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of A@@ val@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ val@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of ag@@ gregation in combination with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children .
ag@@ re@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to the lack of data on harm@@ lessness and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ val@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function problems to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be done with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ generic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic lati@@ tude and also present sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enz@@ ym@@ atic 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
the patients should be pointed out that ap@@ generic or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including the treatment with aspir@@ in , does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ generative capsules should be used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver @-@ side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
in the event of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show increased frequency of liver dysfunction under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ val@@ ase and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is highly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , an simultaneous administration of ap@@ pre@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended due to the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some drugs that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
in patients who are taking these drugs at the same time , as@@ par@@ ase may be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , but the information is insufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are also administered .
because of the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high level of propylene gly@@ co@@ l content , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient populations .
if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us .
many of the patients had other illnesses whose therapy needed medicines to be associated with the development of diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. Higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti @-@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase of ble@@ ed@@ ings including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis occur .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can develop at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , leading to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is assumed ( including cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) were reported .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic lati@@ tude must not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic lati@@ tude and also present sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enz@@ ym@@ atic 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ val@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with drugs whose active ingredients are metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in the attempt to compensate the reduced plasma levels by a dose @-@ increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be degra@@ ded by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if one patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus levels and , if possible , check the viral load and replace the St. John &apos;s wort .
dose adjustment for one of the drugs is not required when nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x , by contrast , reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day , demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment plan .
52 % lower when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and safety of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study on the use of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , however , due to the an@@ ta@@ zi@@ di component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , it is recommended that the revenues of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and aspir@@ in are at least one hour apart ( see an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure to both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may reduce the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised as Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
caution is advised if these drugs are used together ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be carried out , since precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ ine is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase in side effects associated with Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ val@@ ase , a reduction in the dose of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin should be at least half the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available for this .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with ag@@ gregation in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been performed , however , the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of concur@@ rent administration .
simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of C@@ MA@@ x of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) compared to the value that was observed once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other drugs listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can potentially lead to interactions if they are used together with A@@ val@@ ase .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with A@@ val@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as A@@ val@@ ase as it can come to resor@@ ption in@@ som@@ nia .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants known as enzyme duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to degradation of the plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , an@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ation with A@@ val@@ ase can significantly increase the plasma concentrations and intensi@@ fy the effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , blur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels rose by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous administration of A@@ val@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the case of H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in plasma levels are to be expected in simultaneous administration of ap@@ hor@@ ism .
since plasma levels of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirror is recommended , as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ val@@ et may not be used together with or@@ ally taken Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while caution is advised with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am concur@@ r@@ ently .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are also administered .
because of the low reliability of historic compar@@ isons there is no recommendation at the moment , as the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus dose can be adjusted if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with the simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ val@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are also recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with concur@@ rent as@@ gener@@ acy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful balancing of the possible benefits to the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the lac@@ tose @-@ free rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether or not am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the loss in the uter@@ us to the end of the breast@@ feeding time of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished 12 body weight during lac@@ tation .
the further development of po@@ sterity , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mat@@ ernal animal .
the harm@@ lessness of a@@ Gen@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most side effects associated with the treatment of A@@ gen@@ ase were mild to moderate , rose early and rarely led to a treatment break .
many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with taking A@@ val@@ or or another drug at the same time , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects mentioned below stem from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg A@@ val@@ ase twice daily .
events ( grade 2 to 4 ) , which were assessed by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as laboratory changes occurring during the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and facial su@@ bret@@ inal fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ @-@ cervical fat accumulation .
among 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated individuals who had been treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ din / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( bull@@ do@@ cks ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s were treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients with ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s for an average duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
cut@@ aneous r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or macro@@ sc@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching , and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be abor@@ ted .
cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can develop at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre@@ treated patients receiving 600 mg A@@ val@@ ase twice a day with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) , which were observed in patients who received A@@ val@@ ase together with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were often observed .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient may be exposed to signs of intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures can be initiated .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral g@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ e- poly@@ proteins with the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro vs HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ p Con@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages were treated - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r geb@@ oo@@ st@@ erten treatment schemes with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre@@ treated patients receiving 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred until week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of 13 of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients , with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors not pre @-@ treated patients , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .

gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing based analyses can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / k@@ night on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / F , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced likel@@ ihood of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ational patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for analy@@ sing the results of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing , clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / k@@ night on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
firms that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( isol@@ ating points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns generates a certain cross resistance against rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on cross resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance trails , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre@@ treated patients in which a Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus ( containing three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) appear .
conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early departure of any therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that may have a detri@@ mental effect on subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ acy in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which PI pre @-@ treated adults ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ cle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly bra@@ ised with low @-@ dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ val@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison with the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the virus load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ inf@@ low threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ brid@@ led ast@@ gener@@ acy is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were previously treated with PI .
in the studies A@@ generic solution for intake and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low dose of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s associated with A@@ val@@ ase .
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to bas@@ eline .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on these data , treatment optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children should be considered for the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ag@@ gene@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % increased , by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) was un@@ affected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous food intake imp@@ acted the extent and rate of resor@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume and an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active component fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval , depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration in the Ste@@ ady State across the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and present a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time as A@@ val@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ generative capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; hence , A@@ val@@ ase solution and A@@ generative capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
the ren@@ al clearance of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible , so the effect of a kidney function disorder should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those observed in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily with no simultaneous administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , the male animals used ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas at dos@@ ages representing the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) exposure to humans , after twice daily doses of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the current exposure data to humans , both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , which included bacterial reverse mut@@ ations tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and detected in clinical daily life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of ap@@ pre@@ m@@ ics nor after the end of the treatment .
toxic@@ ity studies on juven@@ iles treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to therapeutic doses in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , indicating delayed development .
24 If A@@ val@@ ase capsules are used without the intensi@@ fying addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of A@@ val@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ val@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous use should be done with caution in patients with weak or slight liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some drugs that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of lip@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug addic@@ tive factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x , by contrast , reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure to both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
caution is advised if these drugs are used together ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be carried out , since precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ ine is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ val@@ ase , a reduction in the dose of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin will be recommended to at least half the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available for this .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , an@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
in a clinical study in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels rose by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with the simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ val@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of or@@ tho @-@ nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a 22 % decrease in AU@@ C and c@@ min of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied after careful balancing of the possible benefits to the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , given by the loss in the uter@@ us to the end of the breast@@ feeding time of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during lac@@ tation .
the harm@@ lessness of a@@ Gen@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient may be exposed to signs of intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures can be initiated .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro vs HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ p Con@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , treatment optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children should be considered for the benefit of &quot; un@@ born &quot; ag@@ gene@@ tics .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active component fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval , depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration in the Ste@@ ady State across the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss ..
therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and present a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time as A@@ val@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al clearance of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of a kidney function disorder should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , the male animals used ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas at dos@@ ages , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) exposure to humans after twice daily doses of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the current exposure data to humans , both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ations test ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mice lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
toxic@@ ity studies on juven@@ iles treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in young animals the metabolism paths are not yet fully developed , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ generic solution for recording has not been proven with PI pre@@ treated patients either with PI pre@@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; hence , A@@ val@@ ase capsules and solution for gaining on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should , once they are able to swallow the capsules , stop taking the solution to intake ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
additionally , since no dose recommendation can be given for simultaneous use of A@@ generic solution for intake and low @-@ dose k@@ night avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these groups of patients .
although a dose adaptation for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ generic solution for intake in patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high gly@@ co@@ l content , A@@ val@@ ase is a solution for entering small children and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure .
concur@@ rent administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of drug metabolism and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
the patients should be pointed out that ap@@ generic or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including the treatment with aspir@@ in , does not prevent the risk of 47 a transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some drugs that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
ag@@ re@@ ase should be removed permanently if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk for a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug 49 dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase of ble@@ ed@@ ings including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis occur .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x , by contrast , reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous sei@@ zure with A@@ val@@ et can considerably increase plasma concentrations and with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with adverse events including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , blur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
based on the data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution to intake may not be applied to the prop@@ yl@@ eng@@ ly@@ co@@ l contained in the fet@@ us due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.3 ) .
in the lac@@ tose @-@ free rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether or not am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the loss in the uter@@ us to the end of the breast@@ feeding time of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight during lac@@ tation .
the harm@@ lessness of a@@ Gen@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with taking A@@ val@@ or or another drug at the same time , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages were treated - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r geb@@ oo@@ st@@ erten treatment schemes with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
the early departure of a dis@@ counted 60 therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that may have a detri@@ mental effect on subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on these data , the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ag@@ gene@@ tics should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows a large c@@ ous@@ se volume and an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .

your doctor will normally instruc@@ t you to apply A@@ val@@ ase capsules along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to enhance the effect of ag@@ re@@ ase .
the use of A@@ val@@ et will be based on the individual viral resistance test carried out by your doctor and your history of treatment .
tell your doctor if you are suffering from one of the above mentioned diseases or taking any of the drugs mentioned above .
if your doctor has recommended that you take A@@ val@@ ase capsules together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the effect ( boo@@ ster ) , make sure you have carefully read the use information for rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r before starting treatment .
there are also no sufficient information to recommend the use of A@@ val@@ ase capsules together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to increase the efficiency of children between 4 and 12 years , or generally in patients under 50 kg body weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is important that you read the section entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; When taking A@@ generic Conf@@ lic@@ t with other drugs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before starting A@@ val@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;

if you have taken larger amounts of ap@@ hor@@ ism than you should have taken if you have taken more than the prescribed dose of ap@@ generic , you should immediately contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ generic solution for recording has been documented neither in patients treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors or with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the use of low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( usually used to strengthen the effect &#91; boo@@ ster &#93; of A@@ val@@ ase capsules ) along with A@@ val@@ ase solution for intake , no dosage recommendations can be given .

important information about certain other components of A@@ generic solution for taking The solution to intake contains propylene gly@@ co@@ l , which can result in high doses of side effects .
propylene gly@@ co@@ l can cause a number of side effects including sei@@ zur@@ es , ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , pal@@ pit@@ ations and the reduction of red blood cells ( see also A@@ gener@@ a must not be taken , Parti@@ cular caution when taking A@@ val@@ ase is necessary precau@@ tions ) .
if you forgot to take A@@ val@@ or If you forgot to take A@@ val@@ or , take it once you think about it and then continue taking it as before .
headache , fain@@ ting diar@@ rhea , feeling of illness , vomiting , blo@@ ating skin rash ( redness , bli@@ sters or it@@ ching ) - sometimes the rash may be of serious nature and force you to stop taking this medication .
this can include fat loss on legs , arms , and face , fat l@@ ame in the abdom@@ en and other internal organs , breast aug@@ mentation and fat wa@@ stes in the neck ( &quot; bull &apos;s teeth &quot; ) .
the other ingredients are propylene gly@@ co@@ l , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ( polye@@ thylene gly@@ co@@ l 400 ) , To@@ co@@ fer@@ sol@@ an ( T@@ P@@ GS ) , Sac@@ char@@ in sodium , sodium chlori@@ de , artificial gum grape aroma , sodium chlori@@ de , cit@@ ric acid , sodium cit@@ rate d@@ ih@@ y@@ dra@@ t , puri@@ fied water .
the application frequency and the duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied five times a week for six weeks . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , it is available three times a week during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles .
the cream can be applied thin@@ ly to the affected areas of the skin before bed@@ time , so that it will remain on the skin for a long time ( about eight hours ) before being washed off .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two trials , in which patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or placebo were either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tumor after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies of a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis .
• In all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the total treatment rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with al@@ dar@@ a . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete recovery rate of 66 % to 80 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a in comparison to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in over 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p in immuno@@ competent adults , if the size or number of les@@ ions limit the efficacy and / or the acceptance of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
apply Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tu@@ es@@ days , Thurs@@ days and Satur@@ days before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is to continue until all visible genital war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ anal@@ ges@@ ia , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
inter@@ ruption in the treatment process described above should be considered if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if after the follow up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated les@@ ions were only incomplete , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is left out , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual treatment plan .
apply i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in a thin layer and rub in the puri@@ fied skin area infected with cow@@ ards until the cream is fully absorbed .
it should take place in these patients between the benefits of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should take place in these patients between the benefits of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
in other studies where no daily auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case were observed with circumc@@ ision leading to circumc@@ ision .
in an application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irritation were observed , which required treatment and / or have led to temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the outlet of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulties with ur@@ ination , which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately following treatment with other cut@@ aneous medications used for treatment of external genital war@@ ts in the genital and peri@@ anal@@ ges@@ ia , no clinical experience has been reported so far .
limited data suggest a higher rate of suscep@@ ti@@ bility reductions in HIV @-@ positive patients , but i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lower efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the elimination of ti@@ lt war@@ ts .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips or the hair@@ line was not studied .
local skin reactions are frequent but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or the reactions form after completion of the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary because of the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the sever@@ ity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy may be assessed after the recovery of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered with super @-@ artificial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
there are no clinical experience in patients with recur@@ rent and previously treated BC@@ Cs , therefore the use of previously untreated tumors is not recommended .
data from an open clinical trial suggest that large tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) reduce the likel@@ ihood of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lips .
there are only very limited data on the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses in anatom@@ ical positions outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis on the under@@ arms and hands does not support the effectiveness in this application , therefore such application is not recommended .
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually take off in the course of therapy or go back after the therapy with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reactions cause severe discomfort to the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days .
from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 acne les@@ ions showed a lower complete cure rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ul@@ atory properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with care in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies show no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although no quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) were obtained , neither after a one @-@ time nor after repeated topical application , no recommendation can be given to the application during the lac@@ tation period .
the most commonly reported and probably or possibly associated with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects in studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the field of treatment of cow@@ ards ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most commonly reported and probably or possibly related side effects associated with the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream application include complaints at the site with an incidence of 28.@@ 1 % .
the bas@@ ali@@ oma patients treated by 185 with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of phase III reported side @-@ effects listed below .
the most common adverse event , probably or possibly with the application of the i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related adverse effect , were in these studies a reaction at the place of application ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the adverse events indicated by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis are listed below .
the evaluation of clinical signs indicated according to the study plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , it is common to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ ation / sk@@ ew@@ ing / sc@@ rap@@ ing ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the evaluation of clinical signs indicated according to the study plan shows that in these studies , with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , it was very common in these studies with severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and to severe de@@ formation and cr@@ ushing ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials investigating the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was determined with an incidence of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the accidental oral reception of 200 mg is@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vomiting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluids .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination , systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were found following the topical application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the cow@@ ards in an i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment is significantly superior over 16 weeks of placebo treatment .
in 60 % of all patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , patients treated the patients completely ; this was the case with 20 % of the patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved in 23 % of 15@@ 7 patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od over 5 times a week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tumours were hist@@ ologically confirmed primary , super @-@ artificial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all patients treated were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s efficacy in one or two weeks of treatment in one or two weeks of treatment , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free time period , was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non hyper@@ kerat@@ otic , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic acne les@@ ions within a coherent 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or face .
the one @-@ year data from two combined monitoring studies show a recur@@ rent rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical radiation after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications external genital war@@ ts , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis and super @-@ cell carcin@@ oma typically do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials involving children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ mod n = 5@@ 76 , Plac@@ ebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the doses studied there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) .
minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed in the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were observed between 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable bags ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the resor@@ ption of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after topical application on MC @-@ ill skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or super @-@ artificial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ leen weight ; a study conducted for the der@@ mal application for four months revealed no similar effects .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice with mal administration of three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumors at the point of use .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small , systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , a risk is considered to be very low because of the systemic exposure .
tumors appeared in the group of mice treated with the active @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .
it may harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you . − When any of the listed adverse events affect you significantly or you notice any side effects not indicated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
● F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts ( Con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) , which have formed on the skin in the area of gen@@ itali@@ a ( sexual organs ) and anus ( anus ) ? surface bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma This is a frequently encountered , slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spreading to other parts of the body .
if it remains untreated , it can lead to clari@@ fications , especially in the face - therefore an early detection and treatment is important .
ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses are rough areas of the skin that occur in people who were exposed to sunlight during their previous life .
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be used for flat ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ atitis in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most appropriate treatment for you .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream supports your body &apos;s own immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body combat the superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or the virus responsible for infection with infection .
O If you have used Al@@ dar@@ a cream or other similar preparations earlier , please inform your doctor about this before you have problems with your immune system . o Use Al@@ dar@@ a cream until the area to be treated is cured after a previous drug or surgical treatment .
don &apos;t use more cream when your doctor has prescribed you . o W@@ ash the treated spot after applying Al@@ dar@@ a cream not with a dressing or band@@ age . o If reactions occur on the treated spot , which cause you severe in@@ convenience , wash the cream with a mild soap and water .
once the reactions are cl@@ oned , you can continue the treatment . you will inform your doctor if they do not have a normal blood image .
if this daily cleansing is not carried out under the fores@@ kin , swelling , th@@ inning of the skin or difficulties when trac@@ ing the fores@@ kin can be expected .
do not apply Al@@ dar@@ a cream in the ureth@@ ra ( ureth@@ ra ) , in the vagina ( vagina ) , the cervi@@ x ( cervi@@ x ) or within the anus ( anus ) .
taking other medicines should have serious problems with your immune system , you should use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle .
if you have intercourse with genital war@@ ts in the genital area , the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream after sexual intercourse ( not earlier ) is to be performed .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines or have recently applied , even if they are not prescription drugs .
do not breast@@ feed your baby during treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a Cream , as it is not known whether I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine passes into breast milk .
the frequency and duration of treatment are different at ti@@ lt , bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma and ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis ( see specific instructions for each application ) .
apply a thin layer of Al@@ dar@@ a cream to the clean , dry skin with the war@@ ts and rub the cream on the skin carefully until the cream is fully absorbed .
men with cow@@ ards under the fores@@ kin must pull the fores@@ kin back every day and wash the skin area underneath ( see section 2 &quot; What do you need to consider before using Al@@ dar@@ a Cream ? &quot; ) .
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .
6 weeks each week a sufficient amount of Al@@ dar@@ a cream can be applied to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area .
very common side effects ( expected in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) Frequ@@ ent side effects ( in less than 1 out of 100 patients ) Grade @-@ related side effects ( in less than 1 of 1,000 patients to be expected ) Very rare side effects ( in less than 1 of 10,000 patients to be expected )
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you do not feel comfortable while using Al@@ dar@@ a Cream .
if your skin responds too strongly to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not use the cream further , wash the affected area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
a reduced number of blood cells can make you more suscep@@ tible to infections ; it can cause you to get a blue spot faster or cause di@@ zz@@ iness .
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed adverse events affect you significantly or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
in addition , you may feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas you have applied Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of patients ) .
usually these are lighter skin reactions , which end in about 2 weeks after sett@@ ling the treatment .
occasionally some patients notice changes in the application location ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , shame , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue .
occasionally , some patients suffer from changes in the application location ( bleeding , inflammation , wound secre@@ tion , ul@@ cer@@ ation , feel or discomfort ) , inflammation of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , c@@ logged nose , flu , acute ker@@ ato@@ sis , redness , facial swelling , ul@@ cers , aching limbs , fever , weakness or ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and therefore accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints that complic@@ ate movements , decreased lung capacity , heart and eye diseases .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be supervised by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other heredi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be administered in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ alizing devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study was primarily examined for the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness was also measured ( by reducing its impact on reducing G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over 5 years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat , fever , and reactions to the in@@ fusion station .
very frequent side effects in patients under the age of five are elevated blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measure of lung function ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be severely over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will examine all new information that may be disclosed each year and , where necessary , update the summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in terms of reactions to in@@ fusion and development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me across the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other heredi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient toler@@ ates this , will be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which recovery facilities for emergency medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
as a result of the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients with Ig@@ G @-@ antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase usually form within 3 months from the start of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience in the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , due to the theoretically increased risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment , caution must be done carefully .
treat 60 minutes prior to the onset of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) in order to minimize the potential incidence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in the event of mild or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate at which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are dropped , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
the in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate at which the reaction occurred .
3 are ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate at which the previous response occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy that include embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there is no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms .
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related responses , observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients enrolled in the study with participants less than 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms observed during the phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years are reported in the following table : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre @-@ history , severe reactions followed , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory failure and visual ede@@ ma ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children un@@ desirable drug interactions associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged 5 years , with mainly severe exp@@ ir@@ ation and treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table .

most patients had a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within 3 months after the onset of the treatment , with a severe follow @-@ up in patients aged under 5 years ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older ) .
until the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to early ex@@ cre@@ tion from the study ) no investig@@ ational antibodies ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say were detected in 13 / 45 patients , including 3 patients with whom it had never been released .
patients with low @-@ low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG level in urine , whereas in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was determined .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro , which did not affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions , even if adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the ration@@ ale for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ ats and the prevention of further accumulation is sufficient recovery of enz@@ ym@@ atic activity .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about man@@ go @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study that showed the entire spectrum of disease , the majority of patients were of the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms each week for another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed improvement in lung function and ability to perform in the following table .
the open extension study showed improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as follows from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically significant over this period and the absolute lung volume increases further propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
of 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly prior treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first four weeks a clear decrease of the G@@ AG @-@ Mir@@ ror was found in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of the hetero@@ genous manifestation of the disease between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined repository , the clin@@ ically significant change across five levels of efficacy was generally observed in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a worsen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with severe exp@@ ir@@ ation form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased G@@ ag@@ - M@@ irr@@ ors in Har@@ n in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined by the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group The younger patients with severe exp@@ ir@@ ation ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed normal mental development speed , whereas in older patients with severe exp@@ ir@@ ation only limited or no progress in cognitive development was observed .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing regi@@ mens were performed on the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in the urine , the liver capacity and the 6 @-@ minute hearing test .
100 E / kg IV once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg IV once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg IV every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a justi@@ fiable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 was similar to those affected by older and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional research on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in a unique gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated application and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot be identified by any particular danger to humans .
since no toler@@ ability studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other drugs , except those listed below 6 . 6 .

within the given time , the owner of the marketing authorization has completed the following study programme , whose results provide the basis for the annual assessment report on the benefit @-@ risk ratio .
this register will provide long @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase which breaks down certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , either in small amounts or this enzyme is missing completely .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the constitu@@ ents of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have an allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
if you use al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you are taking pharmaceuticals that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of a dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken , including non @-@ prescription pharmaceuticals .
instructions for handling - th@@ inning and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted before application and is intended for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for physicians or medical staff ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient toler@@ ates this , will gradually increase to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre @-@ history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing pattern and facial oils .
very common ( occurrence of more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • headache • nausea • abdominal pain • Joint disorders , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • Re@@ duc@@ ed • fever • increased pulse • Hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion station
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available every year , and if necessary , the package insert will be updated .
if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it should not be stored for more than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C if the di@@ lution was controlled under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( cancer for cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not previously been treated in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received chemotherapy as a single treatment .
to reduce side effects , patients should take cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ em@@ etic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( medicine against vomiting ) and liquids ( to prevent a lack of fluids ) should be given before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients whose blood image changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be delayed , dis@@ continued or the dose is reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed s@@ lows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents cells from dividing .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is more readily available in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells .
in a main study , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined for the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma in 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study involving 5@@ 71 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) .
in addition , A@@ lim@@ ta was compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another anti @-@ cancer medicine ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study involving 1,@@ 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin alone .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.@@ 3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients in which the cancer did not attack the cell epitheli@@ al cells in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ata showed longer survival times than with the comparative medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta across the European Union .
each carrying bottle must be dissolved with a 0.@@ 9 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a resolution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary doses is taken from the flow bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma except for the majority of plat@@ e@@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of second @-@ line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma , except in the case of vast plat@@ e@@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface area ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cancer following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid will be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed administration and the day after treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also have to receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first mixed dose and after each third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a complete blood flow should be created before each application , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a plat@@ el@@ et count .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
a dose check must take place at the beginning of a new treatment cycle taking into account the Na@@ di@@ rs of the blood sample or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the preceding therapeutic cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria reflect the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degrees 2 bleeding .
should patients not develop non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ Grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment
the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ t@@ ines or , on the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical trials showed no evidence that in patients aged 65 years old or over 65 years of age , there is an increased risk of side effects .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 because of insufficient data on harm@@ lessness and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dose modifications were necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose modifications recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was insufficient , so the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold upper bili@@ ru@@ bin limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not studied specifically in the studies .
patients must be followed with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must not be administered to patients before their absolute number of neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ately has again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number has again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of the absolute number of neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ as , thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te numbers and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in previous cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in degrees of 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was observed when pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 occurred .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be instructed to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measures to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous sei@@ zure of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with mixed drugs ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients , for which a therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is provided , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with mixed fixed mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients with whom these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hypertension , or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant accumulation of fluids in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ usion before the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment should be considered .
5 primary cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials involving p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally when this drug was usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible fo@@ aming of the reproductive capacity is due to p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised prior to the treatment @-@ tin to obtain advice regarding the sperm conservation .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can result in reduced mixed elimination with the consequence of increased occurrence of side effects .
it is therefore advisable to apply high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be avoided in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since no data is available with regard to the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ agulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - and an@@ timet@@ aboli@@ tes , severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy .
mixed seeds may not be applied during pregnancy except if necessary and after careful balancing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to the reproductive capacity is due to p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised prior to the start of treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of the sperm .
it is not known whether p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is transferred into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the sever@@ ity and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma and the random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , as well as 16@@ 3 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma who were random@@ ized to receive C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity level 3 and 4 was similar to the three individual P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed @-@ mono@@ therap@@ i@@ estu@@ dies ( n = 16@@ 4 ) of phase 2 , except for neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared with 5.3 % ) and an increase in al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to lead to differences in the patient population as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal starting values of liver function tests .

A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate which performs its effect by interrup@@ ting important fol@@ ate @-@ dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies show that p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed works as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with multiple attacks by blocking the thy@@ me dy@@ late syn@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ d@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes in the de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ ine and pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , single @-@ blind phase 3 study by A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin against c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma demonstrated that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically significant advantage of a medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ month extended survival compared to those patients who were only handled by c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the investig@@ ational medicine in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the all@@ ot@@ tom@@ et@@ tin @-@ arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms were improved by improving lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and worsen@@ ing lung function over time in the control arm .
a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , open Phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA versus doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after prior chemotherapy demonstrated medi@@ an survival of 8.@@ 3 months with patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( intent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival was determined in favor of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non @-@ dis@@ kl@@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.@@ 00 , p = 0.0@@ 47 ) , adjusted HR = 1,@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a separately random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 5@@ 40 ) pre@@ treatment are similar to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analysis of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination opposite the gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
mean PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.1 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.@@ 15 ) , the overall response rate was 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1.4 ) for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the influence of NSCLC &apos;s hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences in the hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = Con@@ fi@@ dence interval ; IT@@ T = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) significantly below the non @-@ standard limit of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .

the resulting solution is clear and the colouring varies from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish without compromising the quality of the product .
it is applied to overweight adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ calorie , low @-@ fat diet .
patients who take All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can not break down some of the fats in the diet , causing about a quarter of fats that are added to the diet un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed in the intest@@ ines .
in a third study All@@ i compared 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 compared to placebo .
in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who received All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no significant weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on after , fl@@ ate ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ d@@ iness , stu@@ h@@ ld@@ iness , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , outlet o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( F@@ ä@@ zes ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it may not be applied to patients who are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be applied in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( where insufficient nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or ch@@ ol@@ est@@ asis ( liver disease ) , and pregnant women and breast@@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted the Company G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited a permit for placing or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K across the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ isches , low @-@ fat diet .
all@@ i may not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety .
since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally resor@@ bed , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for elderly and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.6 ) • C@@ utting time ( see Section 4.6 ) • Con@@ st@@ ent treatment with War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the likel@@ ihood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich meal or a low @-@ fat diet .
as weight reduction in diabetes may be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dose of anti@@ diabe@@ tic medication should be adjusted if necessary .
patients taking all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional fluctu@@ ating measures in order to prevent possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in the event of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on interactions of drugs and in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a reduction of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( internationally controlled ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentration of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta carot@@ ene in the normal range remained normal .
however , patients should be advised to take a supplement of mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see Section 4.4 ) .
after the application of a disposable dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time , a slight decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration .
animal experiments showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , and very rarely ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
the incidence of adverse events detected after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known , as these events have been reported voluntarily by a population of a certain size .
† It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and overweight subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after the market launch , either side effects or similar adverse events were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on investigations on humans and animals , a rapid reg@@ ression of any systemic effects that can be attributed to the non@@ inhibit@@ ing properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect sets in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pi@@ es .
from clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ isches , low @-@ fat diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to bas@@ eline ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of studies ( Table 1 ) and as part of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although weight loss was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in the Gesamt@@ ch@@ ol@@ esterin with or@@ list@@ at was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol with or@@ list@@ at was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at the waist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( initial value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .
in a study involving obes@@ e patients who administered the minimal systemic @-@ resor@@ bed dose , two main metaboli@@ tes , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after split@@ ting the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l @-@ Leu@@ cine group ) , could be identified , representing approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot be identified as a hazard to humans .

the most common side effects are associated with the mode of action of the capsules and result in increased fat ex@@ cre@@ ted from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment , since at this time you might not have consistently reduced fat in your diet .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the diet @-@ related side effects : start already a few days , or better a week before the first intake of the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • L@@ earn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood of losing your fat limit decreases . • Divi@@ de your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you may consume each meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a substantial dessert , as you might have done in other programs for weight loss .

Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies that are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting ( such as C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as for chem@@ o@@ therapies which are moderate vomiting for nausea and vomiting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
the use in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended , as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the active substance inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate vomiting for nausea and vomiting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting , 59 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are moderate nausea and vomiting , 81 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted regulatory approval to the company Helsin@@ n Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd .
al@@ ma@@ xi is indicated : to prevent acute nausea and vomiting with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a cancer illness and to prevent nausea and vomiting with moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi in preventing nausea and vomiting that is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be ampli@@ fied by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given before chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on massage , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ cally ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advised with simultaneous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ t interval is extended or which tend to such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is not to be used for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five studied chemotherapy drugs ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) .
a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a steady @-@ st@@ ate@@ - concentration oral met@@ o@@ clo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( dex@@ am@@ o@@ dar@@ one , c@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ zin , c@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ran@@ iti@@ dine , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tral@@ ine and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron Clear@@ ance .
experience on the use of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not present , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician .
in clinical trials , the most common adverse events were observed at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least were related to Alo@@ xi , headache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the delivery site ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dosage similar frequencies appeared of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effect relationships observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , but because of the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective treatment with an alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , 1,@@ 132 patients receiving a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and 250 m@@ g. of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life of 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given that were given intraven@@ ously on Day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin and 250 or 750 m@@ c@@ g. of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of the study with commonly used chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are combined in the following tables .
in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vomiting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron were comparable .
according to clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of the stock@@ holders potential .
the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy subjects was the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of intraven@@ ous pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
resor@@ ption After IV administration follows an initial decrease of plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally measured in the entire dose range of 0,@@ 3,@@ 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportion@@ ately .
after intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in the plasma concentration of 11 testi@@ cular cancer patients was 42 ± 34 % .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations indicate that the total composition ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) reached at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable with the following one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after one @-@ time intake of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately another 50 % are converted into two primary metaboli@@ tes compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies on metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser extent , are involved in the is@@ o@@ enzyme C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 on the metabolism of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered drug made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous bol@@ us injection in healthy patients the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal exclusion period and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increased , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after expos@@ ures , which are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 Out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies there are indications that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to approximately 30 times the therapeutic exposure in humans ) that were given daily over two years led to increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( thy@@ roid , pit@@ u@@ it@@ ary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al glands ) and skin tumors in rats but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for unique use , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans .

in June 2006 , the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report , in which the approval of the marketing of the drug prescribed for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological medicinal product called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medic@@ in@@ ally effective ingredient that is already approved in the EU .
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver illness caused by viral infection ) .
a microsc@@ opic examination shows the liver tissue damage , and the values of the liver enzyme al@@ anine amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are elevated in the blood abnormal .
it is produced by a yeast , into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimulates the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon showed data that show the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study on patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to 4@@ 55 patients with the efficacy of the reference medical device .
the study measured how many patients responded to the medicine after 12 of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after treatment ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int
furthermore , concerns have been vo@@ iced that data on the stability of the active substance and the drug to be marketed is not sufficient .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
following the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease worsen@@ ed again in more patients than with the reference drug . Al@@ ph@@ eon also had more side effects .
in addition to this , the test used in the study investig@@ ates the question of how far the medicine has an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , is not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be used for the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cru@@ sts ) and small infected la@@ the ( crack or cut @-@ off ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that were prov@@ able or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ tough Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not work against this kind of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 the area to be treated must not be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bit the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was det@@ ectable at the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under placebo discussed the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin findings , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together with skin @-@ dogs , approximately 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections that were prov@@ able or probably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most frequent side effect associated with al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irritation at the order .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go over short @-@ term treatment out@@ weigh the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ fir@@ ings , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted the Company G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd a licence for the placing of al@@ tar@@ go across the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the event of a sensi@@ tization or serious local irritation through the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment is interrupted , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped off and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection is started .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as the patho@@ gen or is suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs after a 2 to 3 day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical application on the sc@@ ented skin or infected surface wounds .
3 After the simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 m@@ g. of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the mean re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin E@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be increased by 81 % on the skin of healthy adult men .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations are not considered necessary if topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic .
in deciding if breast@@ feeding continues / ends or the therapy should be continued with Al@@ tar@@ go , between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the baby and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for woman should be weighed .
in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections that have applied al@@ tar@@ go , the most common reported side effect was irritation at the date of delivery involving approximately 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance produced by fermentation from c@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mode of action of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective blocking of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the second sub @-@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data suggest that the binding site of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P binding site and the pe@@ p@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase center .
binding to this binding site inhi@@ bits pe@@ p@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transmission , block partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin appears to be question@@ able in at least some infection forms , consultation by experts should be sought .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin over S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , irrespective of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ response to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
resor@@ ption In a healthy adult study , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was performed daily with oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and rested skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling procedure took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic shot on humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) was 6@@ 60 times lower than the re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ s was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between one and fifteen years who are not immune to these two diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix is used as part of one of two doses of existing vacc@@ ination plans , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix should only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immun@@ isation and it is ensured that the existing vacc@@ ination plan can be completed from two doses .
if a re@@ fres@@ her dose for hepatitis A or B is desirable , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vacc@@ ines act by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teach &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) as it can fight against a disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the vaccine approved since 1996 , and the vaccine approved since 1997 Twin@@ rix children .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix are given children within the framework of a vacc@@ ination programme consisting of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence of the use of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed protective antibody concentrations a month after the last injection .
in an additional study involving 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to six months and a 12 month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix led a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations in hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to six and a 12 @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in over 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , fatigue and irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other constitu@@ ents or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals . a permit for the placing of Ambi@@ rix in the whole
the standardis@@ ation plan for pri@@ ming with Ambi@@ rix is made up of two vacc@@ ines , the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a boo@@ ster for hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B is desired , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) antibody values are in the same magnitude as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully ensured if immuno@@ competent persons , who have responded to a hepatitis C vaccine , need a boo@@ ster formation as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory even in non @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine .
if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardis@@ ation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended , containing 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , under certain circumstances , there is no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s @-@ antibody value , so that additional doses of vacc@@ ines may be required in these cases .
since intra@@ ocular injection or intra@@ muscular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal vacc@@ ination rate in the but@@ to@@ cks , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
however , in cases of thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disturbances , however , Ambi@@ rix may be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously , as it can result in bleeding in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration .
when Ambi@@ rix was given in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it is necessary to assume that no sufficient immune response is achieved .
in a clinical study carried out with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ation , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache , and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in previous Thi@@ omer@@ ically and preserv@@ ative @-@ based vaccine Formul@@ ation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 doses of Ambi@@ rix were given to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to and including 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 , Ambi@@ rix &apos;s tolerance was compared to that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and consistency on a calculation basis per cap@@ ita of Ambi@@ rix , but not based on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the injection of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects according to the dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
after the complete ino@@ cul@@ ation cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ rix had pain , compared 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % for the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ur@@ ity was comparable to pro@@ band ( i.e. throughout the entire vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix compared with 3@@ 6.2 % of the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of severe pain and mat@@ ur@@ ality was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vaccine protocol .
in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ent Group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not pro @-@ band , was reported .
the proportion of vaccine that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine with the combined vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted at ages 1 to and including 15 years , ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose , for month 6 month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
serum @-@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose , for month 6 month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study carried out in 12@@ - to and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combin@@ ant vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was outstanding , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the injection of the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune responses reported in a clinical comparative study of 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full ino@@ cul@@ ation series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
both studies received either a 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for persons who were aged between 12 and 15 years of age , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune response observed in this study was comparable to those found in 3 doses with a combined vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s @-@ antibodies is comparable 24 months after immun@@ ization in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 month vacc@@ ination scheme .
when the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year was given at the same time with the boo@@ ster of a combined ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study carried out with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective and ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions as for the previous formulation .
the vaccine is examined both before and after res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing on any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other means , such as bathing in waters contaminated by eff@@ lu@@ ents .
you may feel very tired , have a dark urine , pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete ino@@ cul@@ ation series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child are already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus before administ@@ ering both vaccine doses ( though you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of the vaccine ) , a vaccine may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those after hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can be expressed by it@@ ching skin r@@ ashes , breathing difficulties or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B , if you / your child has a severe infection with fever / has .
• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usually scheduled dose of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and the second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he / her child will recommend three inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccine ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before ending the vaccine series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix will be inj@@ ected into the skin and not inj@@ ected into the muscle in persons suffering from severe blood cl@@ ots . if you / your child is weakened due to a disease or a treatment in your body &apos;s own defence / is or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the response to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take additional medicine / take ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated recently / have received or have been planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given simultaneously with Ambi@@ rix should be vacc@@ inated at separate places and as many different limbs as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix should be given at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix will not be given pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very often ( more than 1 case per 10 dil@@ uted doses ) : • pain or discomfort on the set or redness • Mat@@ iness • irrit@@ ability • headache • lack of appetite
♦ often ( up to 1 case per 10 dil@@ uted doses ) : • swelling at the injection point • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • He@@ aded • ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal discomfort
other side effects that were rarely reported for days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 untreated doses ) are :
these include loc@@ alized or extended attacks which can be it@@ ching or infl@@ ated , swelling of the eye area and face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden loss of blood pressure and loss of consciousness .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data , which have been known since the first approval of the placing on the market , the CH@@ MP believes that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix will remain positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was placed in traffic only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine are limited due to the low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ia may also be used in pre@@ history in patients aged over a month with incomplete enz@@ ym@@ atic defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ian en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) .
ammon@@ ia is administered - split by several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ y hose ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach leading tube ) .
this was not a comparative study because ammon@@ ia could not be compared with a different treatment or placebo ( a placebo medicine , i.e. without an active ingredient ) .
ammon@@ ia may also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disorders , stomach pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ammon@@ ia was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; allowed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information about this drug . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients , where a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( incomplete enz@@ ym@@ atic defect that mani@@ f@@ ests after the first month of life ) there is an indication of the use when a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy is present in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein intoler@@ ance and the daily protein intake of the patient .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early manifest deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ sk@@ abel bam@@ y@@ las@@ e .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine at a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing since there is a risk for the development of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , respectively 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure and with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
because metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat are carried through the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be applied with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results with regard to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats at high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) resulted in a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal proliferation and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a decreased number of dys@@ functional nerve end@@ ings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted into breast milk in humans , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least one un@@ desirable event ( AE ) occurred in 56 % of patients and 78 % of these unwanted events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , cur@@ b top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month @-@ old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound that con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys .
interfer@@ omet@@ rically , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore an alternative agent for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disturbances of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always infectious , and the disease itself led to death even in the treatment of per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues within the first year of life .
by hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative routes of nit@@ ro@@ genous ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and eventually sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born babies at post part@@ um ( but within the first life month ) to 80 % .
patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and who were already treated before the first appearance of a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients , there was time with many intellectual disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ in@@ scar@@ can@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients another worsen@@ ing of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney by glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metaboli@@ tes in plasma and urine were determined after injection of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled trials ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metaboli@@ tes was also studied in cancer patients following intraven@@ ous injection of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form , concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat measured 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion were detected .
in the majority of patients with urine leak@@ age or ha@@ em@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was det@@ ectable in plasma after noc@@ turn@@ al fast after noc@@ turn@@ al fasting .
three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of liver cir@@ rho@@ sis treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) were five times higher in plasma concentration on the third day than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine by the kidneys .
after the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had no carcin@@ ogenic effects in rats treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic dos@@ ages ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ules are either taken or@@ ally ( babies and children who cannot swallow tablets , or patients with dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia ) or through a gastro@@ stom@@ y or nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early manifest deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ sk@@ abel bam@@ y@@ las@@ e .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , respectively 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat oil was exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metaboli@@ te of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , les@@ ions were found in the pyrami@@ ds of the brain cor@@ tex .
a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , cur@@ b top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
interfer@@ omet@@ rically , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disturbances of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients another worsen@@ ing of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
after an oral one @-@ dose dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ular form , concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat measured 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion were detected .
during durability , the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature not above 25 ° C .
in this procedure the small measuring sco@@ op contains 0.@@ 95 g , the mean measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate amounts to 5 grams in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins .
if you are carrying out laboratory tests , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory studies .
if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if they are not prescription drugs .
during the breast@@ feeding period , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine may pass into the mother &apos;s milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , headache , taste disturbances , ob@@ struction of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory problems and worsen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , immediately contact your doctor or the emergency department of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating appropriate treatment .
if you forgot to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in the blood image ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ mbo@@ cytes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , abdominal pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , unpleasant skin smell , rash , kidney function , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed adverse events affect you significantly or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can no longer use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS in accordance with the exp@@ iry date indicated on the car@@ ton and container . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS looks and contents of the package AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval form , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if they are not prescription drugs .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS distributed evenly on the same single doses or via a ga@@ stri@@ c ( tube , which runs directly into the stomach through the abdominal wall ) or a nas@@ al probe ( tube caused by the nose to the stomach ) .
• Take from the container a he@@ aped measuring sco@@ op of gran@@ ulate . • Stret@@ ch a straight edge , e.g. a knife @-@ back over the upper edge of the knife to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • The amount remaining in the measuring spoon corresponds to a measuring spoon .
angi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute coron@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in case of unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; up@@ lift &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measured value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a PCI , a higher dose is administered and in@@ fusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of angi@@ ox in all@@ ure or in combination with gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with conventional combination treatment with he@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI , patients were often st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ritu@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of AC@@ S , angi@@ ox - with or without the administration of G@@ PI - was as effective in preventing new events ( death cases , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as much as conventional treatment .
in patients undergoing a PCI , angi@@ ox was as effective as He@@ par@@ in in relation to all indicators , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than He@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , other Hir@@ ud@@ ine or any of the other components .
it may not be applied to patients who had a bleeding recently , and people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart attack .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd a licence for the transfer of angi@@ ox across the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ up@@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or early intervention .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous dose of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is performed in a further sequence , an additional pin of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure a rejection of 0,5 mg / kg should be administered followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous return of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a immediately subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us gift of angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should take place .
in order to reduce the incidence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before use and the bolt dose is administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value amounts to more than 225 seconds , further surveillance is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din vs. AC@@ S or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value lies under 225 seconds , a second dose dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose to check again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , included in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after application of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also with di@@ aly@@ sis patients angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ question@@ able he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• More well @-@ known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other component or against hi@@ ud@@ ine • active bleeding or an increased risk of bleeding due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis system and / or irre@@ versi@@ bly bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and with di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is given in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even though PCI patients perform most of the ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge of arter@@ ial punc@@ tures under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , patients with a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ ona intervention ( PCI ) may undergo bleeding during the treatment .
in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and being treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after setting the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din again reaches the level before treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mode of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) , it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din with thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te units or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological ha@@ em@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are regularly monitored .
animal experimental studies are inadequate with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see under section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the bi@@ valent group as well as in the comparable groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding , as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both mild and severe bleeding performed significantly less frequently under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din than in the groups with he@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ ochem@@ ini@@ dine plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ arter@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the point area , which required radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in cone of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
other , less frequently observed bleeding loc@@ al@@ is@@ ations , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; punc@@ turing points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck .
the following information on side effects is based on the data of a clinical trial with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ valence group as well as in the comparable groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects not listed above have been reported in practice after extensive application and are group@@ ed according to system organ@@ grades in Table 6 .
in case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with a bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is to be stopped immediately and the patient closely monitor with regard to signs of bleeding .
angi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds to the cataly@@ tic centre as well as on the ani@@ onic nerve tissue region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , irrespective of whether thro@@ mb@@ ine is bound in the liquid phase or in cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and therefore its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in on its part re@@ stores the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , it was possible to indu@@ ce thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) in the past .
in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect which is occupied by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI has been performed in the patients , an additional bolt of 0,@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery will be increased to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ question@@ able He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ up@@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or before the onset of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or on the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high risk patients required by angi@@ ography within 72 hours were spread evenly across the 3 treatment arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had a recurring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography in 72 hours .

clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ ona intervention ( PCI ) and in patients with AC@@ S .
it is expected that Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is going through a cat@@ aboli@@ sm in its amino acid components with subsequent re@@ valuation of the amino acids in the body pool .
the primary metabolism resulting from the split@@ ting of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence through Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is not effective because of the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children aged six years with diabetes who need treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin for regulating the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or unable to process insulin .
insulin lu@@ gli@@ sin differs very slightly from the human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter active duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , in which the body cannot work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study involving type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was determined after six months compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % for insulin .
in adults with type 2 diabetes the lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % with human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin lu@@ c@@ sin or any of the other components , or in patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a licence for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the abdominal area , th@@ ig@@ h or del@@ to@@ id muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the abdominal area .
due to reduced glucose @-@ ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin demand in patients with reduced liver function can be reduced .
any change of the active force , the brand ( Her@@ - adju@@ v@@ ant ) , the type of insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of production , can change the insulin demand .
3 inadequate dosing or abor@@ tion of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ dependent diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
switching a patient to another type of insulin or insulin from another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage .
the time when hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia occurs depends on the effectiveness of the insulin used and can therefore change when the treatment plan is changed .
among the substances that increase blood sugar dropping and increase the tendency towards hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , the effect of sten@@ oly@@ tics such as beta block@@ ers , c@@ lon@@ i@@ din , gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ amin and reser@@ pine can be allevi@@ ated or missing the symptoms of adren@@ aline expression regulation .
animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ fu@@ li@@ sin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth , or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin delivery occurs in human breast milk , but in general insulin does not occur in breast milk nor is it resor@@ bed to oral use .
the following are listed in clinical trials , group@@ ed according to system organ@@ grades and ordered according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
cold sweat , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , concentration problems , di@@ zz@@ iness , excessive dog , changes in vision , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy If neglected to continuously change the injection area within the injection area , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy may occur at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by an appropriately trained person , or by intraven@@ ous inj@@ ections of glucose by a doctor .
after a glu@@ co@@ on injection , the patient should be supervised in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption ( especially due to skel@@ etal muscle and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin @-@ lu@@ c@@ sin the effect occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with cou@@ - man@@ t normal insulin .
in a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus , insulin delivery in therapeu@@ tically relevant met@@ ering range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a dose of proportional glu@@ cos@@ ity , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in glucose @-@ causing effect , just like human insulin .
insulin lu@@ gli@@ sin has twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the full glucose @-@ giving effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
the data showed that a similar post @-@ den@@ ounced gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control was achieved in an application of insulin lu@@ c@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal , like with a human body insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
insulin lu@@ c@@ sin was t@@ anned 2 minutes before the meal , a better postoperative control was achieved than with the human body insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
when the insulin lu@@ c@@ sin is turned 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , such as the human body insulin , which is given 2 Mi@@ - nu@@ ds prior to the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) .
insulin delivery in doses 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the beginning of the meal compared to the human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the beginning of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) and compared to the human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) prior to a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
insulin delivery in 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal compared to the human Nor@@ - mal@@ od@@ ine , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
