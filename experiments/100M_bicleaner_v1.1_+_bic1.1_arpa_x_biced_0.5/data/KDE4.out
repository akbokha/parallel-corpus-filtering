the package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite their small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them more readily available .
more information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings Enh@@ ancements ... Open the box card tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of default setting modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons package . please note that if you have additional software installed , there may be more modules installed on your system .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click on Tools Dis@@ charge . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes when present .
the module An@@ ger filter ( also called folder filtering ) is available in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras address filters . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; the current working directory in different ways .
to use DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Tools DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , example : document@@ arian element , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; is to represent ne@@ sted hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . tree @-@ Maps permit the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is proportional to its size .
with &amp; FS@@ View ; the size is the size of a file or folder , with the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can easily be detected even if it is far down in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View may be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap display is a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rect@@ angles have meaningful colour and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can either be depth for the easy recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or the mapping of another file feature such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the various properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each property , you can specify if it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angles is to be used ( and therefore display errors due to restrictions in the character of the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) .
with representation algorithms for tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . for the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this goal is not always observed . the frame is drawn to indicate the ne@@ sting of the entries , and this frame requires space , which is no longer available to the subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame , if the rect@@ angle is square .
like split@@ ting the surface of an entry for the subordin@@ ated entries , the implementation remains up to the implementation . it is always advantageous for the lab@@ eling and avoid@@ ance of space losses by means of always advantageous surfaces that rect@@ angles are formed that are as square as possible . the best methods in this respect are lines , columns or recur@@ sive division .
you can specify the minimum shown area for an entry on the menu entry View on surface . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the surface of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a lower entry .
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to use the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get , which was developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
the module picture gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras Photo Gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
when you visit the gallery , a dialog box opens , with which you can define the image of the gallery .
the title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text box .
the images per line option has a slider and a rotating panel to adjust the number of thumb@@ nails in each line in the gallery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the check box &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; File Name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see if the file names are displayed in the images in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the check box &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; File size &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see if the file size is displayed in the images in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the image size check box , you &apos;ll find out if the size of the images is displayed in the images in the gallery .
in the dialog folder you specify where the gallery is saved and which sub@@ folders are to be included .
in the file choos@@ er Save in HTML format , specify where to save the HTML page .
to include sub@@ folders with the check box , you can set the sub @-@ folder to which level the sub @-@ folders are included .
with the check box origin@@ als , you &apos;ll find out if the original images are to be copied to the gallery .
with the comment box check box , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
in the check box O@@ wn color depth , you can set a different color depth for the mini thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ settings can be found in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Tools HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
the media playback for the navigation area can be found in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; view menu under windows navigation area or with the short@@ cut F@@ 9 .
to play , click on the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or navigation area ; and drag the music files you want to listen to the media playback .
change browser detection adds a menu item in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , which allows you to change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains . this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers .
the default browser detection of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser , change browser detection in one of the following options .
changes the code in M@@ SI@@ E for sites that deny access to browsers on the basis of Mozilla . for example , you need the M@@ SI@@ E browser detection to call with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .
pages that do not correspond to the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use your own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identi@@ fier of this out@@ dated browser .
with this option , the default browser detection is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing .
with the menu entry ... you can set the scope of the information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and upload your photos directly to &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ cam ; work together .
&amp; edited ; includes fast image processing with basic image processing tools . you can use it to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can easily be extended with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( Manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ kam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; on camera or lens , which can be searched .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also &amp; digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement options .
when you are in the program , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . all information required is already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam ; then we would like to encourage you to join the user mail@@ ing@@ list of &amp; digi@@ kam . you can ask questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam . in this mailing list however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
you can also visit the digi@@ kam site ; visit the homepage to find news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
the best start to take part in &amp; digi@@ kam ; to participate , is the registration in the Develop@@ er mailing list . instructions for reporting in the Develop@@ er mailing list by &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
if you want &amp; digi@@ kam ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can specify a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data ab@@ n@@ k is saved . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you would like to add . &amp; edited ; will you additionally use as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . settings digi@@ cam set up collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder , which contains images , as a base folder . &amp; edited ; considers any sub@@ folder as an album . no image will be changed while browsing the folder you will see a progress indicator like this :
&amp; edited ; dur@@ ably recur@@ sively the library path in its entirety . you can &apos;t exclude any sub@@ folders , unless it i@@ ste in hidden folders . you can do this by inser@@ ting a dot in front of the sub@@ folder &apos;s name .
if you take an existing folder with photos as base folders , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have photos as symbols . you can change that by taking any photo from the album and placing it on the folder icon .
once you &apos;ve configured the base folder , you can go to &amp; digi@@ kam ; set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My Key@@ words to manage your photos in the albums .
raw data support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , you may also handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help Roh@@ k@@ amer@@ a@@ Backup menu .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and upload your photos directly to &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ cam ; work together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . for the actual transfer to the computer the camera is often used as a disk drive . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; uses the g@@ Photo@@ 2 program for communication with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , exten@@ sible software collection for digital cameras , which supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Ima@@ ging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and are slow transfers over the serial port , this connection is now dep@@ rec@@ ated . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and carries out the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . you can find a complete list of supported cameras under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to reliably read the preview images . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; digi@@ kam ; is how easy it is to expand its functionality through modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and g@@ agile view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in almost any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is essentially simpler , &amp; digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change full@@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
drawing and dropping images works everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the tree , over the horizontal divi@@ der line or to another application window . the only limitation is that an image can &apos;t be saved in keywords , data list , or search .
- A file type selection allows you to extract the most common : J@@ PEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields currently displayed in the symbol view . so filtering on the fil@@ en@@ ame only works if it is displayed in the symbol view . which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ Settings dialog .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ ads ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos managed by &amp; edited are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ evol@@ ent or after the date when the album was first created . the date can be changed in the album &apos;s properties .
if you have set up a scanner you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select album Import images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse onto the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu , you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . you can also move or copy several photos in the same way . simply select all photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to input information about this collection . to access the album properties , right click on the album and select album properties in the pop @-@ up menu .
album Colle@@ ctions : are a method to mark your albums so you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection from you is used to sort your photos when you select After collection from the tool@@ bar or view albums Up collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the collections for collections .
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums after date sort .
the el@@ dest , average , new ester : these set the date to that of the oldest , the latest image or that of the album &apos;s average . to do this , first try to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder .
if you first open an album in &amp; edited ; open the first picture in the album as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ ads ; this should help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you must click the image with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu &amp; quot ; As a album preview quot ; select . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the input of keywords for single photos in the section My Key@@ word list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window will display the main view of your photos . when you select an album , all images in this album will be displayed in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fying glass buttons in the tool@@ bar .
if you open an album for the first time , you have to wait a little while the preview images are generated .
information about each image is displayed below the associated thumb@@ nail . what information is , you can edit them via Settings ; set up . select the albums page here and adjust the preview images to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help buttons , which appear . if you leave the mouse poin@@ ter a moment over a picture . the help displays the most important features including all keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot above in the Intro@@ duction to the main window displays such help window .
albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures in a way that suits you . image processing displays your photos and allows you to create a number of improvements to these . you can select all the features that are with &amp; digi@@ cam ; you can choose between viewing the images , slide show or editing the images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 image Edi@@ ting ... or the right @-@ click context menu of the image . edit in the edited section ; image editing you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos . with image editing , you can view your photos and change them .
it may happen that &amp; edited ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of opening . to do this , and how to customize it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing other image editing programs , there may be problems with the metadata contained in the picture . some programs do not store this data with you when you save the modified image . this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click the thumb@@ nail to preview and shoot . in the sub@@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , right click on preview and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you maintain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you want to delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam , it will be moved to &amp; k@@ de in the tr@@ ash bin . F@@ 8 Image Del@@ ete or Del Falls you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the data sheet below in the date view , so that you can only show the photos of the selected days .
tags provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . keywords are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search .
when a keyword is selected , all the photos that were marked with this keyword will be displayed .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also assemble parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords , so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for J@@ PEG . you can also use your keywords in other programs as well . furthermore , the keywords are re @-@ imported when the database is lost when &amp; edited ; the images are noted .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either on &amp; quot ; My keywords , or click on an existing keyword and then select New Key@@ word . if you click a new keyword , after clicking on an existing keyword , this keyword will be the keyword of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword , drag it to the desired position in the tree and place it there . then a menu appears , which gives you the possibility to post@@ p@@ one the keyword . a keyword can only be once in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and editing the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords .
to select another photo as an album symbol , select the image with the right mouse button and select as album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
in order to use keywords , you first have to take your photos with keywords . this can happen in two ways : once you select the photos you want with a keyword , you can drag them to the appropriate keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords ; drag and drop them . alternatively , you can also click on the thumb@@ nails of the images and select from the context menu .
you can select a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can assign a keyword to each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event in which it was made etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , it will be displayed in the main window under the thumb@@ nail preview .
you can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and remove from the men@@ ue menu . the menu only shows the keywords that were assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ depend@@ able hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a select frame can be moved beyond this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , just click the lower rect@@ angle of the selection box , which indicates the time unit . thus , all associated images are displayed in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . then it appears in the list below .
includes all the elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more .
if you click here , the filter will be deleted and all the pictures will be shown again . if the search found nothing , then the lamp is red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you get a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion . after you have saved it , it appears filtered in the list .
if you are happy with your selection , press the head OK and the search is done . the results are displayed in the View My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching again , just select the corresponding entry in the View My search list and select an option in its context menu .
when you select a search , the form appears to enter the search with the search information previously entered . if you select As Advanced Search , the dialog for Advanced Search appears to change your previous search . here you will find more rules for the search . for more information , see the Advanced search tool section .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete from the context menu .
the Advanced search gives you an advanced search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
the list of the search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ .dll . all rules are displayed by line , separated by operators . an option can be added to this list with other information about the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... , or At least ... . furthermore , you can create Search of the Type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; character@@ izes any image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop every picture to find a similar . by using a grid , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you slide a picture of somewhere over the symbol of the blank search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : free hand colour sketch : draw a quick sketch and edited ; find the matching images . also here can be set a threshold value .
this tab provides an intuitive ticket search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move with the mouse wheel or zoom or move it . move it while you press the left mouse button . push C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to pull a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . it will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ cache .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides an illuminated table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L Add to the light table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window opens . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ cam ; main windows , you can quickly open the lamp with L extras .
from the preview pane you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window and place it . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you want to synchron@@ ize preview from the tool@@ bar and zoom or move operations on one of the pictures , then they will be compared with the other picture as well . so you can compare the same area of the two pictures .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images . if you navigate pair pairs from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas for the same . use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to display it in the right @-@ hand side . this makes it easier to work through a number of similar images .
of course , the normal dele@@ tion actions also work directly from the light table as e.g. F@@ 4 file .
all image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the light table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you can see on the crossed arrows . in order to wave the visible area of the image , you need to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in preview , both pictures will show the same image area .
the zoom works just like in other views . simply use the zoom knob under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both images when you are in the preview mode .
what is a digital stock management - away from the fashion word ? digital stock management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the photos is recording , scans or digital photos stores a form of digital stock management . most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your images , find , protect , and use photos . we look at the process for digital photography the &amp; digi@@ kam ; use . we look at the download , ren@@ ame , remove , convert , group , back , evaluate , sample , archive , optimize , wait and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital stock management takes up , inde@@ xes , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ures , seeks , transforms , assem@@ bles and exports material that has a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data about data . as per your definition , metadata is data that provides information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you will need to find a certain photo without inventory administration . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , you certainly don &apos;t use &amp; digi@@ kam ; the approach to save the metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast search and secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you care about your system is the structure of information structure unlike the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide if you want to have other access to your photos , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive , etc .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have different requirements , such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , workflow , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and work files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative picture .
we also recommend that metadata can be saved in the file &apos;s settings page . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ones ? added &amp; edited ; to them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . of course , these are the most important ones .
now the real work starts , because you should assign each photo &apos;s keywords , let@@ tering and a rating . of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . they start with the rating or the ranking . this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos during the further work .
now let &apos;s talk with keywords , keywords , as you frequently call other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed pictures from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images to the right place . changing the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dra@@ gging a sub@@ tree to another .
the graphic shows how different metadata over@@ lap . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of keywords - the next section refers to let@@ tering or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you just want to let most anyone share your photos , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . you are sure to be interested in how your photos arrive .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it more closely , then start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! one starts to dream of having associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence .
for others who look at your photos , the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help him understand the motive that you have moved to understand what you understand .
it is fine if an image is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
you can set it for a selection of images at the same time . if you export your images to web galleries , then these labels will be exported to the cap@@ tion and / or the title of the web gallery system . so you don &apos;t have to tell the story a second time for publishing .
do you remember the times ahead of GPS ? when you had to find another city without a navigation system ? was it not a boring planet before Google Earth ? well , because with pictures , the train of spatial presentation is now running with speed of light .
the possibilities of using ge@@ olo@@ cation are already inn@@ um@@ erable and will be deep@@ ening in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your journeys using images with geographic information .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and design@@ ates the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . same fre@@ edoms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you which information on the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam may be stored as information :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used .
author title ( syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line ) : linked to the author . this field contains the photographer &apos;s job title . examples of this can be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for vendors ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here that you provide the picture to others .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright @-@ sections , although they do not offer protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify this , in the image . for individuals this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
topics : plate error , disk failure , electric sho@@ cks , EC@@ C , transmission errors , ageing of the storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , distribution super@@ sti@@ tions
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you even in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , there are problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece which takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable but you can reduce this risk in which you can use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors even if you have just been written . therefore , they use a control hum@@ ming mechanism to protect yourself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control hum@@ ming . despite this massive protection , they age through chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a cheap program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that seems to work wonders for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disk can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
do not forget to copy the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store them on a clean , dark dry and protected place . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
Disk@@ uss retains your statistics for yourself . your manufacturer committees include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : disk error study
electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of failure , S@@ MA@@ RT can not detect these errors . some errors detected by S@@ MA@@ RT termin@@ ate the imminent failure . these are particularly read errors and storage counter . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the total loss due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also recover data loss due to a power failure , before you have secured the files , but these losses can usually be restored without any major problems .
while most electric devices do not constitute a lot of electric sho@@ cks , it looks different for devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed Proc@@ essors . these can cause serious damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause locked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects .
the most widespread protection against sp@@ ikes is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and ear@@ ns the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug strip . however , remember that not every socket strip also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , please ensure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also make sure that it offers protection against lightning impact and thus protects the right connected devices .
since over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage prot@@ ectors that also contain a telephone line for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a wear@@ able over@@ voltage protection . a large number of these devices are especially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while over@@ voltage protection your system protects against minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in case of a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply .
besides the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide cordless energy when a power failure occurs . this gives you the possibility to save your data and to shut down the system . some models allow them to continue working until the current runs again . if you buy a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the cost of avoiding this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can mount it as a drive on &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
they are however very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data over the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a common backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ckr ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed to photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want your images to be in full resolution online . the professional version will make you more available , in case of Fli@@ ckr More .
the web solutions are very secure from the point of view of data security . transmission errors are automatically adjusted automatically thanks to the TCP protocol , and in the large companies there is a backup and a distributed memory . there@@ with they are disaster @-@ proof .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transfers are prone to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . it &apos;s rather disturbing that there should be no protection in your computer . nobody seems to have ever thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer way of data than the one in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors a year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle disk failures on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard under a license for GP@@ L . we can only hope that it will soon be available for Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English .
Oracle launched its own initiative with its built @-@ in fil@@ esystem . it is still in alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms used by the Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the loss of data on the not@@ ebook and 46 % in the work@@ station systems . in case of not@@ ebooks , the share of the@@ fts is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to lower damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no one has been sigh@@ ted for a long time .
open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Rei@@ ser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common fil@@ es@@ ystems . you can find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupted data and data loss : un@@ true , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden break is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not saved completely before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings removed from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology is developing further , there is a natural barrier to this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensor . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is worse . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ api@@ xel . even DS@@ LR cameras have a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard disk today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not blame anyone else for data loss . thus , 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . so , backup your data according to a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous such as re@@ installing your operating system , replacing plates or res@@ izing hard drives .
suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a flash will have you lucky if the drive was not connected at that moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft accidents : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , disaster prevention always means not local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or the like .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as already said above , a common reason for data loss despite securing panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a sn@@ apshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential security : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete sn@@ apshot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates several sn@@ ap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference between files that have been really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
backup important pictures directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium .
this procedure leaves you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you will have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly sn@@ apshot for at least a month and a sn@@ apshot for each month . any further di@@ lution should be done manually after you have made a complete review .
topics : metadata , IP@@ TC data stored in the image file , retain ownership , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual equipment , ... , use of the Internet .
in order for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years , that is approximately the time period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you must consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate as time passes . unfortunately , there is no other option than to for@@ wards certain vig@@ il@@ ance . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important for reading your images , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the professional expression for the ability to change a system in its size . this actually always means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability with you and the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition . in * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this section and shift it to a new record :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record was detected by the system , but do not hang it .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the disk in M@@ B@@ gt ; # works with ext@@ 3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ d@@ c # modify the size of the drive if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can be read , then you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year .
GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more .
it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can store gam@@ ma@@ - and chro@@ mati@@ city data for enhanced color assignment on hetero@@ geneous platforms . the disadvantage is that it requires relative many administrative information , but not as many as TI@@ FF and has a slow compression . we would like to recommend this format to you to store your images .
TI@@ FF was widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with loss@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages images in high quality but requires very large files . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG This Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a roy@@ alty @-@ free and open format format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG was developed based on the need to standardi@@ se camera formats . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and is committed to using metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are already making use of D@@ NG and we hope to use Canon and Nikon also at some point .
this may be one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plac@@ ement quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a label technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file itself . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; which stands for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers capture it from an original of your recording , mostly in raw format . X@@ MP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems with the link between the metadata file and the image file . however , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of mission and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include the work on an architecture and modeling , discussion and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI work@@ groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edit , you can use this as a temporary f@@ use .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for a fine @-@ layer processing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ g ; edit , then you should add the metadata again . these have been cut off from the other programs under certain circumstances .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . first export them to web galleries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to edit your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam . in the section Ad@@ ding a photo to an album , you can add a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ Database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; to use , connect it to your computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on . for more information , see the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a finished indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the application for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need to see the camera information about each entry . with the side@@ bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the metadata tab shows the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , Manufac@@ turer notification , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image processing . note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then the selection of All Download . this will load all photos from your camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . during the download , the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired ones with the standard Sel@@ ection methods from &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , you can download the button download and then select the selected one .
if your camera supports this , an option new is available . these images have not been downloaded from &amp; edited by now . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded .
if you want to download all the selected albums or download Sel@@ ected ones , a dialogue with which you can select the target album in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums is listed as normal folder . you can read the list of existing albums in the section My Albums . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam ; loads the photos from the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the photos you want , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete them all at once by using the Del@@ ete All Del@@ ete button . if you only want to delete some , you must first select them and then delete selected ones .
please note that there is no way to restore photos that you deleted from the camera . you should check carefully if the photos were downloaded successfully in &amp; edited ; you should carefully check if the photos were successfully deleted from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera file , you should do so via the camera system , as this is much faster .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos frequently not particularly meaningful names . the file names are usually re @-@ used after the photos from the camera are deleted . this can result in double file names if you upload photos from different recording sets to the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time on which the image has been taken into the file name .
in the next section , you will find options for turning and mirr@@ oring the image and for data @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this last option , a folder will automatically be created per day .
the first two relate to the author in the standard auto identity section . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you wish for a different date format than the standard format , you can use the Pre@@ fix photo % Y % H % H : % M : % S in the edit field . to do so , turn off the date &amp; time option . for further custom@@ ization , you should read the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the option camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters . or , in capital letters , if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , edited &amp; edited ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window the next time .
&amp; edited ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time of recording to perform automatic rotation during shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the page tool@@ bar section , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually turned on , and if your camera does not provide this information , it can be edited and edited ; the photo in its original orientation . if you want to disable automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the Automatic Rotation in the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was made available , you can use it to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information .
this option is normally switched off , and in this case edited and edited ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you have to switch this option . to do so , use the Advanced Button and select the option Data @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the button downloading . then select up@@ loading . the file choos@@ er dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that should be uploaded . you can also select more than one file using the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , asks &amp; edited ; you , where the images should be uploaded . a folder choos@@ er dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to carto@@ graphic an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architects and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser with a click that displays the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ kam ; users who want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ers and map references .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receivers . either as a card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading of GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you must save this data in the g@@ p@@ x format , since this is the only format supported by the geographical assignment module .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate the data from images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the lati@@ tude or lati@@ tude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the characters ha@@ iry coordinates that are created , for example , map@@ s.@@ google .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; edited ; try to give you so much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; edited . to access these settings , you need to edit settings in the Settings menu ; select Settings . the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing . you set the default behavior of &amp; edited ; note that when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardis@@ ation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface . also in case of database synchron@@ ization , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields .
author title is a syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line : this field should be the professional title of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the car field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to indicate who works the photo . this does not have to be the author , if this is for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here as this is the image of others &amp; quot ; an@@ biet@@ en@@ quot ; . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC field . this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the &amp; digi@@ kam database ; these metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported in &amp; edited , without going lost .
save image labels as embedded ann@@ ot@@ ations ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in J@@ PEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the labels embedded in the pictures . therefore , your labels can also be read by other image viewers .
the Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse cur@@ sor rests in the main window over a file . depending on the option selected , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ kam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; to view , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . each file in a &amp; edited ; album folder that will not have any of these extensions , by &amp; digi@@ kam ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset once again by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
these settings are set to the default values on this page . however , each time you open the LED , these settings are not available . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size , you should only use on fast computers . if you have one , you can get better results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can disable the tool@@ bar when using the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or bright color in the image . these colors are specified here . in image processing this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ sub@@ sampling it is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation .
with the P@@ NG compression setting , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality because P@@ NG uses a loss@@ less algorithm . the only effect is that the image data need more time to fold and un@@ pack . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression .
this option reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it has no effect on image quality since the Def@@ late algorithm works loss @-@ free .
when selecting loss @-@ free J@@ PEG 2000 files , you can save loss@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal J@@ PEG . when this paragraph is written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in the planning .
in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image processing was only an image viewer for photos . currently , it is quickly becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of image processing .
the default is that all green pixels are equal . if the green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels in odd lines , this difference creates a grid pattern in the output . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option marks the picture a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the Automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed photos get more details in the top lights in four steps . for other cameras , this option is ignored .
the default is the top @-@ lights , so the parts of your images are burned out , because of the inability of your camera to capture the pointed @-@ lights , as they display the setting @-@ through white in the settings . the setting colors trigger some unusual results as they display the pointed @-@ lights in various types of ros@@ em@@ ary .
this is possible because blue pixels in general do not satur@@ ate as fast as green and red . therefore , and d@@ cra@@ w try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question of how much color or white you want .
if you select the Rec@@ re@@ construct option , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can / should therefore be individually adapted for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . this can also be done later in the editing options of the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing . in order to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data coming from the color @-@ filtered image sensor , which has many cameras and which provides a matrix of color pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ ming Design .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provides you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks as if A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ esis Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . it creates color @-@ bar@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for colour sof@@ tening , since it is performed during the pipe conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the colour information and gives instructions how to get them back . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as colour information can be translated from a color space in the others to enable the colors to be as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when an image is opened in image processing / color management module with raw files .
color Profile Fol@@ der Set here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles .
settings of ICC profiles You have here the option &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; to deposit for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your images color does not manage the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not include color mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma does not correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself .
there are other options such as the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate as your image would be returned from one device . this is very useful before you print image since your printer can have a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore very saturated . this could be done manually instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious which colour profile for them is intended for . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . so here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . obviously , this answer is in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension lets you recognize the style for the destination : F for a precise style , L for Land@@ sc@@ apes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by deplo@@ ying this interface can &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these will be loaded by &amp; digi@@ kam . these modules appear as new entries in the main window &apos;s menu and in addition , you will find some also in the context menu of the Pre@@ views .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under settings Sh@@ ort@@ cuts .
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds are fine . the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom end of the images while the ad is displayed .
the camera features display a list of all supported cameras on the left side . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button Automatic Det@@ ection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , switched on and in picture display mode .
at the bottom you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you select a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera box . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / wave , on which you mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and switch it on .
if you don &apos;t , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main window &apos;s cameras . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; Show images in the tr@@ ash bin , you can edit the conversation between &amp; digi@@ kam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the sections del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album , you will find more details .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly adopted by &amp; digi@@ kam , if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without any questions . otherwise , you will need to save the changes with the button changes .
you can also display the display of the &amp; digi@@ cam greeting video ; at startup . this acceler@@ ates under certain circumstances the start process of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
setting Start for new photos is forcing &amp; editing the base folder to new or deleted albums / photos . this length@@ ens the start time &amp; edited ; if something was deleted from the base folder , &amp; digi@@ kam ; you , if it is to delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be edited in &amp; edited to customize the main window to suit your taste . you can select these settings under Settings design from the tool@@ bar . previ@@ ew@@ ing the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information on this in this tutorial .
&amp; edited ; includes fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve them . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image , or by the context menu of the preview and selection of an ad / editing item .
the image processing includes a set of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam . you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules , please refer to the Image Processing section .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fying factor , and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top and among them the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions .
the editing functions of image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using Save file or the Save button from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image .
so you might want to make a copy of your image before changing it . you can save it by saving file .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore menu or the button To restore image processing in the tool@@ bar . you will then lose any change you have made on the photo since the last saving .
almost every action of image processing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action can be und@@ one by selecting Un@@ do or Rest@@ ore editing by selecting Edit Res@@ ale from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should make use of the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you click the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the undo button or restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions in between will also be und@@ one or restored .
once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword , using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , image down , or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the View menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : automatically select the magni@@ fying factor
view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . normally , the tool@@ bar is displayed . if you do not want to , you can select this in the Edit &amp; Edit Settings dialog . you can view this from the editing dialog . see the section for setting up image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print image in the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print single pictures or whole phrases . whole picture pages can be printed from your selection . you just need to select the images using the standard methods and select from the menu album Export Graphi@@ cal Wiz@@ ard . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
edited &amp; edited ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge providing important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available , without the navigation arrows , also in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five tab@@ s is cli@@ cked :
multiple click on the same rider that makes the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the edge .
in the cap@@ tion view you can insert or paste in@@ scriptions with unlimited size . note the remark below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied into EX@@ IF and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after you have commented on , use either the user button or simply switch to the next image , the labels will then be saved .
there is a button next to the user button . this allows you to read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images .
the review section shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searches and sor@@ tations . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate several images simultaneously , select them and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field Ur@@ gency . the code follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used previously in this &amp; edited session .
the keyword is dynamically adapted to the given keyword . you can limit the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom is a further relief when typing keywords in a series of images . if you have entered different keywords , they are saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword keyword keyword .
if several images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword , this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection , if you want to add a sample with a keyword , please read the keyword filtering section .
the side bar Key@@ word Filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - date , random and search views . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also draw and disc@@ ard keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with cat@@ ch@@ words . if the keyword exists already , you can simply draw it from the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword filter is on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three pictures . they have been selected with C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a keyword is drawn from the right word tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog box asks if this keyword is to be set .
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be switched off under settings Differ@@ ent .
if you have a rule with and created and realize that it should be one or more , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is searched . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can set an Advanced search over all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , just use the check box at the end of the rule and then select the Group button . the options then look as follows :

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner come in a predictable devi@@ ation from the actual photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can reach that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and the colors you print or publish to those of your digital dark chamber .
when the subject comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should provide you with background information about color management . in addition , you should make links with deeper information to make your own informed choices so that you get the desired result .
if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
your only other image issues are by e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life easy for everyone , why use a different color space and have to worry about color management ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB video limitation compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms &apos;s excellent page and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to c@@ alli@@ br@@ ise my monitor if I decided to work only in s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you work in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you must c@@ alli@@ br@@ ise your monitor , since s@@ RGB converts your monitor to s@@ RGB . if you are working as s@@ RGB colour space , then you either need to c@@ alli@@ br@@ ate your monitor to s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , balance , Automatic distance and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ tive Automatic correction try to make the best out of your colors . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which is best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the light intensity values over the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest spot is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or well @-@ washed .
in the same way , almost every brightness range achieves the same number of pixels . sometimes the comparison achieves very good results in enhancing the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that causes miracles in an image or destro@@ ys it .
automatic matching : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright boundary tones and converts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram region .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the wi@@ dest possible range and a new perspective of all values in between . this is only visible with washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is slightly restricted because of a color space with 8 @-@ bits per color . if you can be too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu item colors white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image . preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original image again , click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target picture has a red marker . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the pixel on this marker is displayed as a vertical line in hist@@ ogram .
at the top right there is a hist@@ ogram that is dynamically changed once you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit pictures , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called lumin@@ ance .
the contrast of your results depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or even dim down .
to play with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . this way the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the default settings list . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will see the combined result in the white balance . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons make this exactly . any setting of the white balance that you have set can be saved in a text file and relo@@ ad later .
the Pre@@ ferences button rever@@ ts all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in another photo than your original . if you save them your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image here . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widespread J@@ PEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this encoding requires more disk space , comp@@ utation time and is only available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images . it uses the change and allocation of color profiles . color ton@@ ing can be done by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed guidance for using color profiles allows you to consult the chapter Color Management .
another important tool is to find in the menu under colors tone correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously and allows you to adjust your settings so that you can use it for several photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same error and you always need the same correction . in the manual for tone correction , you will find more information .
a very powerful way to correct exposure issues is the tool for gra@@ dation that you will find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
editing &amp; editing ; tool color effects provide four color effects , a solar power effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a can@@ ister filter .
in times of chemical processing , also known as Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect of the creation of a partially developed printing of a short flash light and then perf@@ ected the development of the image . this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely .
the intensity controls the solar system . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible .
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing .
the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and therefore a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts . the characteristics make it the film of choice for nature photographers .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images , the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras frequently have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common that you want to correct the colour contrast and the lumin@@ ous intensity of the photos . you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the O@@ k button and you will be applied .
if you can do a photo in poor light conditions you can get the reverse problem : one too great satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . all changes you can perform can be viewed in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tools gra@@ dation and simple lumin@@ ous strength / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is set to improve exposure . even if the dialog with this tool works very complicated , you will need only the area of the slider for the application described here .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . below the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into which they can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn operation is to move the knob and take care of how the image changes .
the original and preview of the image can be viewed on the right @-@ hand side . the preview is updated dynamically , using the image &apos;s settings . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : this selection box shows whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , linear representation is often the most useful . in images the large areas of a constant color are dominated by the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is more useful .
three controllers : the upper@@ most one for the dark tones , the middle for the bright sounds and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma values .
the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , middle and bright sounds . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic alignment .
exit values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls which can be used to inter@@ actively change the output values as in the input rate . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a f@@ aded image as background while something else is to be seen in the background .
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons you can save the set values in the file system and relo@@ ad later . to do this , the Gim@@ p Levels file is used .
if you use this mode and three colour pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input value is automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture ( 2 ) .
the left side displays half of the original and the target image . preview is updated dynamically depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modi@@ fier channel : this box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera , linear mode is the most useful . for images with large areas of a constant color , linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case log@@ arith@@ mic mode will help .
for example , if you post@@ p@@ one a course arrow to the right , for example the bright sounds , you can see that these bright sounds correspond to darker output tones and that the associated image pixels become darker .
a red marker is shown on the preview of the original image . if you move this marker on the area you want to change , a matching line is shown on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
when using this method and the three colour pi@@ pet@@ ting buttons , automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun shades . enable the colour pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance Channel . shadow and sun shades have been set with the colour pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam channel mixer ; image processing is a tool for improving colour channels or changing the color shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer of image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and impact . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider .
the preview of the target picture has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will display the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you enable lumin@@ ance , the image will retain the overall brightness even if you change the appropriate color components . this is particularly convenient if you also activate the option Mon@@ ochro@@ me , because the channel mixer then is THE tool to generate great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially if you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that comes from the color . far@@ med consists of small noise files that do not appear at the same spot in the color channel and their noise pattern in each channel looks different . if that &apos;s the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the color noise first .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad Buttons are used for this purpose . any mixer setting can save you for later and then load . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . preserve the L@@ umin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image is shown in ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography is always fascinating because of your ability to abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step as color images can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene pictures and fits especially well with portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves Land@@ sc@@ apes , maritime scenes and aerial photos .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate lun@@ ar scenes at the time of day . thus , similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm bright and medium tones as it adds a bit of cold into the she@@ ar tones . this is very similar to the process of le@@ aking a pressure and the re@@ development in a s@@ lay pad . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) squ@@ am@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool texture you can apply decorative textures on an image .
by adding a texture to your image , whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged d@@ ots or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper tex@@ tured effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified one ( 2 ) to be seen . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping an observer &apos;s eye in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . it is a possibility to keep his attention to the image of a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the scat@@ tering eye . under picture frame add the module from the image processing .
type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image . throughout the picture bor@@ dered with a colored line , ni@@ ep@@ ce surround it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , ed@@ ged it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame , ideal for a knock effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the range of values for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image that is decorated with the frame will be greater than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio .
with this handy tool , you can insert easily one format@@ ted text into an image at any place . this also goes to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text orientation , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its features as you need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; any setting you chose for your text can be changed until you click the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
using the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool template you can put a template about a picture .
the menu image template used in image processing can be used to place templates about a picture .
for the template there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation . however , you must use the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for the reduction of the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to &amp; digi@@ kam ; send an email in English to the editor ; mailing list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the sten@@ cils , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder appears . selecting a folder updates the preview of templates automatically .
you can preview three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this knob enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
it is cent@@ red around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
post@@ p@@ one this button to post@@ p@@ one the image lying under the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image is then adjusted automatically to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures .
blur@@ red mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually it sharp@@ ens no bit , it works rather psycho@@ visually . you can use it to remove atmospheric dun@@ st and it makes a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is copyright protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for custom@@ ization .
the same phenomenon can be observed when ink points are printed on paper . the same phenomenon can be observed when ink points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras normally require more than normal cameras for private users .
in J@@ PEG images , camera internal sharp@@ ness has often been applied . in contrast , images in raw format must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners use a sharp@@ ness filter while reading the image . if you disable this , you get the control over your image .
in some situations , you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing ke@@ yst@@ one . you can call up Cor@@ rec@@ ise Field with the menu entry .
you should do this carefully because the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but increases the sharp@@ ness . in general , the most useful technique to shar@@ pen an image can re@@ focus the tool . you can re@@ focus it using the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ise . under re@@ focus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too crisp . the solution to draw the picture a little sof@@ tly is much easier than to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sign with the menu item Cor@@ rec@@ ise sof@@ tening and experiment something with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove mu@@ cus from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and preview will help you to edit the image . the preview window will display the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tested first . an increase of the radius or the amount enhances the effect . if you make the blur@@ red mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ en@@ ades are created near sharp edges .
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , they should shar@@ pen images best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference @-@ amount . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference thus for an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from the shar@@ per and therefore avoid f@@ law in faces , skies and water surfaces .
this is an example of the blur@@ red mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted de@@ ple@@ tion filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Viennese Fil@@ tr@@ ation . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blu@@ r mask . re@@ focusing usually achieves better results as blur@@ red . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing the colors in the image processing .
the Gau@@ ß &apos;s fold has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ ies , which are far from the original source pixel . the FI@@ R Viennese in@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding is influenced in most cases even very strongly from the distant pixels . it causes un@@ desirable results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular wiring . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most pictures , the default value should yield 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in the correlation may help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation may be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values are close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase of the noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the filter can accept values of 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad .
sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the palate . use this parameter if your blu@@ r is &apos; sh &apos; . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a non @-@ zero value , you might also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results , especially if you have selected large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the gauge &apos;s sharp@@ ness . note , however , that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform any cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you otherwise change the picture . the reason for this is that many operations are not immediately visible , but leave behind some unpleasant arti@@ facts .
if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as J@@ PEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the sharp mas@@ king used a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
theoretically , un@@ sharp mas@@ king must always create art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blur@@ ring . for the Vienna filter one can show that it is the optimal linear filter . practically the result of the FI@@ R Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blu@@ r mask . the FI@@ R Viennese filter is often better when processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image :
this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the methods of sharpen@@ ing correction in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoo@@ te &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulator sets the sharp@@ ness of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the colour ink allows for a modified color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , then you can set this here .
the tool error correction is one of the most widely developed tools to remove un@@ desirable art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to make the restoration easier . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab@@ s smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail preservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to uniform smoo@@ thing over the image . whereas larger values are smoo@@ thed in homo@@ geneous regions and details are sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should keep details in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing should be necessary afterwards . please note that the details should always be subordin@@ ated to the direction depen@@ dency .
direction depen@@ dency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes evenly in all directions , while a value close to 1 is smoo@@ thed in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ul@@ ator or CCD chips , a high value will cause wave @-@ like patterns . J@@ PEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 .
fl@@ atten &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all@@ es. p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repeat : speci@@ fies how often the algorithm is gone through . normally , 1 or 2 is enough .
angle @-@ step as &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is small , you should also choose small angles . make sure that small angles create a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs .
integral pac@@ ing range &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de length in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never larger than 2 .
using linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the higher quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal . however , it doubles the run@@ time . therefore , we recommend it to let it out .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons do this exactly . any adjustment of image errors can be saved in a text file and relo@@ aded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and take a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button demoli@@ tion .
below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City by an analog camera . as you can see , there is an odd black arti@@ fact in the foreground that caused by a poor film shift during the journey . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stains and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; - effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise that can be removed successfully with this tool .
here you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Pre@@ ferences window can stay with default settings .
radius monitors the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can blu@@ r the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and therefore smaller faults adjusted .
focus : controls the focus of the focus . this value sets the pixel pitch the filter to the front to detect lumin@@ ance changes . if it is increased , noise peaks are deleted . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter details will no longer be preserved and noise or s@@ mi@@ sting occurs again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , not the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak h@@ iss or J@@ PEG art@@ ef@@ acts without loos@@ ing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance intensity of the image . we recommend changing color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend changing color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically stronger , but also lubric@@ ate the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the alignment of phase j@@ itter atten@@ uation . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , edges appear smoo@@ ther when it is too high . if it is at its minimum , noise and phase j@@ itter appear on the edges . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it .
save under and load : these buttons are used exactly for that purpose . all the noise reduction parameters you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little sof@@ tly is fortunately much easier to shar@@ pen than a picture . use the tool to sign a soft sign with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ise sof@@ tening and experiment with the smoo@@ thing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this restoration provides you with the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ulation , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local mistakes that appear in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized pictures .
the algorithm for restoration has been developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
save J@@ PEG art@@ ef@@ acts : compression of J@@ PEG is not perfect , in some areas far away from it . as a loss @-@ prone compression algorithm it produces some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons make this exactly . each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and relo@@ aded later .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and take a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Be@@ ading .
below you can reduce like a photo with uniform noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film grain on the faces ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time , textures were reduced to an old photo taken with a scanner . you can see the scan @-@ art@@ ef@@ acts caused by the scanner lights and the phot@@ op@@ aper . the original image is shown in ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem particularly in high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos , as many cameras with J@@ PEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; light Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ screen sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file in the wizard with the button dark . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the preview window .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you connect the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the matching dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark picture will find the bad pixel . note that the wizard shows the last dark image and relo@@ ads this automatically in the next session .
the image area and preview will help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
average : an average of the adjacent pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are pulled up to compu@@ te a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are pulled up to compu@@ te a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of cubic bends ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; edited ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in the medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead , &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by lowering the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which makes it impossible to keep the camera by hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise adverse effects are caused by movement .
it is possible to simulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ Filter by using the large exposure range of today &apos;s film and / or gra@@ y@@ scale depth of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners . the tool vi@@ gn@@ etting correct applies the transformation with a C@@ enter@@ Filter to an image . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three controls , you can control the vi@@ gn@@ etting correct filter and with three further expos@@ ures of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2.@@ 0 , which is equivalent to an optical filter with aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random a lumin@@ ous intensity of 2 . increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting , reduce it by a small degree .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image using these options .
if you want a fin@@ er read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ escent / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu .
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ etting error applied to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a light and contrast correction was also performed in the image using this tool .
the &amp; edited ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the second degree co@@ efficient deals with the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the co@@ efficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the co@@ efficient fourth degree correc@@ ts the distant corners towards that of the second degree . if you combine these two can almost eliminate any geomet@@ rical distortion .
general : this value controls the strength of distortion 2nd degree . with negative values , barrel distortion can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distortion 4th degree . this value works more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; corners &apos; parameter has the inver@@ ted character of the parameter .
zoom : this value res@@ izes the image size and thus correc@@ ts the first degree of gravity . negative values increase while positive image size decreases .
ligh@@ ten : this value adju@@ sts brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box shows the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are stored and used as standard values at the next start .
the clay or cushion distortion should be done before all cutting or res@@ izing changes . it is best to perform this correction first . if you want to re@@ ap a picture and then perform a ton @-@ shaped correction , the effect would obviously be the wrong one .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal help line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to view the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the margin or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . subsequently , you can correct the ton@@ ne / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black verti@@ ces . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the menu Trans@@ forming cutting from image processing or using the Zoom regulator of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motifs , such as pictures from the front , frame and picture , is the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is shown in ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating infrared films of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org web site , which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the preview area . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can look at the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview , you can set two parameters for film gran@@ ulation and sensitivity to film ( ISO ) . enable the fo@@ t film gran@@ ulation option if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO knob changes the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter mixes colour channels to reproduce infrared films , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as the colour information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a type of aura in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter film grain is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool for producing film grain on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , manufacturers mix large silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift into the past . the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street @-@ photographic , gra@@ iny image especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter .
with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the movie gra@@ dation effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processed ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity is ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still lif@@ es are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large images . smoo@@ ths controls the smoo@@ th@@ ness or , viewed from the other side , the sharp@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the processing is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel large picture is 1 and smoo@@ te 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a cab@@ bage . images whose gra@@ dient are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch you . these would be good pictures to start with .
there are two controls with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob chooses the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smoo@@ th@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter en@@ grav@@ ings shape your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter engraving is a fast tool to give your images back with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure in which color is not the most important thing in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ strous landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and make it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 , the image is distorted with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the knob to exit .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blu@@ r effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Imp@@ air@@ ing : blur@@ ring the image along a star shaped line . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ om@@ atic camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often used in sports photography .
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image by turning the pixels by a center . this simul@@ ates the blu@@ r of a turning camera .
distance blu@@ r : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to step back into the background .
blur@@ red vision : blur@@ ring the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : photographed from a car or train , camera .
this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton Eff@@ ect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
shaking : blur@@ ring the image through random shifting of the pixels and thus simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent blu@@ r : finds the paint pool in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo into rectangular cells and creates it , through filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Be@@ ading .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your image . this gives it natural your pictures a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . as the drop@@ let size does not grow automatically with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fis@@ si@@ es changes the optical effect of the drops on the image .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing to hold a range free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , for example a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter ra@@ ind@@ rops , the area will remain free from ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the ra@@ ind@@ rops . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) suggests a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it in the right direction by mirr@@ oring or turning . the tools for this can be found in the Trans@@ former Tur@@ ning or Trans@@ forming menu .
photo bli@@ sters is definitely one of the most developed tools to increase a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom in an image when the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you retrieve or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select to change size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
the size change tool uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool for infl@@ ating .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to increase an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ ated was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size Ri@@ der and are listed below :
preserve aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image is retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for this purpose . each st@@ allation for photo magni@@ fication can be saved as a text file and relo@@ aded later .
infl@@ ating photo is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and take a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Be@@ ading .
you can see below an example of picture bubbles by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard enlargement to compare .
the editing of a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . to cut a photo you just need to create the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle , you will see this rect@@ angle as you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button , the area of the photo will be cut away . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by drawing at the corners of the rect@@ angle .
once you are satisfied with cutting , use the button The cutting button of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file Save and save file under the File menu to save the newly cut photo .
in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog will be retained .
according to the aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as a high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the portrait aspect , the greater value of the height and the cross @-@ format of the width is always assigned .
the tool Fol@@ ding the aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you are using centimet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . you can , for example , see a list of traditional sizes for photographic paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog , you can set the area to cut to the maximum possible , depending on the selected ratio and orientation .
when you use the edit tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on the orientation . the modified image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the combination aid make it possible to hide help so that you can put your pictures together better . these aids are :
harmonious Tri@@ angle : harmonic parti@@ tions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle in similar harmonious tri@@ angles at the diag@@ onal .
golden Center : the golden middle is a division that focuses on different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden partition is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who designed your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where each number is equal to the sum of their two preceding numbers .
the golden centre provides more liquid auxiliary lines when assembling a picture . these aids are listed below :
in comparison to the third rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition guides the gaze of the observer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow in this way .
another rule is the rect@@ angles of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angles . these rect@@ angles are used to create the golden spiral . there should be something that distra@@ cts the eye into the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . this can simply be there without guiding the eye , it will carry out its task .
the golden tri@@ angles also diver@@ t from the golden spiral discussed above . your verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rect@@ angles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not the same angled tri@@ angles . diag@@ on@@ als on these lines can be released a static object more dynamic .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise .
the Horiz@@ on@@ tal options mirror and mirror vertical mirrors to mirror the harmonic parti@@ tions .
with the Color button , you can set the color of the guides . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the relief lines can be invisible . in this way , you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
when you make a photo , it happens that you don &apos;t keep the camera vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated at an angle . you can fix this with the editing and the tool free rotation . select to transform free rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your picture with the slide angle . the values on this slide are indicated in degrees . with the pres@@ et button , you can set the slider to 0 degrees . preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the upper right .
for your help , the free rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after you move it over an important point of the image you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have turned a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair this is to use the function Trans@@ forming cutting from image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is the Automati@@ cally cro@@ pping function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the picture a bit after rotation . however , note the above warning .
all perspective transform@@ ations are performed at a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog , you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left at the top : indicates the current angle in degrees on the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle right top : indicates the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : indicates the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : indicates the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image gets a little gre@@ ased . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transforming Zu@@ be@@ xes from the image processing .
the sc@@ aling tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite . a horizontal sc@@ aling , for example , will shift the upper part of the picture to the right and the lower part to the left . this is not rotation , the image is distorted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via Trans@@ former Sc@@ iss@@ ors .
use your image by using the horizontal angle and the verti@@ cals angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target picture will be displayed on the right of the preview area .
to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the sh@@ ear@@ ing tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sc@@ aling , the picture gets blur@@ red . for a single sc@@ aling , this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two alloys are double as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sc@@ aling , the image has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transformation and cut out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , by the way these libraries are compiled . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats .
because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to provide a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find J@@ PEG and TI@@ FF below .
&amp; edited ; shows only files in formats that are familiar . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of those with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can edit the file in the editing pane . you can change this list of file extensions editing &amp; editing . see Con@@ figuration section for more information .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : J@@ PEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; edited ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression processes to digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way .
J@@ PEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than J@@ PEG with the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also store loss@@ less if specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw format , read Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English . you can convert raw format pictures in J@@ PEG or TI@@ FF to &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ kam . with this , more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all support cameras can be seen at the bottom of the Dave Coff@@ in web page .
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often saved in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; understands these formats and will generate preview for the movies . &amp; edited ; is not a film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities to display or edit movies .

K@@ IP@@ I module exports a number of images to a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed using Google Earth .
if you swap the steps 4 and 5 , which you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four adjustments with the module white balance .
many tools you need the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ kam ; their description follows here .
all image processing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , m@@ oll@@ us@@ cs , noise reduction , re@@ focus , blu@@ r mask , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialogue type that shows the effect in preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below , you can see &amp; quot ; texture quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current image . to the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertically parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizont@@ ally split@@ ting without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
divide vertically . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
divide horizont@@ ally . the upper part shows the original and the bottom to compare the effect of the filter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mouse over &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can switch on to show over@@ exposure and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the image you want to preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noticed .
the side@@ bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data originate from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive ticket search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move with the mouse wheel or zoom or move it . move it while you press the left mouse button . push C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to pull a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ let files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and to select and nam@@ ing colors .
the Pal@@ ettes files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can either be used for the entire system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ settings and hot custom colors and last used colors .
in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pallets or search the folder by files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the palette view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described below the pal@@ let view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box Bei@@ m Cur@@ sor is activated under the button Add color , the color is inserted from the color panel at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ written another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write has been selected .
a selection that was created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions Cop@@ y , Cut and Pa@@ ste .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line @-@ end sign , if another color follows . if there are three figures in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as one color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color sel@@ ector can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color sel@@ ector on the left .
&amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; is a K@@ DE program used to view &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ ene . the programs , the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; contains , according to the program author out@@ dated &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ amma viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ amma viewer ; displays graph@@ ene with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; at . it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; POS ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph in &amp; kate ; re @-@ calcul@@ ates the graph@@ ene and in &amp; k@@ screen viewer ; )
menu to open the graphs in &amp; kate ; to open or to open the graph in &amp; k@@ amma viewer ; in a &amp; kate ; Compon@@ ent
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems with about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to represent more than these k@@ not )
further required software : &amp; k@@ amma viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which requires the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs . needed are in detail :
the main window displays the opened graph , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ screen ; without launching an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list of Rec@@ ently opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; -@@ files , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview using the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( up and down without special keys , left and right at pressed &amp; old ; key ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded file is modified by another program , the following window will appear :
you can choose whether the graph is to be re@@ charged or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ amma viewer ; can also remember your decision so that later it will be done . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item settings k@@ screen ; set up ... use , see also .
if you want to open a Graph@@ end@@ at@@ ei outside an ongoing &amp; k@@ amma viewer ; instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you can choose whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ amma viewer ; instance , or display the graph@@ ene to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but it can also be changed with the setup dialog .
when you start the program , you can open all graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how the graph should be split into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
when you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page should be adapted to this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph .
page preview with a number distributed on several pages without a head@@ line and with another font
the Renew@@ able Store page gives you the ability to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( relo@@ ad or ignore changes ) or ask for the program every time .
you can specify a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or specify that each time is requested .
the session management page gives you the possibility to specify the start behaviour of &amp; k@@ amma viewer ; you can specify a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or to be asked at each start of the session .
the context menu , which normally appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n , opens up further possibilities :
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z website , are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directed graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered representations of directional graphs . the algorithm sets the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then attempts to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge cross@@ ings as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ ed graphs . it produces images according to the spring@@ board model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm generates a spring@@ loaded model for ung@@ eri@@ ed graphs . it uses the Fru@@ den@@ man Rein@@ gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and contains a multi @-@ grid trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the no@@ des in a circle in line with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for specific diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph file as parameter , and display the calculated layout of the graph according to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can give &amp; eg ; den &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ algorithms to change the graph with a filter before drawing .
determines the type of graph ( directed or executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ eri@@ ed graphs ) .

reading the K@@ IP@@ I module images provides tools to read and save images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the images scanning the menu item , a dialog appears , which lets you choose between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by replacing the default values duc@@ r@@ he &apos;s own to select your image . look at the preview and adjust the area to suit your needs before you scan the image using the scanning button . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
make sure the window will be displayed completely , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after you have pressed the scan button you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to specify the options of the target image appears . please remember that the type BM@@ P does not compressed and therefore creates very large files . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create by saving the image .
screen shots can be created after selecting import &gt; screen shot in the menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all of your program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ space . if you have selected the complete Desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work@@ tops , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate .
after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialog box appears with the options described above .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF keyword of the image and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Gali@@ le@@ o . height , length and lati@@ tude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical location Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears then . to create a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data that were taken at the same places at the same time as the images of your camera .
when the file is loaded an automatic correlation is carried out which indicates coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera side must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time@@ zone . set your camera zone here .
the setting for the maximum time vari@@ ance gives an upper vari@@ ance for the GPS time and camera side . if the devi@@ ation below is merged , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have trace data from one place for images , you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add it to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you have no matching data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog is the coordinates of one call to the next , you just need to use the button OK to place the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . select the region and increase si@@ e.@@ Run it again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be changed manually . the map can be changed between card mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
complete outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ tool to provide a pile of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool for ex@@ porting a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is en@@ coded UT@@ F @-@ 8 in order to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the panel selection allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ vor@@ schau and the text that appear in the head of the HTML page will appear .
the Ap@@ pear@@ ance tab defines general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option For each image creates a page creates a gallery in which each image will also display its own page . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , displayed
the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all your images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
if you select the J@@ PEG format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images .
with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . naturally , it also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the rider thumb@@ nail allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album Reiter for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window displays the user how far the action is . press C@@ anc@@ el to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be automatically closed . therefore , you can read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser is automatically launched at the end to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming , or shifting on them . the viewer can be used with short commands and buttons . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions .
after startup , a picture will be displayed in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I J@@ PEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool to change pictures without compromising your quality .
this module allows you to save images in J@@ PEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases , since no compression of the colour information takes place . for example , this is also found in the P@@ NG file format .
the K@@ IP@@ I digital camera client is a tool for you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the import function . this then opens the file choos@@ er dialog with which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any target format . J@@ PEG is supported while writing . please look ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG En@@ coder module is a tool to convert a number of pictures into a MPEG video in form of a slide .
the MPEG En@@ coder module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck . between the individual images you can add a basic image transition . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV file .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . finally , you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program to burn the medium .
you first need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . after that , you can create the module via Tools MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the pictures selected by you are then listed in the portfolio under image files . there you can also change the content of the images or the content of the list .
after you are happy with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to re@@ play the file on a TV , you must select the appropriate TV Standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that an image is displayed . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image change .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should let it black . you can set the name and path of the generated file under the name of the m@@ peg @-@ output file . if possible , keep the extension mp@@ g .
if you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your wishes , you can start coding the creation of the movie with the button En@@ coding . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now quickly or easily drink a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back .
if a note appears that you are missing Ko@@ di@@ ers or tools , you can customize the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck Pack@@ ages using the Settings button below .
the print wizard allows you to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve or print directly with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in the RA@@ W format in one of three formats J@@ PEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : do not expect d@@ cra@@ w to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the RA@@ W file to convert and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window then appears in the mode for a single image . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ color R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch does not have any effect .
once you are happy with preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . J@@ PEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it .
Tag@@ ged Image Format , TI@@ FF , keeps all information in your image and uses loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you plan to edit your images frequently or otherwise continue using them , you should not choose J@@ PEG format since it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose J@@ PEG as a storage format , the metadata that is included in the RA@@ W file is stored in the J@@ PEG file in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion using the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use ab@@ ort .
the batch processing mode allows you to convert several images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which is the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing file automatically . this is helpful if they have been created in an earlier attempt . however , previ@@ ew@@ ing is not available . the progress bar displays how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images from an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can make the image smaller or enlarge .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : res@@ izing in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option , for example , to adjust your image to the screen format .
not Pro@@ por@@ tional : not proportional scale in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
pre @-@ press : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo api@@ ece . the target image , including background size , border size and background color , is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you have started the module , the images -@@ window will be displayed with the pictures you have selected . you can add more pictures using a file choos@@ er dialog . for the last selected image , you will see a preview on the right .
you can also drag and drop pictures to the picture list and then add them to the list of images to be sent .
with the button Add images , the selected images will be removed from the list of images sent .
after you have selected all the images , you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the button OK . you just have to add the addresses and subject . the pictures selected by you are already attached as attachments .
don &apos;t mind sending too many pictures at once . most email accounts have limitations to the size of emails sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending images . your configuration is stored and used every time you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must install the G@@ Mail agent on your computer before . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments are added to the images in a text file and added to the mail .
the P@@ NG format under the images File Format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend you the J@@ PEG format .
if you select J@@ PEG under images file format and the original files are in J@@ PEG format , the original Ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is completed , the window will not be automatically closed to allow you to view the status messages , searching for errors . your e @-@ mail program will , however , automatically be started .
after starting the Advanced Di@@ ash@@ au module , a window with questions like you want to show your slide show appears . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL @-@ Transi@@ tions option in the presentation enables very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the file name option indicates that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an infinite loop . you can then manually break with Es@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the option images random@@ ly select ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of the images in the album .
the distance between the images can be set between the images . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . so you should test it before presenting your friends !
there are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can select . random@@ ly , each transition between the images chooses a different effect .
during the slide show you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to switch on .
with this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide show .
at the bottom of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation .

the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the working surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with comments , you can interact with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; through these browsers , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , there are now entries in each group , i.e. in persons , places and in the group keywords entries .
in the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your images and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current preview images . in the following each is described for each other .
if you click on people with the mouse , the view of the browser will change . see picture .
if you select another person only the images on which both persons are visible . through this selection method , you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images on a few individual images .
if you have selected all the persons , places and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of activity .
in the picture each person has the same icon in front of her name . you can save with &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person an own thumb@@ nail , This also applies to places , keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself .
to view images next to the names , select the button located on the right of the tool@@ bar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can select which view you want to use for each category . this has the advantage that you can display icons with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you must choose which image to display for each individual . to do this , you need to open the image @-@ View window ( described in more detail ) and display the entry categories editor in the context menu . here you can select the image for the corresponding person . in the View window you can adjust the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you call the search in the main window , a dialog appears , which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog once more .
if you enter a string into the cap@@ tion or description field , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to which you want to be searched ; the date may be either a part of the total file , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom of the window you can search all the pictures by specific names as you can see in the picture . here is illustrated by images on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather want to try the same features , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the home page of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start and photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo , if you can launch or photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select from the menu Help the menu entry c@@ photo@@ album ; demo . ther@@ eu@@ pon some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try .
if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the website of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document for downloading .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this list shows you date statistics about the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays another unit . you can change between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . in the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying the bar only 10 minutes sections .
the time bar can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of that date will be shown in the preview page ) and the tim@@ eline will always display the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in the preview list .
you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button and moving the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select an area , only images of this period will be displayed in the preview list . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a tim@@ eline bar .
&amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your images . one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as a module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create via the menu File HTML ...
before creating HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following each area is described more accurately .
first , enter the title of the title and a description that will contain the HTML file later . on c@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages see an example of these settings .
next , select if a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file is to be created which is to be seen on the overview page . you can find more information about the export files in .
finally , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid information that is obvious to the viewer without a description . for example , that all images are of a party . note that &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; currently all images are exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this section you can determine how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why they are not specifically addressed .
at the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images . thus , those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 cannot download images , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you set . so it can search your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transmission time . if you want to get a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , place the different folders and the URL where your site is stored .
best select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you need to select the main folder in which all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and added automatically next time . this allows you to select either a folder or a K@@ DE support protocol , for example :
after you have created your images , you can verify that they are all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created will start . the URL you specify here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them there . so that the import function , see , correctly you need to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings you just described have all three related to base folders or URLs . in them , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you specify in output folders .
if you are on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you may want to share your pictures with them . however , if you have already spent a lot of time on it , you will need to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures .
mit &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others to your database .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file , or if the file is only a link to images . the advantage of storing all images in the file is that you can attach all the images and pass this file as independent . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File Export menu ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , then the images of the URL that you have specified when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting pictures is described , which you can view over the File Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three choices available :
if you wish to copy Manu@@ ell to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally near the .@@ k@@ im file copy and photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zi@@ p files . because most of the images have already been compressed with J@@ PEG , and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you want to do so , simply select the Export File option .
the last option on this page is to limit maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you may not want to send the pictures in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
when you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu File menu , &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; import the exported database as described in .
the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , then , in which folders the import images are to be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category Person@@ s of the file to be imported ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) while this category is in your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog box , which categories of the file to import are to be imported , and which categories they correspond to in your database .
in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported , using the categories of your current database . for example , see the image .
it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your boy@@ friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will go through the various steps from ( 1 ) Set the information about your images , via ( 2 ) the browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this also includes videos with one .
&amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file in the upper@@ most folder of your images . it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in the CV@@ S , where they want .
&amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; notices the folder in which your images are stored and will automatically re @-@ use them on future star@@ ts . if you would like to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can start and photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . for example : c@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry settings photo@@ album ; set up ... you will get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , the different settings are explained .
to the left , you can see six different symbols with which you can view settings of previ@@ ew@@ ing and options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can access by pressing a button on the F1 key and click on the desired option .
it describes how you can define different properties for each image , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
view the dialog that is used to edit existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section Sub @-@ categories have already been mentioned . in Dialog Options , you can set up complete member groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group , rather than all groups of a group as explained in .
in the left part of the window you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window you will find a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; shares his modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ kam and g@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface .
the modules can be accessed via the modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; they are but sold separately . most modules however have a help page that you can access via the module itself .
because the modules are used by multiple applications together , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; therefore , you should always test new modules first with the demo database before using them on your own pictures The &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; demo database you can either use the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . do not say I wouldn &apos;t have warned you !
the applications that the modules over K@@ IP@@ I share in common are very different , which can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications impose their images in albums : an album is simply a folder . even if &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order is not supported , it simul@@ ates the order for albums for some modules so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album .
here you can see the current album , which is just the current view , so all the pictures that you see at the moment .
next to the current album , the modules also have to pass a list of albums . here is a review of the album , as follows :
if &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; s Browser shows the contents of a category , for example all persons , then each entry in this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you specified in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category Person@@ s , you will do &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; so do so , so if you would have selected people for the view and pass on it to the module .
since some modules with &amp; c@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . to do so , start the settings dialog and select modules to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to from any other K@@ DE application , you can see a tool@@ bar at the top of the tool@@ bar . under the tool@@ bar you will see the window that you can browse your image database . currently , there is not much information about your images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see each image with notes . this includes information about the persons depicted on the image , where the image has been taken , etc . you can use any picture either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if for example on all pictures Jes@@ per is shown and all pictures taken in Copenhagen are recorded .
all of these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view of three lists with a text box , you can define persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; since you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your images .
the following idea is based on shifting the images within the list : if you have a family party for example and shown on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can , thereby , that the names used are moved upwards , the persons find and assign to persons faster .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting by date under the list .
if you have selected notes for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images with notes . in this case , simply click on the front and back buttons , which are located at the top right of the picture .
if you have taken several images , e.g. with the same person , then it may be more convenient to mark all of these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as a super@@ group . to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the Com@@ ment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it in order to add it to a sub@@ category of this entry . note that this requires you to sort your categories alphabe@@ tically .
you can move the individual elements of the note dialog by clicking and moving the bars that form the top of the frame . you can also make your own window from a frame by dra@@ gging it outside the window area .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button Options ... which offers you , among other things , the possibility to save the current setup and look of the window .
you can also completely fade out a frame . if you want to see this window again later , use the button Options ... and then hide / hide windows . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the entry images in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all images if you have not set a filter . an example for this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply drag down the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . just try it .
if you drop an image on the background of your desktop , this image is set as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , it will be displayed in the picture viewer . if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the preview window . simply select the images you want to delete and press either the delete button or select Edit Select in the Edit menu . now the window you can see in the picture will be displayed .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; you can also use pictures without having saved them on the hard drive . of course , you must have saved the images somewhere , thus &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; you can view the view from &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive .
pictures in which the right upper corner is trun@@ cated are not stored on the hard drive . for example , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 the thumb@@ nails are present , so &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; you can view the preview of these images . however , you can also not view these images with the image viewer .
as you can see , this function requires that you copy files from the folders and copy them back again . so , if you want to avoid anno@@ y@@ ance , how to avoid the confusion of your images , please buy a larger hard drive to save all images .
in the View menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name Privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that the end is the ones you want to make in@@ accessible to others and click Rec@@ ent View in the Privacy Settings menu . alternatively , you can also select all the pictures that your little sister may see , and unlock everything except the current view .
this allows you to specify which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you give your laptop to your small sister , simply select the menu item to lock pictures , so all the images you have locked will be hidden . if you want to see the images again , click C@@ lock .
it is also possible to specify a password that must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select Password in the Privacy Settings menu .
please keep in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , anyone who can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are using &amp; photo@@ album ; not very familiar to forbi@@ d the look at private pictures .
the reason why you spend all your pictures with &amp; photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours on hours with it is natural that you want to look at them at some point . for this reason &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; via an image _ and video viewer . you can start from preview as described in .
you can see the viewer in the picture . of course he shows the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter through the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the info box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and go somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information should be displayed . all these options are available after right @-@ clicking on the viewer .
some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see , matching entries to this display . so , if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have uploaded several images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the image up and down the image . you can jump to the first and last image with tro@@ mb@@ one and end . these functions can also be accessed from the context menu .
if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can let them run as slide show . then you can control a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can enter the image and zoom out . to zoom in , you can simply drag a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us button , you can zoom out again The plus key zo@@ om@@ izes in the middle of the image . shows as a zoom rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zoom .
with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image will not be zo@@ omed . with the control button zo@@ oms , so that each pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work in videos that come in and zoom out with the plus and minus key .
with the revol@@ ving functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make comments to the current image with the menu item comments from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the image . in that moment you can open the view and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter these names . you may prefer to select only the image and view more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you watch one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to provide images with features while you look at them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking the corresponding letter . in the picture you see a picture where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set the features on your images , you can see them in your browser . so , if you print , print or whatever you have selected , you simply click on ann@@ ot@@ ations . this is described in detail . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and especially features can be displayed in preview . if you show categories in the preview view , you can add features to the pictures by simply press the characters for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; paint on the picture .
the batch is not saved with the image but in the database . in this way , you can reverse your painted later .
you can see a picture on which it was painted . to switch on the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , select View on the image from the context menu . to end the painting , just press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; to work , you must have the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you absolutely have read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire mode views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an object that is already selected , since all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar , or select a menu item in the menu item .
if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed to enable you to choose the correct position :
with del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right @-@ click context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene before .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to Apply these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can rec@@ tify the input errors and then click Apply or disc@@ ard the changes .
if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ User documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property tab .
preview in the tagged image and a small example of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross local .
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen the check@@ points disappear and a small cross appears in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse within the entire window .
each object as a wire model has a visibility step . you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected , or their visibility is smaller or equal to the level of view selected in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window ordering or if you need another arrangement , you can set it as you like . you can also store multiple shut@@ ters and simply switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window over or below one view , drag the p@@ asser to the top or bottom edge of a view . a rect@@ angle then points to the new position .
to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to place multiple views on top of each other , drag the starter in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the map tab at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to view a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the p@@ asser on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the cham@@ fer bar .
to close a view click on the small cross in the fas@@ cia bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them in any place .
you can save the current window view with the View window ordering ... saving it . a dialog appears where you can save the window ordering under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 topical . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene click on Ren@@ dering the Ren@@ dering icon in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry view scene render .
a render mode is equivalent to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes as you like , from a quick preview up to full @-@ quality images in highest quality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you click on the icon &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The render settings in the tool@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or in the View R@@ ender Mo@@ di menu , the following dialog will be opened : &quot; &quot; &quot;
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that lets you recognize the features of the mode .
in the size chart size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the inter@@ sec@@ ting field and enter the image section to render into the input fields .
in combination @-@ field quality you can select the properties , which &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this is done from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection lighting . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User &apos;s Guide to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel , different errors can occur . these pictures often have a Mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or tier effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel in the display . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , pictures with this property see better .
if you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and links &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than a ray per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling covers the adjacent pixels . the second method is adap@@ tiv @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sive because each pixel is repeated and adapted again and again because the recur@@ sion depth depends on calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray follows a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then both pixels are processed by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of four additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference then is :
types of abs ( 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the default threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which can be followed separately and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called j@@ it@@ tering . if you turn on J@@ it@@ tering , change &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the final setting for the quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; which calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can choose whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding rays have not hit any object .
opens a new window for display of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expectedly quit , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; select the Import menu item ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the complete command range of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; . if error messages or warnings appear when im@@ porting , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Begin and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds to the source code of the object in the open text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , just select the source text in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor , you can paste source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; likewise .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; render a scene . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in the Property View , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; User Docum@@ entation to the displayed object . set the path to your document and the version . support versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example high field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the scene folder , you also need to enter the path to those files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the view field in the camera view and in the window type license plates .
you can adjust the object capture of points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can adjust the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and turning .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the sphere you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
if you cross high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for extended projections , all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this property gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time to return .
if you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colours .
if you cross the floor , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colours .
if you tick the edge smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the section window instructions , it explains how to create and store window orders .
drop down sel@@ ector standard window ordering : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window ordering when starting the program .
the list of existing window orders shows all existing window instructions . a new layout can be created by adding the Add button and del@@ eting a selected layout with the button Clear .
each window ordering is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views for the selected window ordering . new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the button removal .
the position of the new window . with New column you create a new column on the right of the existing window , with Un@@ ten you will anchor the window under the existing window , with a map you get a map view in common with the previous view and flo@@ ats the view not in the main window , but generates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without any more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a sphere on one level .
however , you should consider the following warnings carefully before you complain that as a result you only receive a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your whole scene lies in the dark and you get only a black picture .
if you have installed everything error @-@ free , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window ordering :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing icons of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select Edit menu item Edit . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular note that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera are found . in the user documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; for more details .
do not change the camera &apos;s basic settings , this is reserved for later guides , but keep in mind that the camera has control points with which you can change the target of the camera . just click on a control point with the left mouse button and pull it to the desired location .
when you press the user or the input button , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , you see here the scene from the view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( insert End@@ ly Body Qu@@ ader ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but that is a complicated method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite layer as floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply button or the input button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now shows the plane as well , albeit at the moment only as a limited fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the plane stretches out to the horizon .
when you look at the object tree , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor by clicking on the + in front of the object . in this case , you will only see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene , you should move the floor to the exercise a unit below the horizon line just to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment select something simple .
in both cases a dialog opens , in which you can select how to insert the object . please select first sub@@ object . the pigment is then displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = floor @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the button preview , you can see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments shows only a matt black material , because you still have to enter settings for the pigment . therefore , always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on Pre@@ view . now enter the colors for the pigment . again , there are many possibilities , but take now the simplest .
if you don &apos;t see any color on the header and bul@@ let in the preview , click on the Apply button and then get the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result :
of course , these are not the colors you expected . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . in the object tree select the entry color list . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select one @-@ color each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should be able to run this step as you have already understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the sphere is just as easy to create as the floor :
in view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( don &apos;t forget to press the input button or the Apply button ) , so the ball has contact with the floor . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground , because you moved the floor to a unit down@@ wards .
of course , the rendering now yields a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears as a matt black material . in the next step , put a suitable material .
if you have chosen the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the floor , give the ball a pigment as a color :
select first sub@@ item and change the name for example in sphere pigment . click on sphere pigment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish features :
then change the values as in the following screen shots and click Apply or press the input button .
the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection already result in good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal is not selected yet :
you should now have a good impression of the possibilities offered by you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ ing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer escap@@ es hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that render the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected and broken by the objects , the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog . thus , the scene pixels are processed for pixels .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you watch the scene . without a light source you don &apos;t see anything , the picture is just black . obviously every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest item in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and a storage space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last saved memory are disc@@ arded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you still have un@@ saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last revers@@ ed command . you can select this menu item only if you have used editing .
stores the current window ordering and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new layout or over@@ write an existing layout .
in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the appearance , the short@@ cuts and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can use this option to set pre@@ defined Sh@@ ort@@ cuts for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; modify or add new commands .
opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can use this option to add tool@@ bar icons to &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; add and remove commands .
a dump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map .
basic shapes are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture mapping is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by applying an image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing .
images can either be displayed in an own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files you can click with &amp; L@@ M@@ B@@ n , or the Return key .
you can choose whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or if all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a suitable file name has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in Di@@ alogue Classi@@ fication - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and Processing and Sli@@ deshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set . in the other two , short instructions for the display window and short instructions for the browser , the short@@ cuts for each window can be specified .
if this is selected , the images are opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color , which you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
is this point enabled , loads &amp; cu@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay if you choose the next picture , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option stores &amp; cu@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when you exit the name of the recently opened folder . at the next start , open &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in the window mode the window is larger than the picture , the background will also be filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set up so that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can display the program as well .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determines whether the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field .
change the short@@ cut keys for the different modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show here ; in the flash@@ cards short instructions for the display window and short instructions for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in a window .
displays great icons for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short presentation .
displays preview images for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short presentation .
decreases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is open .
display the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; ist ein &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to contribute his part to at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ photo ; makes it as easy as possible to report bugs or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu contains an entry report to problems or wishes . if you use this , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ room@@ .net , then we would like to encourage you to join the user mailing list of &amp; show@@ room ; and hopefully soon you can answer questions from other users . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions for joining the developer mailing list from &amp; show@@ room ; .
&amp; show@@ photo ; try to give you so much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo ; change . to access these settings , you need to set up the settings dialog . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side .
in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator has been selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colors with what you are supposed to display . exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions on the selected images . the same side@@ bar is also available in the image processing . you can view them in which you click on one of the five tab@@ s :
&amp; h@@ ul@@ li@@ tes ; is an application for scanning images that do not do more than scan and save images .
&amp; # lite ; is a simple application for scanning images that do not do more than scan and save images . &amp; # lite ; can open a dialog for saving each image or save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images before saving .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE website by entering the information you need on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; chant ; with the command stream -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened , or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; # lite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not particularly handle these options .
to scan a picture , the user can start a preview and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview button will be started by the preview button .
in order to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits into the window .
if the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
when saving a preview in the settings before saving , the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en leads to a demoli@@ tion and you will get back to the main window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button opens the dialog box in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the user can view the image , if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows you to select the type of &amp; # lite ; to save images . open dialog for saving each image opens the dialogue in front of each sc@@ anned image . if you want to save this automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select saving without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are saved with the Save without having to ask for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder is used as the default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... Change .
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically stored images and is beyond that the proposed name for the image in the dialog to Save . the automatically stored image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is counted up each time a picture is saved . the # # # string is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if you select the image quality , then the default value of Q@@ t will be used .
the button Help starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; # lite ; manual . the button Über launches the K@@ DE About dialog for &amp; # lite ; the button Settings shows the dialog for the Settings and C@@ losing can be used to exit &amp; chant .

below you will find a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function below . the global keyboard short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and selecting Custom short@@ cuts ... select .
you can set up any existing multimedia buttons so they work as &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; this will make your keyboard a &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; control center .
Amar@@ ok &apos;s D@@ CO@@ P interface has many general functions , mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P features of collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist , and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally , Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog to enable the user to know why a script does not work .
begin require &apos; cor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ruby ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos;
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command ; each K@@ DE installation should be included .
most scripts allow the execution of external programs and commands . for this , the ex@@ ec ( ) function is usually used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this purpose , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should continuously monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore events when there is no use .
configure Wei@@ st the script to display the setup dialog . to save and store the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the work folder to the folder where all the data should be stored .
track@@ Change signals that a new piece is being played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions , the script could retrieve more information about the new piece ( for example , the metadata or the unit length ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume indicates a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
customize : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le controls the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a custom menu item is cli@@ cked . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le are also passed to allow the script to identify the cli@@ cked entry . to remove an entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p am@@ aro@@ k script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; ends itself , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to handle , for example , cleaning up data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web@@ server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend an archive name such as .@@ bz@@ 2 , so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as an Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the exhaus@@ tion amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages right away .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights :
when your script package is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and app@@ end the link to the Wik@@ i script page of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the am@@ aro@@ k category ; scripts .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; you can simply drag music into the playlist , rather than having to work through endless menus . maybe you &apos;re also looking for a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; &apos;s collections browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which one you want to listen to ? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music based on certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music . these and many more useful functions make Amar@@ ok the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right thing to experience your music anew !
usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
since &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should have no trouble when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of options available .
for some of the compilation options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . see the system requirements section for details .
activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; you should use full .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; can be set up without difficulty using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the different functions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; .
in the player window , the player window will also switch to a playlist . if the option is off , only the Play@@ list window will be displayed .
use V@@ oting bar@@ ometer : this function is only available when compiled and compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ Bar . this option turns on the experimental function of the V@@ oting bar@@ ometer .
create atmospheric shapes : this function is only available when compiled and compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ Bar . this changes the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
drop mood files in music files : this feature is only available when compiled and compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ Bar . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k settings ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / m@@ ood@@ Bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k should be started when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above .
save playlist when you exit , save the current playlist by editing &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the playlist in the ending .
relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , will be used . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
keep up @-@ to @-@ date piece when changing the piece causes the play@@ lists window to open / un@@ roll to keep the running piece always visible in the visible area of the window .
changing the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is being played .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can adjust &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the font section you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k . by selecting own fon@@ ts , the otherwise gra@@ yed section is enabled . you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : playlist window , player window and context browser . press Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the choice of Custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . to do so , use the color sel@@ ector activated for foreground and background color .
resume play at the start causes that &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; after program start , resume playback automatically with the piece at the point with which it has been stopped at the last stop .
set up on @-@ screen display lets you power on the O@@ SD . when using on @-@ screen display , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings directly in this preview .
the first option is font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
use your own colors gives you the possibility to adjust the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection . if own colors are not enabled , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used .
the Display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering of plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your own needs . below , you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is designed for X@@ iner@@ ama users , so you can specify on which screen of a multiple monitor environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the audio output card output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers still activate other settings in this map .
the card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . it includes the folder and type of the database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes for setting up how to process with the selected folders .
recur@@ sively search sub@@ folders : this causes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; both the check boxes and their sub@@ folders will search for music .
monitor changes : allows &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to monitor the selected folder to changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
im@@ porting play@@ lists : causes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k to add all found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection .
the collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down sel@@ ector driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further equipment is needed in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; on the machine : will enter the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , under port : the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data required to connect to the database .
the load card load .@@ f@@ m supports the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations for the current piece if necessary .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one at the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and update the profile : this setting allows &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
retrieve similar interpre@@ ters : after activating this setting , you can retrieve a list of similar interpre@@ ters to the played piece . you can view the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the k@@ deli@@ bs package and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; some of them need to be found for example modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minim@@ ally .
some functions such as the O@@ SD suggest that your window manager will keep the relevant standards from fre@@ ed@@ es@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but Flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file by logging in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b Develop@@ er on bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and create the collection again .
most of the time , it is because Tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer on bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is somewhat mature .
make sure that all libraries used by &amp; am@@ aro@@ k are compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b was compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when processing the met@@ a information .
if you are using K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable automatic switch off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens in a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ information , but do not mark them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script sol@@ ves the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ AR@@ P &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ P &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : m@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : m@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error while writing the tags from $ AR@@ P &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : m@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : m@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s symbols in the status bar ( Rand@@ om mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects will be forgotten . note that in some cases , you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows their effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this bug , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or adjust / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the right version first .
there are several possibilities . most installation problems are most easily solved by using an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in channel # am@@ aro@@ k .
bu@@ g@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please only use a bug there if you have something to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; only an empty playlist appears . how do music pieces come in there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left @-@ hand side and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist .
to keep the GUI very intuitive , the Start sub@@ window has been converted to the Statistics window . you will find it under Extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
to rate pieces , the review column must be displayed in the playlist . click anywhere in the new application column to specify the rating for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , then press Del on your keyboard . or right click on your selection and then select From Play@@ list Rem@@ ove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file to the playlist and drop it down , just as you would do with other files . it &apos;s as simple as that : - )
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , just next to the addition button , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Save Play@@ list &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button is saved . click on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
probably the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config is missing . re@@ install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install and am@@ aro@@ k ; new . look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
none . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the real question must be which media types supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support pretty much every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG !
it may ! maybe use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 de@@ co@@ ders are included in the default ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input button
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so , so ... &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; plays MP3 &apos;s : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you search for the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify another S@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ se@@ sink ) .
you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer is reading the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound server with highest priority ( real @-@ time pri@@ ori@@ tization ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure ar@@ ts@@ wre@@ cked su@@ id is set :
in K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia code@@ cs that can cause disturbed reproduction . read this bug report . enlar@@ ging the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either you don &apos;t use the Arts driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
you probably use the Arts Driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been heavily optimized for analy@@ zers ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less beams react to the visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes and am@@ aro@@ k . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( exit Amar@@ ok previously ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run exec@@ m@@ peg , once as system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder ( you will find the module folder with the latest @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . start now &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; .

&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm command this command : d@@ co@@ p am@@ aro@@ k player play
this command lets &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; start playing . make sure that &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; runs before you go to bed , then you will be arous@@ ed by the soft tones of music you have stopped before going to bed .
how to find the current in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; running tracks when you &apos;re on another computer ?
if a working SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user your@@ user name am@@ aro@@ k player nov@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and user name with your username . this assumes that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA file .
the visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k window . press the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , variable @-@ size window .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + Right mouse button links a piece in the queue to the queue . by pressing the input button after a search in the playlist , the first search result is played back and the search returned .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tricky features , but what about the symbol in the system portion of the control bar ?
click &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers are to be displayed .

the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired target folder in a kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , instead , take files from the folders mp3 or o@@ gg .

basically , this adju@@ sts the previous evaluation with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more the play has been played , the less influence each individual review has on the overall score .
you can enter the rating for a piece by right @-@ clicking on a column heading in the Play@@ list window . then you can change the rating of a piece as well as all other attributes , by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and editing : select the rating or press F@@ 2 . you can also edit the rating in the metadata dialog .
the developers don &apos;t want you to tell you when to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that is not compatible with the short @-@ term Amar@@ ok plan .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok that some users can also find annoying . disable the option icon while playing in the General Settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool bar ... and take the desired changes there .

audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to be sent to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and password . Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ;
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore also caused a lot of error reports .
probably &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled before you installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you need to re@@ configure and install .
now I have &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; new installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
you probably use a distribution that inst@@ alls the development files separately from the actual program . even though G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , you need to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . the same is true for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you need to re@@ compile and install again .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
their version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you must compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip of mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : don &apos;t use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you compile Amar@@ ok .

I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
set up Am@@ ok Settings ... Audio output specify the device . typically , example h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with on@@ board AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :

in the x@@ ine setup dialog , enter us@@ b @-@ audio , and output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the check@@ box on sound card supports m@@ map .
sorry , but the audio output with arts is not taken care of . of course you are welcome to take this problem by yourself ! if you like , you can become the new such urgently needed supervis@@ or for arts : )
listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard that is displayed at the first start of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; if you want to upgrade your collection later , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this quick start guide will help you . with their help you will have created &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; in a few minutes .
creating a playlist is very simple . drag some entries from the collection browser to the playlist . the small text field for filtering the collection makes it easier for you to search for certain pieces . if you are happy with the playlist , then you can save them with the help of a button playlist . you can find this button in the tool@@ bar of the playlist window .
if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have the option to import play@@ lists , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view .
to play an audio CD , please select actions audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with several folders and CD pieces in WAV format . simply drag the wa@@ v files to the playlist and then press the button Play@@ back .
the audio CD feature uses the protocol audio CD : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning feature is also available in the playlist . just right @-@ click on an entry and follow the burning menu . you have different options for burning a CD here .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; requires installing some software packages . the required packages are listed below . furthermore , some additional packages are listed , which make working with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; more enjoyable .
if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player has also &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; a player window with the most important functions . in addition , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; however , a playlist that is superior to all the others .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k are used , including the creation of a collection and a playlist .
the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; control center . at the top of the window is a run tex@@ tual display showing the currently running piece or current stream . directly below is the area that displays the game time , bit rate and sample rate of the current play . a click on this field changes the display of the already expi@@ red playing time to the remaining play time of the piece .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , even under the context menu . you can switch from the available analy@@ zer by clicking with the left mouse button on the area .
the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; -@@ Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , exten@@ sible window .
the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also located under the run @-@ text display . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window while the E@@ Q button is used to set up equ@@ ali@@ zers .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play position slider . use the slide controls to adjust the play position or volume . with the playback buttons you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or earlier piece .
the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio operators . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classical to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets .
to display the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the button E@@ Q in the player window . once you check the check box E@@ Q , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the Play@@ list of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is the most widely developed playlist of all available multimedia players . it has many features that are not available in any other player . but don &apos;t let the ple@@ th@@ ora of features frigh@@ ten them , they &apos;re all easy to use .
the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , the navigation area on the left . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser .
the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and performer . these three sub@@ windows are later explained in detail . they provide information about the current piece to different aspects .
if you have used earlier versions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k , you may notice that the sub@@ window has dropped off . the information displayed there is now divided into other parts of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the information in the statistics window can be collected ( Extras statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album .
the first area in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , performer and the album . below you see the cover picture of the album and beside it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to track the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
you can find more information about the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . here you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to display cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng will be supported . the context browser will also display covers images that were downloaded either with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the Recommen@@ ded Pi@@ ec@@ es are the favorite pieces of this interpreter . this section shows the five highest @-@ rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can choose which information to be displayed in the music sub@@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . when you click on an album , it will be opened and you will see the album &apos;s content .
you can click on all pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately . you can also right click on it and then select one of the options for adding the play or album to the playlist from the context menu .
this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is yet running , you can choose which should be started .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version will then be stored in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s collection database .
the search button searches a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing - group@@ ing only the top layer , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or genres are ignored .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - In addition , the pieces are arranged according to the artist . if you want to see con@@ stell@@ ations or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Vari@@ ous Interpre@@ ten .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Year - Album - Sor@@ ted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - Alb@@ um@@ name is used .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically among each other . the interpreter is ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - your songs are sorted by genre , including by artist .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This attitude works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the artist .
with the help of the remaining buttons you can adjust and combine group@@ ing at will .
with the last button , you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; will automatically re @-@ capture your collection once you change something at the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this might take a while .
a search filter is located right below the tool@@ bar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . instructions for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter you will find a selection box with which you can filter the recently added pieces to your collection . you can choose different time windows , starting from the last 24 hours to a year . furthermore , you can also select your total collection , which will enable the filter to be switched off practically .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will get the following options .
loading - This will empty the current playlist and add the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play .
atta@@ ching to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will reach the same effect .
set items in queu@@ es - This function will add the selected pieces to the queue . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as playlist . you &apos;ll be asked for a name under which the list is to be stored .
transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces into the queue for transfer to the media player . for more details , see the section on the Media Player browser .
burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - thus the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) move files to the tr@@ ash bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark as a composition - Sel@@ ects the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears under different interpre@@ ts .
pick up selection - Change a album marked as a compilation back to a normal album . the album will then no longer be displayed under different performers but again under the accompanying interpreter .
the play@@ lists browser simpli@@ fies the handling of many play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains intelligent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click Smart Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist . there , you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Media player sub@@ window will be used for the connection of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; for example , it must be embedded in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; started , you will find the pieces sorted on your iPod by interpreter in the upper list view of the media player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired songs from the playlist and drop them to the performer list . if you &apos;re done , click Apply . by doing so , the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . if the transmission is complete , stop &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; and lo@@ osen the drive connection for your iPod .
the tool bar is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar that lets you pick music from a given URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press input button , you can access music in the music .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z file . now you can drag the music from there to the playlist and drop .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , it can be difficult to attach files by simply drop down . in this case , holding down the Shift key may be useful : thus , dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position .
the playlist contains all pieces attached to you to play . you can change the order by simply drag the entries to the desired location using the mouse . once you enter the letter there is a text box in which you can enter a filter . in order to reset the filter , press the back button until the text box is empty again .
if you enter separate search terms by spaces , you will search for entries that contain all search terms . if you enter , for example , one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all items containing one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) are found .
if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then en@@ close the search term with full @-@ foot@@ ed feet : Mike Old@@ field . this is searched for entries that include Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This search for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a certain search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : - something looks for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syntax variants as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR scores : &gt; 50 comment : bad . this looks for all the pieces that include either Mike Old@@ field , or a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bad .
you can set the sequence of entries by holding the C@@ tr@@ l key , and right @-@ clicking on the entries in the desired order . entries then receive a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left , you will find the Add button that lets you add the playlist . to the right , you can save play@@ lists , empty play@@ lists , and assign mixers .
next , follow the undo and restore buttons , so you can undo or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the tool bar is a unique , magni@@ fied analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted with one click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that which you get in the player window on the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; &apos;s configuration .
there are many more available buttons for the tool@@ bar , for example , ren@@ dition controls and volume controls . you can set up the buttons shown by clicking on the menu and selecting tool@@ bars ...
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it shows the title of the current play , the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval can be easily changed by double clicking with the mouse in the corresponding display area .
you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the status bar flag in general settings .
the context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the playlist on the menu . by this menu , you can reach the settings of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k .
one click on this entry opens the window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins . there you can select the visu@@ ali@@ zations of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; select .
behind this entry is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; .
the cover management is a useful tool to manage your cover images . you can start them by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management includes a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the performer on the left .
with the View menu , you can choose what is to be displayed in the cover management . select from :
the queue management got your big entry into &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 . with this feature , you have even more control over the playlist . after you set a piece in the queue , the playlist appears in the playlist . this number represents the order in which &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the pieces will be played first , 2 as second , and so on .
queue management will open via Tools waiting queu@@ es . if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the item in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces to the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are pre@@ determined ( the details of setting up these will follow later ) .
fills your playlist with random items from your entire collection , adding more random items while playing .
adds pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ ber ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you do not need a load .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist to work .
double click on the play@@ lists you want , drag it into the playlist window or right @-@ click on it and then choose Lo@@ ad . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . so you should save the old playlist by the circumstances !
the two default modes of mix and playlist mix immediately fill your playlist and you can start playing directly . the playlist Recommen@@ ded pieces will start with an empty playlist , and you must add at least one piece yourself from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added to the next piece change , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as the starting point .
the New button bu@@ ckets the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit Play@@ list opens the dialog to edit the playlist , and you can change the appropriate settings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a right click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; then the dialog will open to edit the playlist settings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here , enter any name for the playlist . however , the name should be unique in order to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and you will not hear it twice in this playlist . if the setting is active , the pieces already played will be removed , taking into account the settings played .
pieces played - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each piece played . if you click here more than 1 , the playlist will continue to grow as only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross multiple play@@ lists , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; add random items from each of the play@@ lists selected .
some scripts allow your own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then clicking on alignment .
you can install new &amp; am@@ aro@@ k scripts by clicking on a script . it will open a selection dialog in which a script package to install . after you have installed the script , a new entry appears in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . to do this , use the Other scripts button .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script longer , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to delete from then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please refer to the Scrip@@ ting section for writing scripts .
the dialog window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins are used to enable the available visu@@ ali@@ zations in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the window contains a list of all available plu@@ gins . to use a plug @-@ in , simply enable the check box next to the name .
this quick guide will show you how to create an audio CD in four steps . to follow the steps , you need to have a smart installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed formats then remember that you will get a po@@ orer quality when re@@ encoding to MP3 , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD has been created by a loss@@ less format .
in this dialog box , you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has finished the burning process .
this quick guide will show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; copy a data CD in just four steps . to follow the steps , you must have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and have inserted the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please select Extras , copy CD ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you now see a dialog that looks like this :
in this dialog window , you can follow the progress of the copy process . once the reading of the original is completed in the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium to which the data should be burned .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you now have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you now have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
the Q@@ T designer tool U@@ IC can &apos;t find the &amp; k@@ de ; wid@@ get modules . to fix this problem start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / li@@ b / k@@ de@@ 3 / plu@@ gins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS by your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b website is available at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org where you will receive the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you can also get feedback from the forums and get some news from the forums .
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you need at least &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a flow ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the features that also &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; therefore sel@@ ects &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , higher quality with burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional technology for audio encoding and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and en@@ coder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder , which can compete with commercial en@@ co@@ ders in terms of quality and speed . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 En@@ coder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code@@ c for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio en@@ coder module , allowing you to read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg , it is possible , for example , to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : an auxiliary program that can convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio En@@ coder module .
Trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a full @-@ featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ sing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to customize the volume of music files to a standard level . this can be useful e.g. to create mixed CD &apos;s and m@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the unpleasant effect that the music pieces are reproduced differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically return all videos to the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to relo@@ ad recently opened projects . the accompanying sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on one entry opens the project .
save the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file is over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialog Save is displayed , with which you can choose folders and file names for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as you would call for each individual project file .
closes the current project . if a project has been modified and not saved yet , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then disc@@ ard between saving and changes . you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open .
closes all open projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each un@@ saved project what is meant to happen , just as if you had called for each project file .
closes all opened projects and finished &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project , you will be asked what to do with it as if you had called the closing file .
when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . it has the same effect as if you drag the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
this dialogue is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; the only difference is the burning of the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened when the project already contains data .
open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described via the What is this ? -@@ Rem@@ edy ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video @-@ DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful when you compile files for a multiple session CD . this is useful for you , even if this function is not used . it is intended for you rather than help , so that you can see the files and folders already available on the media .
this function only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video @-@ DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
this allows you to copy a CD to another medium , even without the project file . alternatively , you can only create an image from a CD , which you can then burn later . besides , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this allows you to copy DVD to another medium without project file . alternatively , you can only create an image from a DVD , which you can then burn later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . furthermore , the conversion / reduction of a DVD with the help of the copy dialog is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to accommodate the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form .
opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW , which allows you to delete all content or parts of a CD @-@ RW drive .
opens the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which allows the content to be completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
burn a pre @-@ created CD image . the dialog promp@@ ts you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a source of data which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog will prompt you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a source of data , which can then be fired immediately by pressing the burning button .
this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used everywhere . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings , and even ways to change the size and cut black edges .
displays information about the inserted media . this information is displayed in the content view and include features of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is enabled , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not enabled , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view includes an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their contents will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and unlock the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium .
the Content View allows selecting and dra@@ gging files into the view view . the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the head bar is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head bar has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the view from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box for modi@@ fying the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key signature to the bottom .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . system administrator privileges are required for this , so you have to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when starting the wizard .
open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work immediately . this dialog is for custom@@ izing and adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many others &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script , for example .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line , or use the slightly more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , therefore your taste and type of task is decisive , which of the programs you give preference .
in this chapter , we assume that you are using the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to be able to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; you need to make sure you have started before , that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions common to all &amp; k@@ de ; program in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other features to generate new projects .
void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which can only be used for data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String ) void returns ( Q@@ String ) void returns ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String ) void returns ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void set@@ Volume ID ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void set@@ Volume ID ( Q@@ String )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then add files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface Cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T add@@ ur@@ l / home / tru@@ ffle / some@@ fi@@ le.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ reader for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it can easily be read audio CD ; s can be read out and stored in MP3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the en@@ coder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in wa@@ v files on the hard drive ) and by many encoding those that en@@ code these wa@@ v files . currently l@@ ame for MP3 , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression ) are currently supported ( These Ko@@ di@@ ers must be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in wa@@ v files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these wa@@ v files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) are compressed into the mp3 or O@@ GG format or also in other formats such as the loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must now be done .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other comp@@ ilers must be installed . all of these programs are usually already available for any Linux distribution , so it is very likely not necessary to compile it yourself . however , only the Ko@@ di@@ zer packages must be installed which are needed . if for example FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is also not required .
which coding / file format is to be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ zer gives a small introduction to Ko@@ di@@ zers , Audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to crack any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device does not cover the protection , it is not possible to read the mechanisms of copy protection . simply avoid buying pir@@ ated audio CD ; s !
while the setup needs to be done only once ( but the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily use of reading a &amp; CD ; on the hard drive explains . this will ( hopefully ) lead to the understanding of the lean approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble over in the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which code@@ c programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without a network , all manually recorded .
this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . on the page , step by step , you will find more information on how this program is used , as well as screen shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
start the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB @-@ tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; start reading and - if an en@@ coder was configured in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Code &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab in the setup directive - the coding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available en@@ co@@ ders , so the selection can be read with another En@@ coder as the default . it is important to note that previously the en@@ coder was configured in the En@@ coder tab in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already selected file is selected for encoding rather than a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , Pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as read &amp; CD ; exit ) .
opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( such as en@@ coder , to set up the en@@ coder ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , comp@@ ilers and compression ratios and helps you select the correct coding .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression ratios and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate , the differences become less important , since both comp@@ actors produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ nt so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still provided free with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly lower quality with lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard on a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play devices is present .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces and has a very high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a song . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et ins@@ ane &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality regardless of the size of the file , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information retri@@ eved manually or fet@@ ched through the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used with &amp; k@@ audio Creator ; and the encoding program to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of programming settings for the Ko@@ di@@ ers and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the coding machines explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; to add title to the keywords ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are en@@ coded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t from l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; will be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button description in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download information instead of themselves into the computer . it is important to note that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( editor of the translator : this means the author ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent that you from the &amp; CD ; information released publicly on the CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music business can be har@@ med .
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is actively to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( fal@@ si@@ fied ) address as the one in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( this can only know the programmer who checks the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b it should be used ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest to the nearest mirror server . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more about it , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; please note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package needs to be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this has not yet happened .
to save the read wa@@ v files , the code@@ c and thus the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening , pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression for audio data ) are located on the tab to set up the encoding .
the Ko@@ di@@ zer package must be installed by the Linux distribution concerned before the code@@ c can be used . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined code@@ c . more information on Ko@@ di@@ ers is available in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ zer .
after installing a coding , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and reading rights on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio code@@ c of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give an indication of what is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; to do so , check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this won &apos;t work !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , you can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; read . we &apos;ll use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to produce MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can for example be found with a search engine as it is considered non @-@ free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which of course you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission to it ( eg by trying to copy something into / usr / share ) .
the first section covers the basic setting up of &amp; k@@ audio@@ kill@@ ers ; , something that is probably just done once and
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD .
here we determine the required encoding for the compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them with any reading of a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the reading program to read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
here is not much to do here . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything will be left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only select in@@ complete information so that you will be informed if information is missing to generate keywords ( tags ) .
simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server during the reading of the &amp; CD .
the second drop @-@ down sel@@ ector is easier , becomes a &amp; CD ; entry will start immediately reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entr@@ ys , they can be easily changed . the directory name or file name will be changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can work with fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to use the database before . however , this is over 6@@ 20 MB large , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card card .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data query , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b servers via the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section above fre@@ ed@@ b .
mode : we didn &apos;t download the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load between the hosts is distributed . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equally as far as the server is concerned , as many fire@@ walls cache the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the 80 protocol , as the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example , we do not want to send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activating the first check box should be enough .
just take over the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the / tmp folder exists on your computer )
number of simultaneous pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know , therefore simply try .
CD ; after reading the last piece , throw this to the &amp; CD ; disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be specified the path / folder in which the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to make something with the wa@@ v files yourself .
enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be smoo@@ thed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneous WAV files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than one wa@@ v file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic set up of &amp; k@@ audio@@ kill@@ ator@@ .@@ This configuration is used as the default for any reading of a &amp; CD ; used . if you have wis@@ ely chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
in this section we describe how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard disk runs . we will create and setup MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard drive , was written in the previous section and set up . first , a connection to the Internet is built , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each reading &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a bit different from those for one &amp; CD ; with successful from fre@@ ed@@ b fet@@ ched data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; to manually enter data instead of extrac@@ ting them from the Internet . comments will point to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this has not yet happened , now the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screen shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; can be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , look in the questions and answers section for help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully fet@@ ched by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the songs are already filled and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; there is a window appears , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but get the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - Input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; current title &apos; input field , the rest of the data in the &apos; Album &apos; input field .
the artist must no longer be entered in the &apos; current title &apos; input field unless you have a composition with different artists for each piece .
the bottom commentary box can be used for individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ ally per piece , the album comment field is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words with capital letters begin or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least to what &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; maximum allowed . this option is set on the En@@ coding Settings tab .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later with tag editor at any time . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all the coding / file formats . see the help file for more information .
simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org &apos;s website and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after choosing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you come back to the main window . just click on the row with the second piece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD editor window appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the input data we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the field of the current play .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
note : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be shown above the product list .
note that there is a check sign in front of each line of a piece . only the tracks that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line sh@@ uts down the selection of the piece , or press the button All items selected at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
when clicking on the button selection has started reading the selection process , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on .
click on the tab@@ s to switch to the order window . it is located in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is currently being read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the bottom left of the window in the status bar .
this error message will see if you are trying to work with a code that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully en@@ coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folder are not what we have typ@@ ed here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment # 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into MP3 format . thus , reading and coding are parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . with performance @-@ sensitive machines , the result is unclear .
now the last title is read out while another piece is en@@ coded and a third order is placed in the queue of the en@@ coder . after the last piece is en@@ coded , a small window with a message appears for a short time in the top left of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio Creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the Ko@@ di@@ zer of your choice .
you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions contain a pre @-@ compiled package as &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; most of the distri@@ butions contain a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . if you read this , you probably already done it ...
this section is intended for people who compile from source files , and are not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many variations of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the various settings of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked on after the first start of the program , without any clu@@ e as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD at the time of the program starts ; in the drive ) , or from an unusually short menu ?
what is it all about ? anyone reading this has probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can &apos;t maintain this manual . it &apos;s the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; thought . whoever wants to add or change something useful may do it . at least only after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore in agreement with this proposal .
strange if you have managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these informations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ ie of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke live recording of lyrics , it also has some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver that is needed for G@@ US maps . al@@ sa is involved as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop to drag &amp; drop ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; drag and drop windows to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards in order to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) .
session support . when you play &amp; k@@ de ; when playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the tool@@ bar , select the record from the menu item , or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( for several pieces , they are added to a collection and then played sequ@@ enti@@ ally . )
as soon as you play a piece , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and driving with the knob .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the tempo display and adjust the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played a pressure on the space bar like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item , thus interrup@@ ts the play . pressing the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text @-@ event , others use song @-@ word @-@ event and again other both . some pieces have no text at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set what events are to be displayed and even better : the type of event is determined automatically , which uses a song so that you don &apos;t have to set anything manually . so , if you activate the entry Automatic text selection in the Settings menu , the kar@@ aoke text will automatically be selected . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set up an event type , select the entries in the menu item or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you summari@@ ze . these are played back in series . in this section , you can see how to use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find them in the collection under the point Organ@@ izing .... Click New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking Cop@@ y and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . at the beginning , this collection will contain the same songs as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can set each of the bund@@ les in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . remember that when you add a lot of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song with the Add button . again , the file dialog appears , with which you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Ad@@ ding to the collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when you open ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
if Automati@@ cally Ad@@ ding to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the continued pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the sub@@ menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the select list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to jump a song further , select the button next song , record next song from the menu item or press the button arrow on the right .
to jump back a song , select the button Previous piece , record Previous piece from the menu item or press the button arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter as it is not saved when you leave &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers which are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General MIDI events translate into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano into events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always lets a trumpet sound if originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM equipment and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you need to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all the necessary requirements for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the Key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , the prerequis@@ ite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an email , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
this section describes how the patches of General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general usage looks like this :
please note that the left side of the gender sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you must not change the order , nor leave any line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all the sounds that this instrument requires to sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun fire ( GM patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun shot . to do so , enter the following in the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 ( gun fire ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file .
please note that here is meant with the term drum patch of the patch , where each sound represents a different percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the tone is the pitch of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) .
the Key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are m@@ apped on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define several key maps for each channel and instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly to map tones on the percussion channel . see for example the supplied keyboard maps .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swap the first and second channel , just make it in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI channel 10 , others need 16 or 9 channels ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel that is shown on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the keyword will need to be defined with the name name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will attempt to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x will always be used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful for example to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multip@@ lied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ benefit event with the value n , it is converted with the n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used to prevent decim@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM pre@@ tends that a keyboard , which is supposed to play a pitch benefit event with the value 40@@ 96 , should play a sound higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards are trying to play two sounds up to one oc@@ tave . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . you can find it in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you can see which sounds are being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the View channel view ( until now ) has two different views to display the played sounds . in the View menu , select View Vie@@ wing view : settings
the speed @-@ LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you get a similar sound quality . in a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files separately .
OK , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
by default , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the standard tempo , double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have on one &amp; k@@ de ; Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or attached ( if I play a MIDI file ) or I want to play a file , merely switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows and drag the desired file into the &amp; k@@ mid window .
if you only want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , disable automatic addition to the collection , and the new one ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ M. , B.@@ M. and C.@@ mid@@ . first you only want to play the first file . so set the setting Automatic Ad@@ ding to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly those a MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ M. and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , that anim@@ ates me to program on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can of course not hear music .

for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always a window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that is only displayed when information is returned .
it is possible to save the preferred links under the book@@ mark menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent playlist .
of course you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy . when you click an entry , its group and all its sub@@ sets are copied to the current category and the reproduction starts with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current play &apos; , TV and permanent play@@ lists can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course you can only do that if &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; not running . the different files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ Player folder can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself .
after changing XML files , select the same playlist from the menu and select either the editing mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without matching the playlist .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; some functions can only be enabled by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will notice the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / c@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during start @-@ up doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . however , this would be annoying at the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore end the application a second time .
a simple example of a startup animation can be displaying a favorite picture : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ - ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ;
there is a Ri@@ der for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player configuration dialog ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; in the tool@@ bar of K@@ M@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer .
there is no tab for this playback device in the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player configuration dialog ; everything must be configured by manually editing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c file , such as setting the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a flash is played with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be played inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even be added to the special em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order for the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; module must be specified as service provider for the Mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file As@@ sets of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library . the started process is called cra@@ mp@@ layer . if there are no errors here , the back@@ end issue is within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
so that a given back@@ end is taken for a given mim@@ e type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , it must be done manually by modi@@ fying the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c file . for example , phon@@ on should return all o@@ gg files :
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either by means of M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be di@@ gest@@ ed , the device must be used and the TV channels can be configured .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Rec@@ order ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , you can use the dialog in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ e- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there you should recognize ports from which one is selected . the correct name probably has a dv@@ b contained in it .
because the V@@ DR support of K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this kind of playing video devices under Linux is the only one ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension must be functional for the X server . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally , K@@ M@@ Player uses various names for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , these are dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ version , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source .
is there any clu@@ e how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command is to run as a user root after the device is inserted . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom can be found on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts only slowly , why does each time my CPU needs to be tested for its performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ led . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to compile &amp; ki@@ le ;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems , probably on the package &amp; text live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components may be included in the &amp; Linux ; distribution . for the installation the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; -@@ project contains some already compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are contained on the box ; website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly need to read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is requested , contact via the box ; -@@ website should be established .
if you have any questions or compile &amp; ki@@ le , please refer to the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; Desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this one simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . in conclusion , the easy to use wizard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about posters ; and to learn its options , the manual should be used to Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right language : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is difficult to use , it can also use a lay@@ on ( lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; mac@@ ros . a less demanding but realistic explanation is that it comes from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
in this case only a good overview of &amp; lat@@ ex is given , it is not the ultimate book for it . to be able to master correctly , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
the introduction contains at least the command \ \ document@@ class , the body starts with the command \ \ cease { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } .
the quick entry wizard by &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for the quick creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers some options for creating the document . some settings related to the document can also be made .
document classes : this is the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ t@@ cl &#93; , Book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ t@@ cl &#93; , Proj@@ ector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , Fo@@ ils &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; , Fo@@ ils &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or custom .
encoding : this sets the character encoding . it should use the character encoding of the system . modern systems are increasingly using UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for the correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ on packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration it only has to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( for compliance with German DIN regulations ) . you should always find use when creating German texts .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . they are merely a brief description of the functions and further information on this are given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - as well as other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as un@@ matched ) . if you see larger areas of a large text on the screen , it is with great likel@@ ihood that some mathematical environment has not been closed .
with automatic completion of the surroundings is created by entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the associated row to the sh@@ rou@@ d of the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the menu settings box ; La@@ Te@@ X commands may be disabled .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document to the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a single click of the mouse .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex , file recovery can be very helpful . once a DVI ; file is created , skip and ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button on the DVI ; viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the standard output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the back scan , the elements of the DVI ; file is plu@@ gged with the editor , and as soon as an element in the DVI ; file was cli@@ cked , the exact opposite of it . as soon as a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text was cli@@ cked , the corresponding location in the DVI ; viewer was jumped .
master document : this feature is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , work is simplified with other .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document on project project settings can be set .
rapid build : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is displayed automatically ( unless there is no error in the source code ) .
video surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is supported on Ã ¶ n@@ der@@ ungen@@ â , and there is no call of &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick construction .
when viewing the Edit Tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for the fast entry of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for the rapid breakdown of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for the division are :
the Other is for submitting articles such as keywords , fu@@ elling notes or references . the available options are :
name : with this command , a name for a section , a picture or a different element is created .
reference : used for reference to a specified designation ( select a selection box possible ) .
the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files may also be written in &amp; ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last drop @-@ down box named Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for determining the font size . the fon@@ ts for the main text , gro@@ unding no@@ des etc. can be set . the following fon@@ ts are available :
when calling &amp; ki@@ le , two options are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting document type and placing the settings . 2 . the document can be written from the bottom up with the hand .
the brackets after the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; defines the font . if the font is not specified at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
as soon as the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the simplest way to do this is to use the menu build or the press of a button .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; for saving automatically .
if the document is comp@@ iling , it should be searched for errors in logging . if you are using the Quick Start &amp; Ok@@ ular@@ line , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the recording should also be taken into account .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font 12 is created and only a few sli@@ ts should have another font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } allows the change of the fon@@ ts within the environment â t @-@ w@@ aking .
changes are supervised only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , bold prints , ital@@ ics , under@@ scores , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the ital@@ ics pressure and is as long as it is closed with a \ end } or any other environment . a single word in a set can be displayed itali@@ c with \ \ tem@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . quote starts with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
after the background to write the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language is displayed , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; ki@@ le ;
as soon as a little text has been entered in the wizard , some adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be executed . to do this , at least one quote , a few places in bold and ital@@ ics , and a poem are to be applied in order to see the differences between these commands .
once the document has been viewed , the editor view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be revers@@ ed back to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) .
once the DVI ; file was created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun .
these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; the same steps are necessary for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can then be printed ( in the viewer ) by file ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text , the conversion into desired other formats can begin with the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the preview search allows the direct jump from the editor to the appropriate position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a suitable setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex . for this purpose only Modern under Settings box must be set up ... Tools construction will be balanced .
in order to select the preview search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source text and then click on preview searching . the jump to the appropriate location in the DVI ; viewer takes place then .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document from &amp; ki@@ le ; open and jump to the corresponding line . to do this &amp; ki@@ le ; in &amp; oc@@ cul@@ ars ; set in &amp; oc@@ cul@@ ars ; set in &amp; oc@@ cul@@ ars ( Settings Ok@@ ular@@ line ... Editor )
if the &amp; DVI file doesn &apos;t open , a fault can be found . if there is a fault , it will be displayed in the log file or in the news window .
the logging file er@@ ects the source code of the source code . in the editor , the buttons of the La@@ Te@@ X errors and the key La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used for jumps between the errors . the log file must always be cli@@ cked on the error in logging and &amp; ki@@ le ; jump to the defective line .
when cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template used for the document . the default options are :
when selecting a blank document , a document can either be re@@ written or the wizard will be used for the quick creation of a new document . for more information , see the section .
frequent users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; ki@@ le ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or a new file will be created . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting File template from document ...
when creating a new document from a file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in settings box ... settings can be adjusted .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by the entry in the document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ arian &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { item } .
the simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated command in the editor . once the document has been created this way , the following steps must be executed :
when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the standard .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files . if a simple way to create a template is needed , one should search for one in the internet and the steps described below .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and producing of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for posters ; can be made directly from &amp; ki@@ le in the menu .
to learn more about it and its possibilities , the manual should be used to Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with the reading of the chapter work with the editor of &amp; kate .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex command reference , which can be called over the Men@@ e.@@ Help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands in &amp; lat@@ ex , and its syntax .
double @-@ click with a cli@@ cked C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; meaning that in this way , clicking on \ \ par from \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
when dra@@ gging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed shift button , parts of the source code can be selected in the Edi@@ ting Pan@@ e .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to search and highlight the most different types of source code . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from normal text and also mathematical formul@@ as are distinguished by a different color .
many assistants can capture additional boun@@ ce marks . this is an own type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu entries , start @-@ brands or the corresponding but@@ ton@@ back allows the jump to the next or last jump mark . thereby , this jump stamp is also highlighted so that it is automatically heard when entering a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; ki@@ le ; although &amp; Po@@ sters ; already excellent options were added in &amp; ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code always includes many environments and groups , and therefore supports &amp; ki@@ le ; special commands for their selection .
this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code .
select the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , as this command also creates &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a back panel ( \ \ ) and a additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del key . &amp; Po@@ sters ; provides the key C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides with its own commands here for a faster capability .
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; ki@@ le ; is included in the description to Edit select paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore &amp; Ki@@ le ; for other commands under Edit surroundings for a possible easy work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to connect the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is located before or within the command \ \ begin { surroundings } , it will jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted environment commands , the overview of the environment can quickly be lost . this command removes the recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups specified by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond to those from the editing environment .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed right in front of the opening bracket .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the sharpen@@ ed closing bracket .
if the cur@@ sor is located before or behind the sharpen@@ ed clamp of a &amp; tex ; group # , the group jumps to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted group@@ ed brackets , the overview of the structure can quickly be lost . this command completes the last opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups is not destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex , two simple guide signs are used as a symbol . for the purpose @-@ carrying execution is used in &amp; ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; for two simple application symbols . &quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and carries two definitive signs for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic double @-@ stop feature can be set up under Ki@@ le settings ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
it can also be used for specific settings ( e.g. , English or French ) and for German or French applications . there are also many other languages available .
when shifting shift ; En@@ ter &amp; ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; ki@@ le ; not only a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item .
complete the current line with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pres@@ et &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be placed under Settings Ch@@ le ; Set ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . at the click of Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; ki@@ le ; after the next tab in the underlying line .
although &amp; kate ; already providing a good source code completion , it has been added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; there are several different modes built @-@ in . three of them work according to demand and the other two are for automatic completion . all of these modes can be set for different modes of operation under Settings Ch@@ le ... To be adjusted .
start a new environment using the command \ \ begin { surroundings } &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { surroundings } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
at the click of the back button , the last letter of the input will be removed and , unfortunately , the complete list is created . on the other hand , the list may also shrink by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are natural when selecting a command . alternatively , the descriptions can be inserted by &amp; ki@@ le , so that a simply jump to these positions is possible with the Edit Jump@@ start brand N@@ Ã ¤ ste boun@@ ce mark and the desired parameters can then be added .
under Settings Ch@@ le ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; All settings can be made to these lists . there can be different lists of lists for tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands as well as wishes of general language use can be selected .
command mode is not useful for changing environments . there must always be a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the call of completion mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for loc@@ ating environments .
when calling the Com@@ preh@@ ensive mode over the menu edit mode , or the Alt + Shift key , the command will automatically be opened to open the environment and it will appear \ \ begin { . after that , the environment completion can be continued in the simplest way and termin@@ ated by pressing the input key .
once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; ki@@ le ; realize that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be included .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; Cre@@ ate ... Ki@@ le ; All settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of completion mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supports custom lists of paragra@@ phs that are immediately replaced by longer strings . lists can be set up under Settings Ch@@ le ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ sions can be set up . as an example of a check list , the ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l file , for example , is included in L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word completion mode is introduced over the menu Edi@@ ting or the C@@ tr@@ l + Alt key key , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large Ã ¶ r@@ ter books are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been found that many W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ters are written more than once in a document . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the completion for all the already written wishes .
this mode can be set up in the menu settings box ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ sions can be de@@ ported . here , the threshold value for displaying compensation can also be specified .

the graphics edit dialog designs the inser@@ tion of graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of graphics formats , the sections should be ignored .
PS files are not as well known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
in order to examine the results of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the menu creation compilation , conversion and creation of view summari@@ zed .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used the Alt ; 2 key ; after that , the DVI ; file can be viewed in the standard Viewer by Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted to a PS file and viewed using Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the quick @-@ build command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window will open each time .
a new project will be asked about the project New Project .... This is where the following information is available for the project :
when filling the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ ki@@ wi@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows the execution of the EC@@ MA@@ script code . scripts can be managed above scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts have not been developed yet , and may change in other versions of &amp; ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of scripts in &amp; ki@@ le is a system @-@ wide object ( = box ) with the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different aids to support the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; ly@@ live ; are shipped with many documents , including a documentation for the packages contained and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and is thus ideal for searching for a particular format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; Ki@@ le ; in three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / text live ; the finding of the right document is not always easy . as possible help provides &amp; tet@@ ex ; / ly@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all documents and for a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or keywords . from &amp; Ki@@ le ; only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source code editor for various architec@@ tures of &amp; Linux ; - and Unix @-@ like systems . &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also part of the Fink project , thus &amp; Ki@@ le ; also on &amp; Mac ; can be executed with OS X installed .
much thanks to those who strive for the continuation of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project and offer for many hours for the development of tools that we all can use with respecting the &amp; GNU ; current information about the contribut@@ ors there is in the menu Help@@ ber &amp; Ki@@ le ; .

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . the signatures interface you in the graphical user interface of &amp; k@@ sig ; . with the command line interface , you create random signatures or day signatures from a list . this command line interface provides the signatures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig will be read out . by many signatures with different quotes , styles and information , you can create your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for day signatures , the same signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read for the whole day . for each day use different signatures , as with random signatures , create unique e @-@ mails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; n File New . this gives you a lt ; empty signature ; in the signatures tab . click on the &amp; lt ; empty signature ; and add in the lower section your new signature . signature example Kon@@ qi = k@@ de@@ .org ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org When you have entered your signature , save it with C@@ tr@@ l ; S file Save or click on the disk@@ ette icon Save .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails personally or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first , then remove it in the File menu , or click on the icon with the red cross in the tool@@ bar .

everyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation knows me and how outstanding it is . if we raise it a bit , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer dependent on a terminal ; simply click the icon for the XML processor and done !
this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in the not@@ ated work@@ folder , then leave the current work folder hoo@@ ked . if not , then remove the selection of current work folders and specify the folder in the other folder &apos;s field .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time mein@@ pro@@ c is started .
as already said , anyone who has already worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is there now a great graphical interface for it .
if the opened file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is , then simply select the current working folder . if not , then select current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to an output on the screen , your file is faulty . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; then let the current file easily be checked . if not , delete the tick at present file and select the file to be checked by other file - File Cho@@ ices .

for the use of a &amp; DT@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; by definition @-@ UR@@ I ; file selection . both for the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema and for the Relax@@ NG check is the specification of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection is required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is already selected , you can select current file easily . if not , remove the selection current file and select the file to be processed using the other file choos@@ er file .
specify the file name as the result should have named . the file is normally stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; spaw@@ ned , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system becomes very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not need to wait until someone uses the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements .
to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we start editing the plug @-@ in menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all contained plu@@ gins and add new ones . we describe every &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plu@@ gins without a location , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often on a project several persons work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and Email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub@@ project leaders .
the user can select from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears to be bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of your own identity are important in terms of messages and comments . see for further information on comments .
in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing members of the team : an event for information about team leaders can be created when something specific happens . see for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later it can be seen how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is locked into the CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the side event configuration of the shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog can create , edit , and delete events .
an e @-@ mail is sent to the add@@ res@@ sees selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see may be a team or sub@@ project leader .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments through the following things :
comment entry is simple . it can either be selected the comment entry from the Editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment field followed by comment text .
notes can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) is a role in the project from the following possibilities : team Manager , sub@@ project manager After the area and sub@@ project managers , the appropriate area or sub@@ project names should be given as shown in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around the brackets are invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that supports DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only over &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for others can be found in .
the settings can be set up using Qu@@ anta settings ... To be called . this dialogue extends across some pages that are treated one after the other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags , including car completion , can be changed . entries are :
big / small @-@ case of tags : large / small @-@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal case @-@ sensitive means the tags are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / lower case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically added attributes . normal case @-@ sensitive means the attributes are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if checked , is inserted for tags for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags , except for the simple tags .
update start and end @-@ tag automatically : if enabled , the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic replacement of acc@@ ent notes : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding coding while typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ e types for det@@ ecting various types of files . using the Standard button , the default settings can be restored .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening open files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting here is ej@@ ected by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D was not detected . however , this setting here will be ej@@ ected by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates backup copies on a regular basis so that in case of a power failure or crash at the next start of the program , the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in one &apos;s own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source text at the same time .
setting the default window settings back to the next startup is useful when the user interface has been mess@@ ed up by modi@@ fying M@@ DI modes and / or app@@ ending views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ ym@@ i command line parameter .
the warning message area serves the control of the possibility to disable the display of warnings by hooks of no more questions .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source text view in shared mode . see the various modes see .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree that represents the mapping of par@@ ser no@@ des in the document can be adjusted in details .
in the mouse click on the structure tree it is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the area of structural tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the update frequency of the tree when editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree is to be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are empty spaces in the text , while empty groups are those where no element has been found in the current document .
short@@ cuts are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there may be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ clause is something else than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript .
plug @-@ ins can be managed here . plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part applications from third party , which can be re @-@ used by each K@@ Part @-@ capable application , the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not located at a booth like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
load the component in &quot; Only @-@ Read &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the inserted information is correct . des@@ elect allows to save the entry even if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , de@@ bu@@ gging has been completely re@@ designed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ u@@ gger has been dis@@ continued , as is the support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger .
currently only a plugin is available , which inserts support for using &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plu@@ gins in the project settings . with the Options button next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ user interface :
a view where the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left Do@@ ck .
a view where all holding points , with time numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger , all or part of the following functionality is available .
this action is used to connect to the de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it shares the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bug claims . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened using a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally it doesn &apos;t have to pay attention to it .
the counterpart to Deb@@ u@@ gger session Start the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or ends the listening to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to request a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ u@@ gger output .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and running information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution continues . if it happens before a de@@ bug request has begun , the script will start with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues . if it happens before a request is made , the execution begins as soon as a request is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger triggers the next statement in the script without del@@ eting into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger triggers the next statement in the script , where possible in functions and include is corrected .
instruc@@ t the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the statement and go to the next one as if it were not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work by Keith Is@@ dale and this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front @-@ end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g , which they can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many other works of Keith .
this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to your needs and how you can and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; can help to become better .
document type editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to give support for market and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; their simplicity and flexibility makes &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script language and &amp; CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and tool@@ bars . tag folders contain two file types , the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with extension .@@ tag@@ . tool bars are handy , symbolic links of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , which contain text and instructions more quickly in a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details to convert .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the property dialogue , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day displays . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool bars enable fast inser@@ tion of tags in a document without the risk of a writing error .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders carry the name of the description language and version , so there . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares if they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but a single element type .
the type of tag is a script function . when using , att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 only )
valid only for type method . specify the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 only )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( family 1 only )
set a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
this item can only occur once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of the attribute . additionally , it contains other tags that describe how to display this attribute &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
speci@@ fies the source texts for the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve the source of data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ definition , meaning the name of the current tag .
a container tag group@@ ed together elements of a list . it can only happen once for an attribute description . it is a only element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each one ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specify the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once ( e.g. one for each ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may appear within the tags to be defined . this element is a single element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a day . this item is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces do not affect anything , but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; text &gt; be replaced .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog above in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ windows to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to choose . another dialog will appear with simple instructions to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , the check is done only when the Tag@@ XML files are loaded in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in the following one example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . this can be edited by di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = shift 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D statement . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... created . click New action to create the same dialog :
the short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking on the user button , a key short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ one , the current key short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document to the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful type of action . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) , are started . examples of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even are the Quick Start dialog or the different See in ... A@@ ctions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first the name of the script and the interpreter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . This way &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is trying to find the script in the following locations : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PA@@ TH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will replace the current document URL . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name will be removed .
% p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document , or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can receive input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in the input field input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected range of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , directed to the standard output ; error messages are directed to the default output . it can be specified what is to be done with the text written to the standard output by setting the value in the output box :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . in given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the tag .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings to set actions .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
complete all necessary fields and add the tag to the matching tool@@ bar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you plan their use , enable dialog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edit Tag &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if available so that an input can be done when using the action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphi@@ cs Show other programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the start of the day , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually called loose , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ alled that clicking this icon will insert a &amp; lt ; start ; tag in the current document .
after creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action . this happens through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the application button and continue with other tags , if there are any , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be shared for a better overview by some divi@@ ders into several groups . open the tool@@ bar setting dialog via Settings tool bar . make sure the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
I would like to select the separ@@ ator ( top left ) for my tool bar . after selecting the element to add to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like to preview a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by scanning all symbols to make sure everything works .
secure in the right folder . after new e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in root folders , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust their &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their tool bar ( s ) will be loaded ( if a file is opened by the corresponding type ) .
perhaps the most worthy extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or format@@ ting language that you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how to create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory to see if someone has done that for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . we will leave the first part to you , the second we will treat here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files , e.g. PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = func@@ tions@@ 1 = tag@@ 2@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 2@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so somewhat :
documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the shaft depth ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resources files will be replaced .
for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script should display the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . by marking the function name and pressing C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your do@@ cr@@ c file and save $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / Q@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you have indicated in your do@@ cr@@ c file ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these are good and worthy to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation has been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you will not get rich but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the failed resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners , or anyone else . at different places there is an Email menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D pack@@ et ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool bar tool bar with email box , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the scrip@@ ted tree .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . to make a contribution we recommend to sign the resources for which there is a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event you have several keys , you can select one . pass the input fields in the dialog New resource ( URL preview can stay empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be up@@ loading from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload tool bar tool@@ bar , and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts .
after downloading a resource , before installation , we examine &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by examining the integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be abor@@ ted . please note the warning messages carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message will appear with the indication of the origin@@ ator of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files might be necessary in tag@@ XML format . there is a simpler way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and converting a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description to be used . then the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / j@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
doc@@ type definitions sheet : the string that should appear in ! doc@@ type day , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
fine setting of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , bring &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; can be adjusted . it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand these and full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ arise themselves with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to bring them closer to these concepts without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
global elements are available for anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . from tool@@ bars about actions everything that is marked as global is stored in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user in person .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project . simply put , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ powers the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Edi@@ ting Pan@@ e , the tree views , the carto@@ ons with information and tool@@ bars . please note , and for more information on these areas .
you can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as the current , other or all tab , relo@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right click in the editor area will lead to another context menu related to the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , edit the tags under the mouse cur@@ sor , help the word under the mouse cur@@ sor or opening the file , if the string is called a file under the mouse cur@@ sor .
at the top end of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements .
the use of tool bars is really easy . if they want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; P@@ GT ; insert the icon representing the tag . now you can insert the data for this straight @-@ added tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate , open and strip in the information on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in the presentation with file managers are available for files , project , pattern templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mou@@ sec@@ lick . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage media can be performed using the displayed contex@@ tual menu .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , an entire website , etc . all possibilities are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on the context they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work area . global templates are always available , local templates only for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you can find information about the scrip@@ ting languages available . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the information available to a script . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the information available to a script .
with this view , one displays the internal structure of the active document . by clicking an element , the cur@@ sor is set in the document to the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element , a list of commands with regard to navigation and re@@ fres@@ her of the tree opens .
this tree appears among the other tree views . with it it can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces quickly . the entry system oriented to the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation for web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can add , edit and consider project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two tab at the bottom of the window to reach useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the current document &apos;s mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts which are executed give all error messages ( if there are any ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool bars are extensively expanded and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the tool bar of the tool@@ bars is the ability to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as a compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they get a tool@@ bar in an email , they can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; files on your system . to do this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed here .
if you have trouble shooting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should ensure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the PA@@ TH in front of their bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE desktop . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML editor , developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exten@@ sible mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer confined to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML , then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
well , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; followed , in good use of free software , the idea of Why develop what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only this all possible but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to make use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ knit@@ ted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation can be increased almost every task .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and was quickly expanded to a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
for more details , see help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Se@@ quit@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , with the oldest record being removed .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
when past@@ ing from the cli@@ p@@ board there special characters are converted to &amp; HTML ; -@@ Sch@@ elling , so they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction .
converts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board into &amp; URL ; description , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily used to insert &amp; URL ; s in the anchor day .
switches off the block selection . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
goes straight to a line number . this is very useful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script issue error messages !
looking for a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of the script and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
starting and switching the problem re@@ porter at the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated as soon as one changes to the structural tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries forecasts or next , depending on the cur@@ sors position in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents are group@@ ed in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects are saved with the .@@ web@@ pr@@ j file extension .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows to copy video files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded other input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects you will find the details .
loads a tool@@ bar . these are stored in project you / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to that project .
a dialog to save your tool bar . allows you to select the type of tool bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . it only creates the name . actions must be set by settings actions ... to be added . tool bars are saved through tool bar tool@@ bars , or you &apos;ll be asked when you exit , whether you want to save the tool@@ bars .
remove a tool@@ bar from the field of view . it does not delete it from the disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team , so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
allows to upload tool bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
download a &amp; DT@@ D ; that made you or anyone else and convert to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refresh@@ ed without updating all &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global K@@ DE folder , the loading fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool bar . if the default ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu that contains the tags / actions list on this tool@@ bar in the Tags menu .
allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activating or dis@@ ables the smart inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting by tool@@ bar is denied if that day contradic@@ ts the rules at this place .
in the plu@@ gins menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the menu items listed above . click on them . if you click on an enabled plug @-@ in , it will be de@@ activated .
sel@@ ects the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available enh@@ ancements schemes depends on the kate ; version .
choose the type of line @-@ end identi@@ fier . very useful if you know people using other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D using the external application ti@@ dy .
instant switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , change@@ over may sometimes need time or cause un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the mapping mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which is equivalent to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub @-@ window . selecting a entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window .
activ@@ ates the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog will affect any application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
al@@ ig@@ ns the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of posters ; find details .
a dialog appears , in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bar , or which add and edit the sequences .
this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , since , for example , after completing the project name , the entire directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all of these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled out automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ g.@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment might be necessary .
this is the folder in which templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder in which the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to add files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change . in server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be attached . if a project is started from scratch , not hooks .
with this option all files and folders are displayed inside the main folder , and you can select an exact selection according to man@@ ure .
this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or , by removing the tick , clip out of the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard comprises three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the sub@@ window profiles or modified using the Shift + F@@ 7 short@@ cut .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders possible ) , which are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to the above , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this allows you to select the de@@ bu@@ gger . currently only Gu@@ bed is supported . more information about Gu@@ bed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in can be set using the Options button .
in the sub@@ window profiles can be uploaded ( see in ) , as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by cont@@ acting its own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can add event actions and add , change or delete events . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ determined event occurs , such as securing a file . see details .
default opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . this behavior can currently not be affected .
to open another project , choose project open ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allow the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before ex@@ iting , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , but the entries are missing and opened with ... in the right @-@ click context menu :
here different profiles can be selected . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows to remove the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button is da@@ zz@@ led to prevent removal .
the password is kept in the core memory and forgotten in the end of the program . this option is useful if frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather in@@ secure password on the disk save option is not in question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many upload profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog appears :
this is the server &apos;s name on which the files should be copied . either a full qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not need to be changed unless the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port .
depending on your anxiety threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply changing the view several files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted in the project or project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings tool bar project tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with which you have the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows adjustment of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to your own working method .
as mentioned above , tool bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus are best stack@@ able via the tool@@ bar menu . use and addition distinguish themselves . adding tool@@ bars is handled in the section Ad@@ ding Tool Bar .
the tool@@ bars and symbols can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ click on tool@@ bar ) , in which a new tool bar can be created , other actions can be removed , tool@@ bar ren@@ ame or tool@@ bars are executed , which can be specified in the dialog where you can see what actions should be visible on these or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu for an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
tool@@ bars and actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the Settings menu ... and set settings actions .. set .
templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; they can copy , move , or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in roughly the limitations that one imag@@ ines for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions outlined at the beginning of each template before use .
binary is all that is not pure text . it can be any file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are usually inserted in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) .
documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more specific documents can be created in appropriate sub@@ folders . one makes a simple sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in a corresponding way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see in for more information on the Tem@@ plate Tree .
this type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents , based on a template , but the same text area . you can include everything from a commentary on a final note to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for entire websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
design a document structure as you like ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and choose File As Tem@@ plate Save as Local Tem@@ plate .
once this has been done , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look in the template tree under project templates .
select Text in your document and click File As template to save selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily dra@@ gged with drag and drop to tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : just copy the file into a template folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as drag and drop or paste over the Con@@ quer@@ or file tree .
in the file tree or in the project file tree view you can click a folder on the right and create site template , enter a name for the template and secure it . by default , it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or a global template .
project templates enable a very targeted approach . you can pre@@ text he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically using &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window template is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / tas@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / j@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is equivalent to one of four types of containers as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder in the template table , right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led when parent attributes are inherited .
this is enabled by default and adap@@ ts for everything except the regular folders in the template view . if a root folder is set so , it would de@@ activate templates in this path unless they are explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text model . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows pre@@ defined or copied text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows for copying of content templates to a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , using the context menu ( pointing right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source editor available via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and , if necessary , turn back to the source editor where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document containing &amp; PHP , a small green symbol indicates the default of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit , it is still necessary to edit the source text editor . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first one , except that the changes are visible in both the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor and the cur@@ sor in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is active , this mode is already active , the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke will move the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , maintaining the position in the document .
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source editor is adjustable via Settings Qu@@ anta . choose V@@ PL ; View may be set between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow .
the document properties dialog is also called when a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created . this is used to reduce the manual encoding . this allows you to modify the following :
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows to change the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list . a change over the list is possible just as with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS sty@@ list by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the appropriate file .
the cur@@ sor is used as in a word processor , by moving with arrows . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves peculiar . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typing and er@@ ased using a back button or removing button .
inser@@ ting tags is made in the same way across the tool@@ bar , as in the source text editor . it is important to note that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing tags will not be removed , e.g. when an anchor day , surrounded with text inserted , must be removed any other surrounding anchor day .
some tool bars like the table wizard or the Listen @-@ Wiz@@ ard are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists tool@@ bars must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for checking style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style template can be executed .
um &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , need except &amp; k@@ de ; still libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already available for a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ;

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the complete path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without a path . file names in the same folder as the top @-@ loaded file name with relative path to the work@@ folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is for example a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following entry is possible :
in this command , one checks to a partial or entire agreement with a fores@@ age called QNA@@ ME or a specified mode name . &amp; eg ; template agrees with any QNA@@ ME containing the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNA@@ ME &quot; is extended according to the rules specified by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
this is done automatically when the first template is loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . holding points will be re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each flow .

on systems with an installed read@@ line library , you can scroll through the arrow keys on / off through the running memory of the previously executed commands .
multiple commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to give compound expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as an argument , a holding point is set in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;

there are many graphical tools to compare . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many points . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file .
the program I used showed me only the modified lines , but I could not see what exactly changed inside these lines . and there was no clu@@ e to the places where maybe only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to compare quickly text , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and paste it into one of the comparison windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ blur@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
also 3 @-@ way mer@@ ging is fully supported . this is useful when two persons work independently on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you to compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when folder mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and mim@@ ics the possibilities of today &apos;s colour monitors . if you frequently have to check co@@ de , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ s are displayed visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , you can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if someone changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different .
if all files have the same name , but are in different folders , then you can make the typing work easier by writing only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example :
file sharing folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder folder 3 folder
open dialog allows you to manually type file names , select the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . you don &apos;t need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C blank , the analysis of the differences with two files is performed .
via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons or mer@@ ging of folders is introduced . if for A a file is selected , for B and C however a folder , then use &amp; k@@ not ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders .
if mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field is active for the target and can be edited . however , it is not necessarily necessary to specify an output file immediately . you can also do this step later when saving .
the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before starting the merge / merge operation .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only compare parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in opening dialog , you don &apos;t have to select any files , you can simply close the dialog with the cancel button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
what is the idea behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , that would be a relatively big effort . you would need to create two appropriate files , load them in &amp; k@@ not , then compare them . now you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently you can &apos;t extract anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program than tri@@ mming and past@@ ing ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source pane contains the A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Every Info line has a different color . ( note that window C is optional . ) Every Info line has a different color .
the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , you see in the color which file is different . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files . that is good to see in the next section ( merge ) .
in some programming languages , where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre @-@ processor and in rare , rare cases . )
the vertical line that separates the text from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines . if the line breaks are activated , the line is dotted with broken lines .
the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the wor@@ ding output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; if you have edited the result . usually , it already contains text by automatic merge , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the sprin@@ kler buttons for the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference at the same time is a conflict that needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row is marked in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . ( this will also include a jump in the position in the windows , where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for the current area and each on the left appears a black bar .
sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic mer@@ ging or manually editing ; this is only a plac@@ eholder in the event that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marking that you may copy and paste elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflic@@ ted ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board when you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : when selecting sources ignor@@ ing the options or activating ignore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters .
navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys on the left , right , high , down , page on , page , beginning , end , C@@ tr@@ l start and C@@ tr@@ l end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs .
in the default window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the insert button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is inser@@ tion mode . )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the sum@@ m@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as explained in the mer@@ ging and edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first difference , the next / previous difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture upward / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict .
to copy the marker to the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l In@@ sert ) . if this is enabled , whatever you select is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and the manual copying is om@@ itted . be careful with this option , as you may accidentally over@@ ride the content of the cli@@ p@@ board .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use car return + line feed \ \ r \ .
the options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically and restored at the next start . ( menu Sett@@ ing@@ s- &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
select a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also displays type@@ faces with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c script . if the chosen type@@ face does not support this representation , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be displayed straight . on these systems , the pres@@ et button will automatically display an un@@ even color .
if this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the Tab@@ ul@@ ator button . otherwise , a tab@@ ul@@ ator character will be inserted .
if you press input or return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is enabled , every selection will be automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . manual copying to the cli@@ p@@ board is no longer necessary .
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used option on the operating system used .
when comparing files , trying to find all the identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white characters are not ignored . even when mer@@ ging white characters will not be ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a car return character \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , while others save only one new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the car return character may be visible , but then as a white mark . during mer@@ ging , this option must be disabled .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
search for even smaller differences . the option is activated in the default setting . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slow with very large files .
in the Automati@@ cally Advanced Mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will appear before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue .
this is useful when white characters are less important in many files . ( default is manual selection . ) That is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you only need this from time to time , then use the functions Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also concerns conflicts in numbers or comments when the options are ignored or ignore C / C + + comments .
these options are covered in the chapter to scan and perform mer@@ ging . see for details under Docum@@ entation for Directory Com@@ par@@ ison and Con@@ figuration .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , the original version will be attached to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further securing .
changing this option does not apply to the current running program . you must &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart to make the change active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is globally adjusted via the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the top setting will be used for all entries .
over the selection fields for the encoding a short notice appears , which is the local encoding . ( this can &apos;t be changed here and has for you purely informal character . )
modify the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding for saving should be used here .
if you define pre@@ processing commands , they might not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre@@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) This option allows you to set the coding of the output of pre@@ processing commands .
turn this off to supp@@ ress the emphasis of changes in white characters in text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or ignore C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available when comparing three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color @-@ coded overview column . however , sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files .
sometimes you prefer to use the space available on the screen for long lines . simply disable the less important windows . ( this option is in the Windows menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the Windows menu . )
sometimes you see the differences and then decide ab@@ rup@@ tly to merge the files . merge the current file in the merge menu even if you only compare two files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default names for the output file . ( if this feature is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre @-@ processor which meets your requirements . you can use this function , for example , to cut out disturbing parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre @-@ processing command . the output of the command will only be used for line comparison . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that exactly matches your requirements . each entry line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff @-@ results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this pre@@ processing command for line tables to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert string ( info : / c@@ vs / keywords \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you may start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre@@ processing command for line ab@@ err@@ s. sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Any character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , so virtually deleted .
sometimes you may want to perform several assignments at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the sub@@ stitu@@ tions from each other . example :
instead of used , you can also use something different such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l some details are different . where used \ \ ( and \ \ ) needed , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the preceding &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre @-@ processor are kept for display and mer@@ ging . other operations only change the data that the line @-@ line al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m looks like .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre @-@ processor , the line @-@ off pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre @-@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often program@@ mers need to edit a lot of files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ blur@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before starting ,
... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without actually performing it ,
... execute selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you just need to open folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders are merged , folder 1 will be used as the base . if no target folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ not ; Fol@@ der 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , not mer@@ ging . to start mer@@ ging , select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see further details . )
while reading the folder , you will receive a small message about the current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folders , only the files that have been compared to that point will be listed .
when scanning the folder is complete , displays &amp; k@@ not ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and folder found while scanning is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple click of the mouse .
the folder structure is normally folded up . you can open a folder by clicking on + / - or double @-@ clicking on the object or by clicking on the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions to open all sub@@ directories and open all sub@@ directories with which you can open up all folders .
when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail panel to the selected object . in such a case , the merge operation cannot be automatically selected . if the merge is started , you will be informed about any problems of this type .
as seen in the picture above , the colors of red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
in identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical . then also folders have the same color . for folders , age is irrelevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then turns yellow and later when it is old , becomes red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copying A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a file and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
the mode for syn@@ cing is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder has been specified and if the option directories are syn@@ ced . then select &amp; k@@ not ; then select the necessary action so that both folders will be identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; copied directly after mer@@ ging &amp; k@@ blur@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge ( unsure ) , then check &amp; k@@ not ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different but the same date appears , an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical .
during mer@@ ging , one file is executed after the other . it indicates the status column when mer@@ ging has been successful , and other messages when something unexpected occurred . if mer@@ ging is completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is al@@ right everywhere .
if the file @-@ comparison method is selected for Full analysis in the setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display more columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the selected entry ( file or odd ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging .
please note : if you have not specified a destination folder , C is used as the target in the three @-@ folder merge mode , B is chosen as destination for two @-@ folders and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as the destination .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check afterwards whether all entries should be in the target folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options that may be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to only merge the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if conflic@@ ting file types still exist , a message appears that points to the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the options passing through , simul@@ ating and breaking .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; performs certain actions with all entries . if manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
when you &apos;re finished with a file , select Start / continue directory merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; continue its work with the next entry .
if you click on an error , a message and detailed status information will appear . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to issue the cause of the problem . if you continue to merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , let &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before you continue to merge .
if some entries have been combined individually , you notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and do not merge them later . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered settled . only if you change the merge operation , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings menu - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory compilation with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) .
files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder can be adjusted specifically with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a default attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a preceding point marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in the default .
when the option is turned off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in the default .
for links to folders : if the option is turned off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the links will be treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that if the option contains a link on itself it would lead to an infinite loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is disabled in default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of resolved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that do not contain text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders using a slow network , it might be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
the files are considered to be identical if they are equal to size . this can be useful , for example , if the change date has been lost when copying . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
enable the synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no target folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected so that both folders are subsequently identical . the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default .
if there are differences , copying the newer file is proposed as action instead of mer@@ ging . ( this is considered uns@@ afe because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified too . you should check this in any case . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version will be renamed and will get the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension is already existing , it will be deleted without further backup . this also concerns the normal mer@@ ging of single files , not just the merge whole folder . this option is enabled in the default .
usually the folder merge view is visible at the merge of single files ; you can move the Windows divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can disable the Fol@@ der &amp; Text@@ window from the main window in the Windows menu and switch between the two views by switching between directory and text window .
you probably prefer to compare a file by double @-@ clicking . however , in the directory menu there is also a corresponding menu item . you can also merge a single file directly without first having to start the folder merge .
however , this status will be lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transpar@@ encies with the help of K@@ IO @-@ slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open files located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . you should note a few things :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. contained . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link is shown on a file or folder . then , a file is always accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or modification date . therefore , the per@@ missions or the date of change vary from the original . ( please refer to the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of the size . ) ( This is possible only for local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently the difference @-@ viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P starts with the built @-@ in difference viewer first . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part display from the context menu .
usually it requires &amp; k@@ not ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a part , it takes and k@@ not ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ not 3 ; patch program to restore the missing file .
in the kon@@ quer@@ or you can click a patch file and select from the Con@@ text menu Pre@@ view into - K@@ Diff@@ user Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part , it only supports the comparison of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; tools called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ Di@@ ff &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ Diff@@ 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already exist . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool collection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already been using GP@@ L programs for a very long time and have learned a lot by looking at the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all program@@ mers who have gone that way or are going to go that way .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script to K@@ DE . in the pres@@ et , configure is installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are first treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white mark is different , the line is treated as not identical .
the editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information is lost when the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could save this information .
the effort required was too large so far . you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger volumes of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text it is suddenly fl@@ ushed ; No sr@@ c is left ; and the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missed the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you very much !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ not ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
for a list of the latest changes , see ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ not ; -@@ distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir returns the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should have no problems with comp@@ iling . if you still have difficulties , please write to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists of them .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copies to the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift @-@ In@@ sert ) inserts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current marker .
only show differences : files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current version of the program , after changes to these options , you need to re @-@ read the Fol@@ der with the Update function . )
this also causes identical files to be copied to the target folder when mer@@ ging . if the destination folder doesn &apos;t already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in the default folder .
note the buttons to select the source with the cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed when clicking on the button .
this option is de@@ activated in the default setting . for example , under@@ statement in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays a mini preview of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work@@ tops , change their size , stop them or move them . this works in both a desktop and multiple .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ tops as well as the applications running in it . the applications can be selected and even moved to the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; moving is possible both inside a desktop and on other working surfaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries p@@ ager . if , however , to an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minim@@ ize , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and Be@@ e . the commands do the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also moved to other work surfaces .
if this field is checked , the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager will display the names of the virtual work@@ spaces .
cross this field lets you display the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of the virtual work@@ spaces . if it is crossed together with name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop .
if this field is checked , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background im &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
if this field is checked , the current programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only empty working surfaces are displayed to allow their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rect@@ angles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the windows with their standard icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N @-@ grid , as is known from P@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontal displays all virtual work@@ tops in a vertical range , which is very well suited for viewing later@@ ally on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be modified in size , view the windows as symbols or with their contents and move them outside the control bar .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set @-@ up sel@@ ector buttons ... allow the dialog to appear .
currently , this cannot be changed in the settings dialog . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ er@@ c with any text editor , such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t have write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or turn to your system administrator . in this file you must enter the key wind@@ ow@@ transparent mode and assign this value . possible values are :
as &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the k@@ de@@ base package you need a working installation of the K@@ DE basic packages .

&amp; K@@ mag ; is a screen shot . you can use &amp; K@@ mag ; to increase a part of the screen as if you read a magni@@ fying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag ;
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new functions . it is optimized for use on performance @-@ sensitive machines .
when you &amp; K@@ mag ; start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; displays the magni@@ fied area of the screen . below , this window appears as a magni@@ fying window . the image shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged section of the screen and is referred to as a selection box below .
in the default setting , &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse cur@@ sor as a mobile magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can &amp; K@@ mag ; to do this , select a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( drop@@ down mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse cur@@ sor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse cur@@ sor . please note that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default node ; / Q@@ t ; mou@@ se@@ poin@@ ter .
in the drop @-@ down mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it to the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse cur@@ sor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this is also possible with the arrow keys .
in addition , if you press the &amp; Shift , press or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the drop @-@ down window . note that the top left corner of the selection window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged photo directly to the printer , save to a file , copy to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
starts / stops the update of the display . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window is displayed . the selected range is displayed in a window .
&amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to store files , open a new window , printing , relo@@ ading ( with the button document re@@ charge in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , magni@@ fying and reduction &amp; etc ; .
K@@ mag is also known as a magni@@ fier ; it can be used as a magni@@ fier ; for this purpose , you can magni@@ fy an area of the screen as if you are using a magni@@ fying glass to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual impair@@ ment .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor holds for a while on the same spot . it is intended to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury @-@ Syndrome ) and to which every mouse @-@ click prepares pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor has been waiting for a while in the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and who each mouse click pain . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle pain that occurs when you click the mouse and helps many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also suffer from pain caused by the use of your computer . if you suffer from pain that is not done with your computer &apos;s use , you should consult a doctor if this has not yet happened .
to make it clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoiding ache that is caused when clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and , as with all the ergonomic tools , the result can be different for everyone .
using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and opens a mouse click as soon as you break the movement short .
is the smart move activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after it em@@ ulated the pressing of the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the release of the mouse button is executed . in this way , you can do the pulling with pressed mouse button .
this residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click navig@@ ates .
if Intelli@@ gent Shi@@ fting is enabled , the shooting range is activated ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button , wait before releasing the mouse button again if no moving of the mouse takes place .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking with mouse @-@ shift . if this function is activated , a slow moving forward and backward , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but can be changed later .
when the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the reaction time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select sound system and here the tab General . there is a slider to adjust sound buffer to reduce response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; launched at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available . for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there automatically .
set all settings to the values that have been set when you open the dialog . if you have already pressed the Apply button , the settings will be reset to the level after the last back of the user .
the best thing is to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first of all , using pres@@ ets . in particular , the smart move should be turned off at first . if you get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later take the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; to reduce sounds .
first of all , you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral parts of windows or places in the browser window that does not represent a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park the mouse in such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse @-@ ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse @-@ ball .
first you have to take the mouse ball out . how this happens is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . dirt and dirt can easily be scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or finger@@ nail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the intelligent move in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be interrupted by releasing the mouse button .
this happens if you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cur@@ sor in another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor on where you want to have it . however , you park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to use a keyboard . thus , accidental moving may not cause unwanted reactions . secure zones for the mouse cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the gray surfaces around the tool@@ bars and menus and the front rows of windows .
I try to work with intelligent sh@@ ove , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the smart move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very likely to mark text , copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it again or execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button .
do not use the smart move if you just start using it &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select text in the following way : press a mouse click at the end of the text area and press the Shift key while clicking the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . as a result , every time &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click away . so you know exactly when the shift time begins when intelligent moving .
um &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to be able to use the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window ; it should be installed on most system already .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and loud@@ speakers and is correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button once the mouse cur@@ sor is short . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and pain relief .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured in such a way that a pulling process will start before the mouse button is released . thus , drag and drop can also be done with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that lets silent users let their computers speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; mu@@ te users can let the computer talk for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation course sentences which are to be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) enter the command , which will be used later for the speech output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the default text@@ book . from the text passages you can choose frequently used text pas@@ sage@@ ways without typing them . the text passages can be processed naturally .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the dictionary for the word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . additionally , you can compare the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org Dictionary so that only correctly sp@@ elled words are included in the word supplement .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially includes an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in screen shot ) and a running memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in screen shot ) .
if you have correctly set up k@@ mouth , you can enter the sentences in the input field that you want to hear . any spoken phrase is attached to the tra@@ verse memory . you can choose sentences which are to be spoken again .
with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Pre@@ ferences dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog box contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , side words supplement as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Voice Output &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; input field , type the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ down box below the input field , specify the character encoding with the text to be passed on to the language generator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on to the language generator as standard input .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command for voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your language generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
with possibility to use kt@@ ron@@ d as a voice service &amp; k@@ mouth ; first , try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the other settings will be ignored on this page . the desktop @-@ language service is a standardized interface for voice output and is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . choosing this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field , after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a passage passage in the Text@@ pass@@ Script menu or in the bar for text passages .
when the selected text passage is selected , the selected text passage will be added directly to the input field . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage will initially only be entered into the input field .
with the second drop @-@ down box of the editor for text pass@@ book , you can determine if the text pass book is to be automatically stored when the editor is closed .
save the book . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text passage book will not be saved . select before saving , becomes &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass book is to be saved .
the word completion page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word completion . in the main window beside the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this drop @-@ down box , you can choose the currently used dictionary for word completion .
with the buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field and in the drop @-@ down box .
select the desired language for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the single words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org Dictionary in order to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are brought together , and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option , you create a new , empty dictionary without any entries . since &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically insert into the dictionary , you can create a dictionary with your vocabulary through time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided . in the upper part , the text passages are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name .
add actions like new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either through the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar , or via a drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the sequence of text passages or text passages by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt key .

if this menu item is crossed , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the tool@@ bar is arranged above the editing window directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool bar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is checked , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar for text passages is displayed with entries . by default , the tool@@ bar is placed directly under the tool@@ bar via the editing window . by mouse @-@ clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
you probably have not entered the command for the voice output correctly or not completely . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General Settings and enter the voice output command on the voice output voice output . ( see settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
festival is a voice @-@ over@@ ing system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wal@@ sh are supported .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the voice output command then reads :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and without further restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ eware folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be switched on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of using Free@@ T@@ TS . )
M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA , assuming Ha@@ di@@ fax and M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax is happy to send the last sign of the text so that an additional sign has to be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples :
/ usr / local / m@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / m@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line , and the option to send data as standard input must be enabled .
the voice output da@@ em@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
since the setting of the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ron@@ ts@@ d as a voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
to set up , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in &amp; k@@ mouth settings dialog , if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
around &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB of memory ( and additional memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , can let text output through the computer . a list of pre @-@ spoken pro@@ positions is stored , which the user can always re@@ write .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language syn@@ thesizer . on the computer a speech syn@@ thesizer must be installed .

&quot; &quot; &quot; before you can use &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you must install and set the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the first start of kt@@ ron@@ m@@ gr or as long as no spokes@@ persons are set up , the list of speakers is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker installed , the card tab is displayed in general .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer sp@@ ool programs for the same printer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you click on the tab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tal@@ k@@ m@@ gr &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab , the speaker card will be displayed . it will automatically appear when you start t@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear on top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not present a speaker .
with a mouse click select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse click select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse click select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list determines also their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
select a voice type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a young and girl voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost use . go back to the map general and check if voice output is enabled , so that the T@@ TS service of &amp; k@@ de ; starts . see . now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to read text . click on the car@@ sharing map to create and manage text jobs .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start the &amp; k@@ de Language Issu@@ e System . click the General tab to open this map . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to activate the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the car@@ goes card will be displayed and you can create text jobs and read it . see . remove the marking , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; gra@@ yed out .
if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is termin@@ ated , runs &amp; kt@@ ats ; next , if the field Voice Output function is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will automatically appear in the system area of the control bar , it will disappear as soon as the reading is completed .
with the buttons in this series you can start , cancel , pause and record text jobs .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board , or open a text file for reading . you can also change the speaker for an order .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings on all pages will be adopted .
the car@@ goes card orders will only appear when K@@ TT@@ SD has been started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and check voice output there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the &amp; k@@ de web browser , you can read the text of the displayed website . first check the text that should be read , and select Tools text in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should begin .
it is almost always sensible to mark the desired text of a website . you can skip this step as well , but then many &amp; HTML ; head@@ lines and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; kate ; the Advanced text editor by &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the text displayed . first check the text you want to read and select Tools text in the main menu . then the voice output should start .
this also works if &amp; kate ; it is embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the &amp; k@@ de news system that informs you about events you set up . you can also read the text of this news from &amp; kt@@ ats .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . you can set up &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; for example , set up that you will be notified when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel where your nick@@ name occurs .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu item appears in the Settings menu . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
filter for bri@@ qu@@ etting offers a good possibility in &amp; kt@@ ots ; wrong @-@ st@@ ressing or incorrect messages to correct . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml which is part of the scope of delivery is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the term / local / in@@ box , since it can be assumed in most cases as presum@@ ed .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in filters , text is processed before being sent to speech disp@@ at@@ chers . they are useful for the improvement of pron@@ unci@@ ation in order to replace mis@@ spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain defici@@ encies of speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand the working of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other jobs and holds these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the retained jobs are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will resume after the issue of warning .
news has the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you can read a long text on a web page , you can join &amp; k@@ mouth ; anyone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; messages are also news .
the rest are simple text jobs . each order you create from the car@@ sharing map is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a application that uses text jobs . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts , which do not have any particular ur@@ gency .
all four order types are executed in queu@@ es , except for the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one reads them , this output is stopped and termin@@ ated .
first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal al@@ erts , messages and text jobs as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently , there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there may be further types of filters .
bri@@ qu@@ etting parts replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be provided either as words or as regular expressions . it is provided with pre @-@ defined character chain replacement filters , which allow setting chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for converting messages from &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intelli@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert XML ; from one format to another format . included in &amp; t@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; contained in SS@@ ml .
with subscri@@ ber @-@ selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or the program , which has the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you have set a female voice on the speaker card speaker , you can read text of K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied for voice output . if the filter detects that its rules do not apply , it will continue to pass the text to the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; is sent , it is processed by all activated filters installed on the page below . the editing by the filters takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and will not be used . filters are sub@@ trac@@ ted from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and the further entries will be displayed below .
for set @-@ up filters , you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparative pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be replaced with the corresponding replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it only needs to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Re@@ place . the list is executed from top to bottom in the order shown .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter will only apply if the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here . click on the button to view a list of languages . you can also select several languages if you press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l key at the click of the mouse .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs will get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only enter copied .
the character chain replace filter is only applied to the text if all the conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter apply if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
in comparison of words , the character bri@@ qu@@ etting filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . thus , the words must be limited on both sides by dividing lines ( spaces ) .
in this manual , you will find no manual for writing regular expressions . however , if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can use it in the di@@ alogs Add or Edit as help to connect these expressions . the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package ambig@@ u@@ ls .
XML ; Trans@@ former &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from a format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such transform@@ ations . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility needs to be installed on your system .
specify the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reached via the environment variable PA@@ TH , also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
with the language selection filter , you can send text to a specific speaker set up on the speaker card or to a speaker with certain characteristics . for example , you can specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ops ; there is a text to the filter , it searches for a nar@@ rator for the text . the speaker is selected using the speaker properties that the program provides , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends it , and the characteristics of the speakers established on the cartridge board . with the speech selection filter , you can over@@ write the chosen speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions , you can call it with one click on the button to get help in typing .
to get faster processing , try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to match the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to show the dialog box sel@@ ector .
use these buttons to save or load your speech settings or to delete all settings .
the language selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice @-@ over@@ s API , by &amp; k@@ de ; enables program@@ mers to give T@@ TS capabilities to their applications . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the speech syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can be used .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the language edition API by &amp; k@@ de ; the full documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bilit@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice input services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; &amp; k@@ de interface ; from the program t@@ d to the object K@@ Jav@@ ech .
the text of the text for reading and option is a language code as &amp; eg ; s , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands , type :
open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ windows . start t@@ kt@@ d in a window , then kt@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned Voice Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Converter filter , but when using the module for festival websites , websites are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able works at all . you must do this yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the environment variable PA@@ TH .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks appear to cause mistakes in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or just chew@@ ing cat@@ fish . what can I do against it ?
first make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be fixed by a string translation filter . see .

the speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts have their own license , which you find in the accompanying documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices which have their own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can get the package t@@ weak@@ .@@ ft@@ p . &amp; kt@@ ops ; you can find the source code from ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page ht@@ t@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ d .
K@@ T@@ TS also works with any language syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; Con@@ sole .
the list of languages listed above can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , draw the description of the syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ats ; , after information that is not yet included in this manual .
the &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you would like to expand &amp; apply for the use of a different syn@@ thesizer , contact the development team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ml and for the &amp; XML conversion filter but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to compile &amp; execute , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including packages and development files for the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for dic@@ tum , or downloaded the currently created tar@@ ball every night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before using &amp; Desktop , first check if speech syn@@ thesizer works correctly with your speech syn@@ thesizer . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf to do this .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr will be developed in such a way that the set @-@ up of speech disp@@ at@@ chers is possible directly and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text will be de@@ composed into individual sentences . the user can go back sentence or sub@@ stitution , repeat , pause , or cancel the output .
if an application gives text to &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output . if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender is female , it will be used , otherwise the best suitable speaker is chosen . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ats ; select a speaker , you will see in .
if you click Add to Add to the list of speakers , and in order to add a speaker to the list , or click Edit , the cartridge speaker setup will be displayed . for example , in the following , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive is shown . for details on the modules , see below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in PA@@ TH , you only need to enter the festival .
select the character encoding for text that is passed to Festival . with voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; known , this setting will be done automatically . in general , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
these slide controls adjust the volume , speech speed , and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some knob and display this gray , the voice you choose does not allow these settings to be selected .
some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized faster ( with greater memory consumption ) .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or click Apply to Apply ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window will be displayed kt@@ m@@ gr on the start of kt@@ ron@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the symbol kt@@ ron@@ m@@ gr in the system section is visible , but not the program window . click the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ m@@ gr does not run yet , it will appear in the system area once K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . thus , you have the possibility to stop reading or otherwise control .
here all orders in the queue are listed , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the precisely edited set . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column ID on the mapping speaker .
with the buttons in this series , you can pre @-@ - or withdraw from the order listed in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other flash@@ cards ) will be adopted and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also .
here , only text jobs are listed and managed . issues of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . for more information on the types of message of &amp; kt@@ ts , please refer to .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the corresponding audio module or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can &apos;t load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speech speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200 % , about twice the normal speech speed . in order for these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click Apply to take over the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you will have to find out which device works with you . in doubt choose Standard .
on this card you can set up special actions that are executed whenever the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of speech applications :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other jobs and holds these orders . once the output of the screen reader has been read , the retained jobs are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will resume after reading the warning .
news is the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you read &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a web page , you can talk with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who just steps into space .
a text assignment is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output to the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the introduc@@ tory sound and the introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this tab only apply to normal text jobs . there are no special actions for messages , warnings and the editions of screen readers if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read K@@ not@@ fy messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click Noti@@ fications . the list menu pop@@ s up .
select this check box to add &amp; k@@ de ; Noti@@ fy Noti@@ fications . if this setting is not selected , the other settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications with which a sound is played out will not be read by &amp; kt@@ ons ; not pre @-@ read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message .

note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it is executed . otherwise , the action is executed for all other events of the particular application .
the event All noti@@ fications for the application default ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list ) . to do this , you can set the default noti@@ fications as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications to a file . use the Save button to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ml ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains trademarks for controlling voice , speech speed , volume , sex of voice and pitch . also marks for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation of voice and pitch . SS@@ ml is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; only partially and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are present :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) as this is the default voice , the festival uses the output of SS@@ ml .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 % , the SS@@ ml text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and set @-@ level detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds do not divide text into single phrases . this allows you to start / stop or pause on the first set , as only the first set can be syn@@ thes@@ ized , even if the speech syn@@ thesizer does not support this directly .
here you see the pro@@ posi@@ tional distin@@ ctions filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; as default , a set limit detection filter is set up automatically . you can change its settings or add other set limit detection filters , but beginners will get dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the easiest way to learn the selection of speakers is by trying out . turn on the choice of speakers and select text to read . change the selection of speakers , change some features and check how the speaker selection changes . of course , you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; then you can start reading faster , because only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block , which can take a long time ,
you can pause or ab@@ ort text jobs on the file card , even if the speech syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set @-@ level detection filter is automatically set up when you start t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing .
pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ positions and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator character ( decim@@ al code 8 ) at the set limits ( tab@@ ul@@ ator characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the default pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter retains the character set .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ wavel@@ ength ) , warnings , messages , or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the normal set limit detection filter by mistake , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ats .
on the menu language selection menu , you can over@@ ride the language settings for the application . the card card is displayed if
use of the standard speaker ( the top of the cartridge speaker ) . in other words , no speaker characteristics are specified .
use of the most suitable speaker , having all the characteristics of a speaking speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ t ; the speaker that best matches the originally set characteristics .
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the characteristics of the desired speaker here . if this property does not matter , do not give anything .
check this check box if the property is to take preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set several markers here .
since language is a critical factor in publishing output , it is always considered a priority property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case where you possibly want to specify the attribute language is when you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than the one in the working environment .
to use all the features in the speaker area , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the Def@@ ault Spe@@ aker select button and then use the speaker that matches the following .
in this case 0 stands for the last word order in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .

I have uploaded an additional voice for festival from the Internet . I have installed them and can use them in festival but kt@@ eh@@ m@@ gr does not display this voice .
then add the new voice in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / t@@ gru@@ b / vocals file . as a guide , you can use the other entries . if that is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; where you have found the voice , to the developers .
there is a setting speed on the audio card audio . in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be discover@@ able via the environment variable PA@@ TH . some syn@@ thesizer modules such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed on the cartridge board for speaker setup . depending on the selected voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speech speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ats ; &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ reads . ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ml ; ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; by &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ml re@@ form@@ er@@ filter , and set up the speech speed .

festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is exposed . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported .
you need to install at least one language . you will find help in the instructions provided with Festival . if you want to read web pages , you must install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . German voices are subject to restrictions on sharing .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows the administration of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ Center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ Center ; can be called by selecting K Menu _ contro@@ l@@ Center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf file ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center are displayed ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting the k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network Set@@ ting in &amp; K@@ Menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured , so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and allows setting of network features .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed and installed for the installation of &amp; Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers need to be loaded by custom@@ izing the following files , according to the kernel version :
the network settings module is loaded when the option network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index is selected . when starting the module &apos;s network settings , this attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be identified , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform to choose from the list that best matches the distribution and release date . by selecting the setting of non @-@ res@@ etting questions the setting can be dur@@ ably hit . the next start of the network settings will then automatically pres@@ et this selection .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . before , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in the system management mode , you can click the button System Administr@@ ative mode at the bottom of the module at the bottom of the module . it is required to enter the password .
in system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three tab@@ s :
the network interface tab is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the Ri@@ der Network Interface :
the settings displayed on displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button interface ... set up in the dialog box .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options .
with the automatic selection , TCP / IP settings are taken from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings for the system are simultaneously started with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at every system start , so no further setting is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , can be selected .
with the selection of manuals without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , the TCP / IP configuration can be made . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask , the sub@@ net mask must be specified .
if this option is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface during boot . if initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the &amp; console ; you can see if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . switching on an off @-@ off network device is activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
network devices can be activated or turned off as required . switch off an enabled network device by selecting from the list and de@@ activating the interface ...
speci@@ fies the host &apos;s IP address in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer calls ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS triggers this name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution part of the name resolution is a simple way to manage this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS entries can be placed in the list by selecting an entry and / or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons Hin@@ dered or Her@@ under .
by clicking on the button Add ... from the group machine for name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will display the New Name Server dialog .
first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and click Add the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; select an entry from the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Calcul@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to enter the name resolution and then click the Edit button . the Edit menu will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list Nam@@ ely known hosts describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS servers .
normally , the list Nam@@ ely known hosts contains some entries , which support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and support some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this version of IP still in the test is intended to replace version 4 in future .
enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add .... Add New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
enter the name of the familiar host and click Add the Add button . if the familiar calcul@@ ator has multiple alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a name known by name from the list and select Edit .... The Con@@ di@@ ator Con@@ st@@ ant Calcul@@ ator will be displayed .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the Network Settings module are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , the following command must be set in a &amp; Con@@ sole .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the fully compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with a graphical interface , such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended only by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given , and in the second , all of the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf configuration files will be discussed .
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC is convey@@ ed into a small ( home ) network .
IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never been widely used . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to be propag@@ ated in the near future . therefore , this description is currently focused on the common IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowing the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , at the &amp; eg ; Work@@ place , the network administrator is the contact person who is running a valid IP address or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a particular area reserved for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not rel@@ a@@ yed on the Internet , therefore their use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks addresses are mostly used in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 machines .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all computers are participants in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the default route is needed for IP for@@ warding .
the net address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
this section contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf , and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed with DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if there is a different content in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is well known that this file is sc@@ anned by the scripts in Su@@ SE . another stand than expected can therefore occur .

it appears the standard k@@ de ; dialog . if you select fl@@ aps , you can see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog .
prints the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who own advanced per@@ missions .
cr@@ on , for example , Vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command c@@ ron@@ tab to change user schedules .
a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX to experience time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape . the first thing was to create a surface for tar , which furthermore offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective packing . the second aim was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take when one sec@@ ures ?
before a tape can be used , it must be used by &amp; k@@ dat . it can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; split the tape back and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the band . recognise &amp; k@@ dat ; the pr@@ elo@@ ad on the tape not , you will be asked if the band should be format@@ ted .
recognis@@ es &amp; k@@ dat ; the pr@@ elo@@ ad , searches for the appropriate index on your plate . if this cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index is to be newly created .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the volume of the tape can now be searched by the entry of the entry for the tape .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; gives a corresponding message in the status bar by changing the symbol for the tape and shows in the status bar a corresponding message . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a tape type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; if your tape drive requires that a tape can be format@@ ted before use , it must be format@@ ted . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually require format@@ ting of tape , DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the band name and the capacity &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format@@ ting of the tape away . all data on the tape are lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use .
before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . it can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only backup this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save ...
once the backup has been initiated , the dialog will open for backup . in this dialog , you can even check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings dialog , the Save dialog appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including data rate and time remaining .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
mark the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click on one of the archives and select the menu item to check ....
once the test procedure has been started , the dialog appears for review . in this dialog , you can even check your selection and change the work folder for verification .
if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog appears to check . this dialog shows the progress of the exam process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can restore the restore , the files that should be restored must be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the files and / or sub@@ folders are restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore in the menu ....
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog appears for recovery . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for recovery .
when you confirm the settings for restoration , dialog will restart . this dialog shows the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re @-@ create the band index file based on the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can re @-@ create the index in two ways :
this will create a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder .
for all files listed under backup files , only the files contained in the same file system are backed up to the same file system as the folder . folders that are on other file systems can be stored separately in backup files . each entry is viewed by tar regardless of the others .
to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a sn@@ apshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the sn@@ apshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and created a new sn@@ apshot file for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; files have not been fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; dat ; before the tape is included , the command will load to the drive . for some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; to block the ej@@ ection in the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work for all tape drives .
if the option is enabled , when loos@@ ening the integration of &amp; k@@ dat , the band is automatically ej@@ ected . do not use this option with Flo@@ ppy @-@ Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; change the hard@@ war@@ y block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need to share the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where host name is the full name of the system on which the tape has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time in which the tape has been format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat folder .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is included .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; Viewer for System Lo@@ gs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users can quickly access information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system lays down the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users access fast access to information about problems that occur on their server . and k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , tries to provide some advanced features to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of protocol files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available , with which the protocol @-@ lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorted . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start , and k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - will open . it will not show you this , and it opens up instead of a small news window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely do not start with system administrator privileges . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the / var / log , for the normal user normally do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion or the input strings . in the default setting , the list of the log lines will be displayed automatically , so that only log lines will be displayed . in the default setting , a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns .
you can , of course , select another entry . the string of the filter search term is then matched only with the entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the System protocol , select the column process , and in the filter bar , select the name of a process , so show &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that were sent or created from this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol rows . protocol rows of the level errors are displayed with a more obvious color than protocol lines of the level indication . the colored representation of protocol rows can be switched off alignment dialog .
if you only want to show a particular process ( for example in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the process column . this can be useful , for example , if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter strip .
in addition , you can enable the option to jump to new lines in the main window context menu to view all the new additions to the protocol .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own web@@ page on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. There you will find further information about the sources of k@@ system@@ log ;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion Archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the system V In@@ it is quickly becoming the standard for the control of the program start when operating the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re@@ format .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for every system service you want to start when you start up the system or change to another run@@ time . system services do not include such things as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , but system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only launched once . such calls are made to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if you don &apos;t have much use of it . you can also make a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel searches in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first that it finds .
the default Run@@ time is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see in the starting area a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default Run@@ level 3 is 3 . if you want to change it then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab from hand and change the 3 . if you have brought something together then you come to repair it by re@@ starting the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry is a short@@ cut to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts manually from the command line as follows :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script will be called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the start argument .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; have a server running level that runs just ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; in addition , I could also have a user Run@@ time , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc .
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or any other pointing device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by moving it elsewhere . this happens only if they remove an entry from the area of available system services .
note : entries are moved when you move them to a new area . to copy them only to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select Edit or from the context menu and paste it into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action .
the sort number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you will need to edit the sort numbers of the surrounding records before attempting to add the system service again .
note : at present , there is no way to restore entries thrown in the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab@@ ul@@ ator key to activate the different work areas ( Avail@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it with tri@@ mming to the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the input button to open the Properties dialog . use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . changes to the default settings will be saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine is constantly re@@ starting . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the standard running level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; to run under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions makes configur@@ ing the proprietary alignment programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution , please check that all configuration files are present , which are required by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply termin@@ ate without notice if their configuration files are not present or false .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , may even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the running level so that they can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it &apos;s enough to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; read .
after making changes , you need to save them . either use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or the save save in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , the user and the user group list . to edit select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . it appears the user and group properties dialog .
some flash@@ cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only when you have enabled space constraints ( quota ) for users will create a flash@@ card where you can make individual settings . additional flash@@ cards may appear if Shadow Pass@@ words or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD universities .
the password management card appears if shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD universities .
this card only appears if space restriction ( quota ) is activated and initi@@ alized for at least one integrated fil@@ esystem ( disc@@ er@@ ni@@ ble at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , where the space limitations are in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current file system is selected using the field file system with limited space limitation .
the groups inform about the group belonging to the selected user . the standard group to which the user belongs can be found in the field Pri@@ m@@ aries Group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field .
the group dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , mark this user on the list .
to add a user or group , select Ad@@ ding from the user or group menu or click the appropriate add button in the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group is similar .
with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boot@@ loader , add , remove and modify the boot password , change the time up to the boot of the standard operating system , add the default operating system , remove , change , change operating systems , remove , change and more .
