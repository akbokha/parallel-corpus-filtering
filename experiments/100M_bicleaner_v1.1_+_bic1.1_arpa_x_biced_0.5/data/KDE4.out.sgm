<seg id="1">The module website can be found in & konqueror; -menu under Extras website. select from the list the source and target language of the translation.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated in place of the whole URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is only very rudimentary. Babelfish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, translations should not make important decisions, without checking the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated on the Babelfish page, where you can insert translated texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains different modules for & konqueror;. despite their small size, they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror; by making them more readily available.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information on the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual of & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, select Settings Enhancements... Open the box card tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of default setting modules from the kde; addons package. please note that if you have additional software installed, there may be more modules installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, which contains & konqueror, before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click on Tools Discharge. then you can view the page, the & konqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes when present.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module Anger filter (also called folder filtering) is available in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras address filters. with the module you can filter & konqueror; the current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Tools DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed website. as default, the display begins with the root node of the document, example: documentarian element, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory on local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; is to represent nested hierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree-Map. tree-Maps permit the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose surface is proportional to its size.</seg>
<seg id="15">With & FSView; the size is the size of a file or folder, with the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can easily be detected even if it is far down in the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView may be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX command.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treemap display is a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful colour and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched over view color mode, can either be depth for the easy recognition of the nesting depth or the mapping of another file feature such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the appropriate file or folder. for each property, you can specify if it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordinate rectangles is to be used (and therefore display errors due to restrictions in the character of the Treemap).</seg>
<seg id="19">With representation algorithms for treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. for the Treemap in & FSView; this goal is not always observed. the frame is drawn to indicate the nesting of the entries, and this frame requires space, which is no longer available to the subordinate entries. note that less space is lost for the frame, if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">Like splitting the surface of an entry for the subordinated entries, the implementation remains up to the implementation. it is always advantageous for the labeling and avoidance of space losses by means of always advantageous surfaces that rectangles are formed that are as square as possible. the best methods in this respect are lines, columns or recursive division.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimum shown area for an entry on the menu entry View on surface. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the surface of the higher-level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a lower entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally was & FSView; as a small test application and introduction to use the TreeMap widget, which was developed for the application KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The module picture gallery can be found in the & konqueror; -menu under Extras Photo Gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the gallery, a dialog box opens, with which you can define the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text box.</seg>
<seg id="26">The images per line option has a slider and a rotating panel to adjust the number of thumbnails in each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "with the check box" "" "File Name" "" "you can see if the file names are displayed in the images in the gallery." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "with the check box" "" "File size" "" "you can see if the file size is displayed in the images in the gallery." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">With the image size check box, you'll find out if the size of the images is displayed in the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the dialog folder you specify where the gallery is saved and which subfolders are to be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the file chooser Save in HTML format, specify where to save the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="32">To include subfolders with the check box, you can set the sub-folder to which level the sub-folders are included.</seg>
<seg id="33">With the check box originals, you'll find out if the original images are to be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">With the comment box check box, you can specify a comment file for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box Own color depth, you can set a different color depth for the mini thumbnails than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; -settings gives you easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; -settings can be found in & konqueror; -menu under Tools HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The media playback for the navigation area can be found in & konqueror; view menu under windows navigation area or with the shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the & konqueror navigation area; and drag the music files you want to listen to the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser detection adds a menu item in & konqueror, which allows you to change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains. this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser detection of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser, change browser detection in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the code in MSIE for sites that deny access to browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need the MSIE browser detection to call with the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use your own & HTML; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identifier of this outdated browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the default browser detection is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the menu entry... you can set the scope of the information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual.</seg>
<seg id="46">With this & konqueror; -module review your & CSS; style sheets and & HTML; -documents according to W3C recommendations and other standards.</seg>
<seg id="47">Check the module website in & konqueror; check the menu under Extras website. you can make the following exams:</seg>
<seg id="48">Using HTML & HTML, test if your & HTML document is the syntax of & HTML; matches any found fault. with this review, you can make sure that your pages are displayed correctly by all browsers.</seg>
<seg id="49">Allows you to review your & CSS style sheets which are embedded in a & HTML; - or & XHTML; -document. with valid & CSS, your web pages have a consistent appearance regardless of the browser you are using.</seg>
<seg id="50">Check linkages on your page to further instructions and incorrect connections. all links on the website are reviewed recursively.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here you set the addresses of the server for checking your & HTML; -documents and & CSS; style sheets.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and upload your photos directly to & digikam. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course, any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digicam; work together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& edited; includes fast image processing with basic image processing tools. you can use it to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the editing capabilities can easily be extended with KDE Image Plugins Interface (Manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digikam; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by libraw, DNG export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; on camera or lens, which can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs are also & digikam; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of the end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvement options.</seg>
<seg id="60">When you are in the program, your web browser will open a page in the error report system. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the error report system. all information required is already registered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project supported by a community. that is, the user and developer help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam; then we would like to encourage you to join the user mailinglist of & digikam. you can ask questions to other users of & digikam. in this mailing list however, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digikam site; visit the homepage to find news about shared versions and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to take part in & digikam; to participate, is the registration in the Developer mailing list. instructions for reporting in the Developer mailing list by & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">If you want & digikam; for the first time, you'll be asked where you want to save your images and your database. you can specify a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter the path name or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data abnk is saved. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you would like to add. & edited; will you additionally use as an Albenbibliothek. settings digicam set up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder, which contains images, as a base folder. & edited; considers any subfolder as an album. no image will be changed while browsing the folder you will see a progress indicator like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& edited; durably recursively the library path in its entirety. you can't exclude any subfolders, unless it iste in hidden folders. you can do this by inserting a dot in front of the subfolder's name.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as base folders, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have photos as symbols. you can change that by taking any photo from the album and placing it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you've configured the base folder, you can go to & digikam; set up your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and My Keywords to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw data support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, you may also handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help RohkameraBackup menu.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Roh DecoderSettings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and upload your photos directly to & digikam. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course, any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digicam; work together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. for the actual transfer to the computer the camera is often used as a disk drive. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digikam; uses the gPhoto2 program for communication with digital camera. gPhoto2 is a free, extensible software collection for digital cameras, which supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and are slow transfers over the serial port, this connection is now deprecated. & digikam; supports these cameras and carries out the transfer of images with gPhoto2. you can find a complete list of supported cameras under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support to reliably read the preview images. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you may not be able to see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things on & digikam; is how easy it is to expand its functionality through modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and gagile view. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in almost any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is essentially simpler, & digikam; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes in & digikam; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the side bars with & LMB; remove or change fullscreen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drawing and dropping images works everywhere: you can place an image in another part of the tree, over the horizontal divider line or to another application window. the only limitation is that an image can't be saved in keywords, data list, or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- A file type selection allows you to extract the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields currently displayed in the symbol view. so filtering on the filename only works if it is displayed in the symbol view. which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the AlbenSettings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The View & quot; My Albenlisteads; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos managed by & edited are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive, after the name of their collection in the Albenevolent or after the date when the album was first created. the date can be changed in the album's properties.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select album Import images. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse onto the target album and drop it there. in the then appearing menu, you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. you can also move or copy several photos in the same way. simply select all photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to input information about this collection. to access the album properties, right click on the album and select album properties in the pop-up menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album Collections: are a method to mark your albums so you can be grouped under a common name. the collection from you is used to sort your photos when you select After collection from the toolbar or view albums Up collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do so in the collections for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums after date sort.</seg>
<seg id="91">The eldest, average, new ester: these set the date to that of the oldest, the latest image or that of the album's average. to do this, first try to calculate the average of images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">If you first open an album in & edited; open the first picture in the album as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlisteads; this should help you remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album symbol, you must click the image with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu & quot; As a album preview quot; select. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digikam; supports the input of keywords for single photos in the section My Keyword list at the bottom of the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window will display the main view of your photos. when you select an album, all images in this album will be displayed in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magnifying glass buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">If you open an album for the first time, you have to wait a little while the preview images are generated.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information about each image is displayed below the associated thumbnail. what information is, you can edit them via Settings; set up. select the albums page here and adjust the preview images to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help buttons, which appear. if you leave the mouse pointer a moment over a picture. the help displays the most important features including all keywords of a photo. the screenshot above in the Introduction to the main window displays such help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures in a way that suits you. image processing displays your photos and allows you to create a number of improvements to these. you can select all the features that are with & digicam; you can choose between viewing the images, slide show or editing the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by using either F4 image Editing... or the right-click context menu of the image. edit in the edited section; image editing you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos. with image editing, you can view your photos and change them.</seg>
<seg id="102">It may happen that & edited; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the submenu of opening. to do this, and how to customize it to your needs, if your program is not listed, you will find information in & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing other image editing programs, there may be problems with the metadata contained in the picture. some programs do not store this data with you when you save the modified image. this information is lost from the EXIF and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digikam; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way is to click the thumbnail to preview and shoot. in the submenu, you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the filename of a photo, right click on preview and select F2 Rename from the context menu. note that you maintain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you want to delete a photo from & digikam, it will be moved to & kde in the trash bin. F8 Image Delete or Del Falls you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">"" "& gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt;</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the data sheet below in the date view, so that you can only show the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Tags provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. keywords are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search.</seg>
<seg id="110">When a keyword is selected, all the photos that were marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also assemble parts of the tree & quot; My keywords, so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. you can also use your keywords in other programs as well. furthermore, the keywords are re-imported when the database is lost when & edited; the images are noted.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking either on & quot; My keywords, or click on an existing keyword and then select New Keyword. if you click a new keyword, after clicking on an existing keyword, this keyword will be the keyword of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword, drag it to the desired position in the tree and place it there. then a menu appears, which gives you the possibility to postpone the keyword. a keyword can only be once in the tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and editing the keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keywords.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album symbol, select the image with the right mouse button and select as album preview in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">In order to use keywords, you first have to take your photos with keywords. this can happen in two ways: once you select the photos you want with a keyword, you can drag them to the appropriate keyword in the tree & quot; My keywords; drag and drop them. alternatively, you can also click on the thumbnails of the images and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can select a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way, you can assign a keyword to each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was made, one for the event in which it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keywords, it will be displayed in the main window under the thumbnail preview.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and remove from the menue menu. the menu only shows the keywords that were assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view shows a time-dependable histogram of the number of images per time unit. a select frame can be moved beyond this histogram. to select a time frame, just click the lower rectangle of the selection box, which indicates the time unit. thus, all associated images are displayed in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below you can enter a title and save your selection. then it appears in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all the elements of the database: names, reviews, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">If you click here, the filter will be deleted and all the pictures will be shown again. if the search found nothing, then the lamp is red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with binoculars. if you open this you get a simple search box as described above. however, you can save this search here as a live search, which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion. after you have saved it, it appears filtered in the list.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are happy with your selection, press the head OK and the search is done. the results are displayed in the View My search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection after searching again, just select the corresponding entry in the View My search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">When you select a search, the form appears to enter the search with the search information previously entered. if you select As Advanced Search, the dialog for Advanced Search appears to change your previous search. here you will find more rules for the search. for more information, see the Advanced search tool section.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search gives you an advanced search form with many search parameters, with which you can search in certain fields of & digikam; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of the search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Alben.dll. all rules are displayed by line, separated by operators. an option can be added to this list with other information about the logical operations All..., One..., No..., or At least.... furthermore, you can create Search of the Type & quot; AND NICHTquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digikam; characterizes any image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two image signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area in which you can drop every picture to find a similar. by using a grid, the result selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you slide a picture of somewhere over the symbol of the blank search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free hand colour sketch: draw a quick sketch and edited; find the matching images. also here can be set a threshold value.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive ticket search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can move with the mouse wheel or zoom or move it. move it while you press the left mouse button. push Ctrl; left mouse button to pull a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo filter. it will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geocache.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digikam; provides an illuminated table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Add to the light table from the context menu. the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window opens. if you are back in & digicam; main windows, you can quickly open the lamp with L extras.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview pane you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window and place it. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you want to synchronize preview from the toolbar and zoom or move operations on one of the pictures, then they will be compared with the other picture as well. so you can compare the same area of the two pictures.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images. if you navigate pair pairs from the toolbar, then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas for the same. use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to display it in the right-hand side. this makes it easier to work through a number of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal deletion actions also work directly from the light table as e.g. F4 file.</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumbnails in the light table. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">In the lower end of each area you will find a built-in swivel function that you can see on the crossed arrows. in order to wave the visible area of the image, you need to click it and hold the & LMB; in preview, both pictures will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zoom works just like in other views. simply use the zoom knob under the pictures or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both images when you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital stock management - away from the fashion word? digital stock management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to the final issue and the permanent storage. each of the photos is recording, scans or digital photos stores a form of digital stock management. most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up your images, find, protect, and use photos. we look at the process for digital photography the & digikam; use. we look at the download, rename, remove, convert, group, back, evaluate, sample, archive, optimize, wait and export image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital stock management takes up, indexes, categorizes, secures, seeks, transforms, assembles and exports material that has a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. as per your definition, metadata is data that provides information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you will need to find a certain photo without inventory administration. if you don't even know how many photos you have, you certainly don't use & digikam; the approach to save the metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast search and secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you care about your system is the structure of information structure unlike the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you must decide if you want to have other access to your photos, whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive, etc.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements, such as versioning photos, archiving, workflow, constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new files from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and work files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend that metadata can be saved in the file's settings page. this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which ones? added & edited; to them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. of course, these are the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, because you should assign each photo's keywords, lettering and a rating. of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. they start with the rating or the ranking. this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos during the further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's talk with keywords, keywords, as you frequently call other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import catalogued pictures from another source with embedded keywords, then & digikam; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images to the right place. changing the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dragging a subtree to another.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata overlap. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of keywords - the next section refers to lettering or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You just want to let most anyone share your photos, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. you are sure to be interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it more closely, then start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! one starts to dream of having associations, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who look at your photos, the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help him understand the motive that you have moved to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if an image is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">You can set it for a selection of images at the same time. if you export your images to web galleries, then these labels will be exported to the caption and / or the title of the web gallery system. so you don't have to tell the story a second time for publishing.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times ahead of GPS? when you had to find another city without a navigation system? was it not a boring planet before Google Earth? well, because with pictures, the train of spatial presentation is now running with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of using geolocation are already innumerable and will be deepening in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your journeys using images with geographic information.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and designates the practice to use copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information on the setup page of & digikam may be stored as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for author's line): linked to the author. this field contains the photographer's job title. examples of this can be titles such as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for vendors): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. if the photographer works for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here that you provide the picture to others.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright-sections, although they do not offer protection against misuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify this, in the image. for individuals this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per picture. & digikam; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: plate error, disk failure, electric shocks, ECC, transmission errors, ageing of the storage media, recovery, redundancy, disaster prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, distribution superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire. these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you even in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section, there are problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTrack, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">Of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece which takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable but you can reduce this risk in which you can use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors even if you have just been written. therefore, they use a control humming mechanism to protect yourself. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control humming. despite this massive protection, they age through chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a cheap program called IsoBuster that seems to work wonders for CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical Media: Blu-ray Disks seem to capture the format war against HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray disk can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Do not forget to copy the media with a description, date & author and then store them on a clean, dark dry and protected place. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Diskuss retains your statistics for yourself. your manufacturer committees include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives: disk error study</seg>
<seg id="187">Electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of failure, SMART can not detect these errors. some errors detected by SMART terminate the imminent failure. these are particularly read errors and storage counter. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the total loss due to overvoltage. of course you can also recover data loss due to a power failure, before you have secured the files, but these losses can usually be restored without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices do not constitute a lot of electric shocks, it looks different for devices with computer chips and high-speed Processors. these can cause serious damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause locked keyboards, complete data loss, hardware aging, destroyed motherboards and other defects.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against spikes is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy heat and earns the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug strip. however, remember that not every socket strip also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for overvoltage protection, please ensure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also make sure that it offers protection against lightning impact and thus protects the right connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected. some manufacturers provide overvoltage protectors that also contain a telephone line for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a wearable overvoltage protection. a large number of these devices are especially developed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection your system protects against minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in case of a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in uninterruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">Besides the protection against overvoltage, these devices can automatically provide cordless energy when a power failure occurs. this gives you the possibility to save your data and to shut down the system. some models allow them to continue working until the current runs again. if you buy a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the cost of avoiding this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can cost you up to & euro; 20. this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can mount it as a drive on & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are however very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data over the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a common backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are fed to photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want your images to be in full resolution online. the professional version will make you more available, in case of Flickr More.</seg>
<seg id="201">The web solutions are very secure from the point of view of data security. transmission errors are automatically adjusted automatically thanks to the TCP protocol, and in the large companies there is a backup and a distributed memory. therewith they are disaster-proof.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transfers are prone to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. it's rather disturbing that there should be no protection in your computer. nobody seems to have ever thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer way of data than the one in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors a year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle disk failures on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard under a license for GPL. we can only hope that it will soon be available for Linux; and Windows. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle launched its own initiative with its built-in filesystem. it is still in alpha status. it uses the same protection mechanisms used by the ZFS and is also available for & Linux; however, it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the loss of data on the notebook and 46% in the workstation systems. in case of notebooks, the share of thefts is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to lower damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no one has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most common filesystems. you can find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: untrue, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden break is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not saved completely before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings removed from fundamental physical limits. it is meant that while the technology is developing further, there is a natural barrier to this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel sensor. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is worse. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 Megapixel. even DSLR cameras have a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard disk today for 100 & euro; so do not blame anyone else for data loss. thus, 6% of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year. so, backup your data according to a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous such as reinstalling your operating system, replacing plates or resizing hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses on an external SATA drive every day. if, then one day, a flash will have you lucky if the drive was not connected at that moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget aircraft accidents: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually concern a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention always means not local storage. bring your backups up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or the like.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as already said above, a common reason for data loss despite securing panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential security: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the last differential lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. generates several snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference between files that have been really changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important pictures directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure leaves you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time, you will have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least a month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should be done manually after you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, IPTC data stored in the image file, retain ownership, memory, scalability, media, reinventing images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">In order for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years, that is approximately the time period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you must consider all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate as time passes. unfortunately, there is no other option than to forwards certain vigilance. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important for reading your images, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the professional expression for the ability to change a system in its size. this actually always means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have set the scalability with you and the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition. in * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this section and shift it to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new record was detected by the system, but do not hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollar; the new record is / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the disk in MBgt; # works with ext3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sdc # modify the size of the drive if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software that can be read, then you can create it yourself. this task is easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">It is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can store gamma- and chromaticity data for enhanced color assignment on heterogeneous platforms. the disadvantage is that it requires relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF and has a slow compression. we would like to recommend this format to you to store your images.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). it manages images in high quality but requires very large files. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG This Digital Negative file format is a royalty-free and open format format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG was developed based on the need to standardise camera formats. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are already making use of DNG and we hope to use Canon and Nikon also at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Extensible Metadata Placement quot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a label technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; which stands for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers capture it from an original of your recording, mostly in raw format. XMP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems with the link between the metadata file and the image file. however, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of mission and business models. DCMI's activities include the work on an architecture and modeling, discussion and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI workgroups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera edit, you can use this as a temporary fuse.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine-layer processing, you can use external programs. if you edit the images again with & digig; edit, then you should add the metadata again. these have been cut off from the other programs under certain circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. first export them to web galleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to edit your photos in & digikam. in the section Adding a photo to an album, you can add a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for importing images to your AlbenDatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; to use, connect it to your computer, turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on. for more information, see the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, it tries to connect with your camera. if the connection is made, a finished indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. some cameras do not display thumbnails. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for the application for each file, photos, movies, music etc. are displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need to see the camera information about each entry. with the sidebars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The metadata tab shows the internal metadata such as Exif, Manufacturer notification, GPS etc. of the image. this information is the same as the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digikam; or image processing. note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then the selection of All Download. this will load all photos from your camera into a single album in & digikam;. during the download, the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos, you can only select the desired ones with the standard Selection methods from & kde. once you have selected the photos, you can download the button download and then select the selected one.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option new is available. these images have not been downloaded from & edited by now. in this case, the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you want to download all the selected albums or download Selected ones, a dialogue with which you can select the target album in which the photos are stored. the list of existing albums is listed as normal folder. you can read the list of existing albums in the section My Albums. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK, and & digikam; loads the photos from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the photos you want, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete them all at once by using the Delete All Delete button. if you only want to delete some, you must first select them and then delete selected ones.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to restore photos that you deleted from the camera. you should check carefully if the photos were downloaded successfully in & edited; you should carefully check if the photos were successfully deleted from the camera. if you want to completely delete the camera file, you should do so via the camera system, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filenames for the photos frequently not particularly meaningful names. the file names are usually re-used after the photos from the camera are deleted. this can result in double file names if you upload photos from different recording sets to the same album. therefore, it can be useful to integrate the date and time on which the image has been taken into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for turning and mirroring the image and for data-based sub-albums. if you use this last option, a folder will automatically be created per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The first two relate to the author in the standard auto identity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the Exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option, you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you wish for a different date format than the standard format, you can use the Prefix photo% Y% H% H:% M:% S in the edit field. to do so, turn off the date & time option. for further customization, you should read the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera filename, you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters. or, in capital letters, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, edited & edited; used for a photo, is displayed below the name the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window the next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& edited; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time of recording to perform automatic rotation during shutdown. not all cameras provide this information. in the page toolbar section, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually turned on, and if your camera does not provide this information, it can be edited and edited; the photo in its original orientation. if you want to disable automatic rotation, use the Advanced button and select the Automatic Rotation in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was made available, you can use it to automatically create sub-albums in the target album. all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub-album. not all cameras provide this information.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and in this case edited and edited; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you have to switch this option. to do so, use the Advanced Button and select the option Data-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the button downloading. then select uploading. the file chooser dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files that should be uploaded. you can also select more than one file using the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, asks & edited; you, where the images should be uploaded. a folder chooser dialog for the camera appears. select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this refers to a position indicated in latitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. determining the data can be carried out by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to cartographic an area by automatic recording of the GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architects and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser with a click that displays the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digikam; users who want to locate the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, semitrailers and map references.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few that work with GPS receivers. either as a card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading of GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you must save this data in the gpx format, since this is the only format supported by the geographical assignment module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlate the data from images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux;: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the latitude or latitude or other data, then you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the characters hairy coordinates that are created, for example, maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European road maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& edited; try to give you so much control over its workflows as possible. there are many settings that change the behavior of & edited. to access these settings, you need to edit settings in the Settings menu; select Settings. the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing. you set the default behavior of & edited; note that when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardisation and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface. also in case of database synchronization, these data are written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for author's line: this field should be the professional title of the photographer. this can be designations such as a photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the car field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to indicate who works the photo. this does not have to be the author, if this is for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here as this is the image of others & quot; anbietenquot;. if the picture is a bearing photo, then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the appropriate IPTC field. this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the & digikam database; these metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported in & edited, without going lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save image labels as embedded annotations (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the labels embedded in the pictures. therefore, your labels can also be read by other image viewers.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse cursor rests in the main window over a file. depending on the option selected, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digikam; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digikam; to view, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list. each file in a & edited; album folder that will not have any of these extensions, by & digikam; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset once again by pressing the Update button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">These settings are set to the default values on this page. however, each time you open the LED, these settings are not available. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. the option & quot; In the whole image size, you should only use on fast computers. if you have one, you can get better results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can disable the toolbar when using the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or bright color in the image. these colors are specified here. in image processing this view mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma-subsampling it is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the colour information. please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression setting, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality because PNG uses a lossless algorithm. the only effect is that the image data need more time to fold and unpack. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">This option reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no effect on image quality since the Deflate algorithm works loss-free.</seg>
<seg id="299">When selecting loss-free JPEG 2000 files, you can save lossless. even if you select the lossy setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG. when this paragraph is written, metadata has not yet been supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the earlier versions of & digikam, image processing was only an image viewer for photos. currently, it is quickly becoming a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog, you can change the settings of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default is that all green pixels are equal. if the green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels in odd lines, this difference creates a grid pattern in the output. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option marks the picture a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the Automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed photos get more details in the top lights in four steps. for other cameras, this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the top-lights, so the parts of your images are burned out, because of the inability of your camera to capture the pointed-lights, as they display the setting-through white in the settings. the setting colors trigger some unusual results as they display the pointed-lights in various types of rosemary.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general do not saturate as fast as green and red. therefore, and dcraw try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the Recreconstruct option, you get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and can / should therefore be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1. this can also be done later in the editing options of the & digicam; image processing. in order to keep the time for the Demosaicing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data coming from the color-filtered image sensor, which has many cameras and which provides a matrix of color pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA Interpolation or Farming Design.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Dcraw provides you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests it looks as if AHD Interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenesis Directed) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. it creates color-barefacts on the edges. bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for colour softening, since it is performed during the pipe conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the colour information and gives instructions how to get them back. there is also LCMS and & digikam; information such as colour information can be translated from a color space in the others to enable the colors to be as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when an image is opened in image processing / color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile Folder Set here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can save all your profiles.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles You have here the option & quot; default squot; to deposit for your profiles. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your images color does not manage the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you are using. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not include color mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw Gamma does not correct for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft-Proof profile that you can emulate as your image would be returned from one device. this is very useful before you print image since your printer can have a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore very saturated. this could be done manually instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious which colour profile for them is intended for. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. so here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. obviously, this answer is inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension lets you recognize the style for the destination: F for a precise style, L for Landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image Plugin Interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image processing. by deploying this interface can & digikam; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules you want to use, and these will be loaded by & digikam. these modules appear as new entries in the main window's menu and in addition, you will find some also in the context menu of the Previews.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under settings Shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds are fine. the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off, which are displayed at the bottom end of the images while the ad is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features display a list of all supported cameras on the left side. on the right-hand side there is a button Automatic Detection, which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, switched on and in picture display mode.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you select a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera box. you must specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / wave, on which you mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digicam; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and switch it on.</seg>
<seg id="329">If you don't, you can set camera model and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the main window's cameras. if you own more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; Show images in the trash bin, you can edit the conversation between & digikam; when deleting a photo in an album. in the sections deleting a photo and deleting an album, you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be tacitly adopted by & digikam, if you use the option to apply changes in the right sidebar without any questions. otherwise, you will need to save the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display the display of the & digicam greeting video; at startup. this accelerates under certain circumstances the start process of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="334">Setting Start for new photos is forcing & editing the base folder to new or deleted albums / photos. this lengthens the start time & edited; if something was deleted from the base folder, & digikam; you, if it is to delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be edited in & edited to customize the main window to suit your taste. you can select these settings under Settings design from the toolbar. previewing the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in plain text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam, you will find more information on this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& edited; includes fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve them. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image, or by the context menu of the preview and selection of an ad / editing item.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing includes a set of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digikam. you may not be part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules, please refer to the Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the file name, current file number, magnifying factor, and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and among them the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of image processing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before using Save file or the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you might want to make a copy of your image before changing it. you can save it by saving file.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Restore menu or the button To restore image processing in the toolbar. you will then lose any change you have made on the photo since the last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every action of image processing can be undone or restored. the last action can be undone by selecting Undo or Restore editing by selecting Edit Resale from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should make use of the keyboard shortcuts, Ctrl; -Z to undo and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you click the & LMB; press the undo button or restore button in the toolbar for a moment longer, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu items, all actions in between will also be undone or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image processing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword, using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, image down, or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: automatically select the magnifying factor</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you come to the normal view in which you use the Esc key. normally, the toolbar is displayed. if you do not want to, you can select this in the Edit & Edit Settings dialog. you can view this from the editing dialog. see the section for setting up image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print image in the File menu and get the standard & kde; Print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single pictures or whole phrases. whole picture pages can be printed from your selection. you just need to select the images using the standard methods and select from the menu album Export Graphical Wizard. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">Edited & edited; main window has a sidebar on the right edge providing important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available, without the navigation arrows, also in image processing. it is displayed when one of the five tabs is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple click on the same rider that makes the sidebar appear or disappear into the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the caption view you can insert or paste inscriptions with unlimited size. note the remark below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the labels are copied into EXIF and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are changed. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on, use either the user button or simply switch to the next image, the labels will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">There is a button next to the user button. this allows you to read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searches and sortations. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate several images simultaneously, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field Urgency. the code follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used previously in this & edited session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword is dynamically adapted to the given keyword. you can limit the number of options when searching for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is a further relief when typing keywords in a series of images. if you have entered different keywords, they are saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword keyword keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword, this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection, if you want to add a sample with a keyword, please read the keyword filtering section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The side bar Keyword Filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. usually, the left sidebar is used with their album, - date, random and search views. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and discard keywords. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with catchwords. if the keyword exists already, you can simply draw it from the right sidebar and put it on the selection. then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword filter is on no keywords, which reduces the amount to three pictures. they have been selected with Ctrl + a, and then a keyword is drawn from the right word tree to the selection and stored there. a dialog box asks if this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at each start of the program. it can also be switched off under settings Different.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and realize that it should be one or more, you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry in which the database is searched. this can be an album, name, keyword, picture, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set an Advanced search over all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, just use the check box at the end of the rule and then select the Group button. the options then look as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? free space is limited to 1GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly adapted it to & digikam; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner come in a predictable deviation from the actual photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can reach that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and the colors you print or publish to those of your digital dark chamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the subject comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing workflows. in addition, you should provide you with background information about color management. in addition, you should make links with deeper information to make your own informed choices so that you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image issues are by e-mail or web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life easy for everyone, why use a different color space and have to worry about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB video limitation compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindblooms's excellent page and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to callibrise my monitor if I decided to work only in sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in the sRGB colour space or not, you must callibrise your monitor, since sRGB converts your monitor to sRGB. if you are working as sRGB colour space, then you either need to callibrate your monitor to sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, balance, Automatic distance and contrast extend from the menu Corrective Automatic correction try to make the best out of your colors. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which is best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the light intensity values over the entire image, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest spot is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or well-washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">In the same way, almost every brightness range achieves the same number of pixels. sometimes the comparison achieves very good results in enhancing the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation that causes miracles in an image or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic matching: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright boundary tones and converts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram region.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the widest possible range and a new perspective of all values in between. this is only visible with washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is slightly restricted because of a color space with 8-bits per color. if you can be too far from the original image, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your options for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by the copyright of Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu item colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image. preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original image again, click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target picture has a red marker. the Luminance of the pixel on this marker is displayed as a vertical line in histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">At the top right there is a histogram that is dynamically changed once you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit pictures, most pixels have very small luminance values. with a button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your results depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or even dim down.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. this way the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the default settings list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will see the combined result in the white balance. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Load buttons make this exactly. any setting of the white balance that you have set can be saved in a text file and reload later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button reverts all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in another photo than your original. if you save them your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image here. 8-bit coding is the widespread JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this encoding requires more disk space, computation time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images. it uses the change and allocation of color profiles. color toning can be done by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed guidance for using color profiles allows you to consult the chapter Color Management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to find in the menu under colors tone correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously and allows you to adjust your settings so that you can use it for several photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same error and you always need the same correction. in the manual for tone correction, you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure issues is the tool for gradation that you will find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">Editing & editing; tool color effects provide four color effects, a solar power effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a canister filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, also known as Sabatier, was an effect of the creation of a partially developed printing of a short flash light and then perfected the development of the image. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar system. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original image is the (1) and the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing.</seg>
<seg id="415">The name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and therefore a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make it the film of choice for nature photographers.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repetitions the strength of the neon light. in large images, the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras frequently have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon that you want to correct the colour contrast and the luminous intensity of the photos. you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the Ok button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can do a photo in poor light conditions you can get the reverse problem: one too great saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of increasing it. all changes you can perform can be viewed in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tools gradation and simple luminous strength / contrast / gamma, the tool is set to improve exposure. even if the dialog with this tool works very complicated, you will need only the area of the slider for the application described here.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. below the graph three sliders are clicked into which they can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn operation is to move the knob and take care of how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">The original and preview of the image can be viewed on the right-hand side. the preview is updated dynamically, using the image's settings. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: this selection box shows whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, linear representation is often the most useful. in images the large areas of a constant color are dominated by the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controllers: the uppermost one for the dark tones, the middle for the bright sounds and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pipettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, middle and bright sounds. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Exit values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls which can be used to interactively change the output values as in the input rate. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create a faded image as background while something else is to be seen in the background.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons you can save the set values in the file system and reload later. to do this, the Gimp Levels file is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and three colour pipettes, the input value is automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original picture is marked with (1) and the corrected picture (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">The left side displays half of the original and the target image. preview is updated dynamically depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifier channel: this box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, there are two symbols to switch between a linear and logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera, linear mode is the most useful. for images with large areas of a constant color, linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case logarithmic mode will help.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you postpone a course arrow to the right, for example the bright sounds, you can see that these bright sounds correspond to darker output tones and that the associated image pixels become darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">A red marker is shown on the preview of the original image. if you move this marker on the area you want to change, a matching line is shown on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When using this method and the three colour pipetting buttons, automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun shades. enable the colour pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option overexposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the Luminance Channel. shadow and sun shades have been set with the colour pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The & digikam channel mixer; image processing is a tool for improving colour channels or changing the color shades of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and impact. the left area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target picture has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line in the histogram will display the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you enable luminance, the image will retain the overall brightness even if you change the appropriate color components. this is particularly convenient if you also activate the option Monochrome, because the channel mixer then is THE tool to generate great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially if you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that comes from the color. farmed consists of small noise files that do not appear at the same spot in the color channel and their noise pattern in each channel looks different. if that's the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color noise first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save As and Load Buttons are used for this purpose. any mixer setting can save you for later and then load. the file format used is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been readjusted. preserve the Luminance option is enabled. the original image is shown in (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography is always fascinating because of your ability to abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step as color images can easily be converted to the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF. Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scene pictures and fits especially well with portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves Landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate lunar scenes at the time of day. thus, similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm bright and medium tones as it adds a bit of cold into the shear tones. this is very similar to the process of leaking a pressure and the redevelopment in a slay pad. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) squamafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using the & digikam; tool texture you can apply decorative textures on an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged dots or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textured effect has been applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and the modified one (2) to be seen. the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digikam; Add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping an observer's eye in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. it is a possibility to keep his attention to the image of a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. under picture frame add the module from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image. throughout the picture bordered with a colored line, niepce surround it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), edged it with a nice three-dimensional frame, ideal for a knock effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the range of values for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image that is decorated with the frame will be greater than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert easily one formatted text into an image at any place. this also goes to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text orientation, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its features as you need.</seg>
<seg id="468">"" "any setting you chose for your text can be changed until you click the" "" "OK" "" "button. once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="469">Using the & digikam; tool template you can put a template about a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image template used in image processing can be used to place templates about a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation. however, you must use the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) for the reduction of the file size of the template. if you want to add your template to & digikam; send an email in English to the editor; mailing list digikam-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you have copied the stencil files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the stencils, a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the stencil folder appears. selecting a folder updates the preview of templates automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">You can preview three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">It is centred around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you must reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Postpone this button to postpone the image lying under the template. take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image is then adjusted automatically to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces, especially in dark areas, grainy pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurred mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper. actually it sharpens no bit, it works rather psychovisually. you can use it to remove atmospheric dunst and it makes a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyright protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three as it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for customization.</seg>
<seg id="483">The same phenomenon can be observed when ink points are printed on paper. the same phenomenon can be observed when ink points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG images, camera internal sharpness has often been applied. in contrast, images in raw format must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a sharpness filter while reading the image. if you disable this, you get the control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening keystone. you can call up Correcise Field with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should do this carefully because the results are not very natural: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but increases the sharpness. in general, the most useful technique to sharpen an image can refocus the tool. you can refocus it using the menu entry Correcise. under refocus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the picture a little softly is much easier than to sharpen. use the tool to sign with the menu item Correcise softening and experiment something with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove mucus from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview will help you to edit the image. the preview window will display the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tested first. an increase of the radius or the amount enhances the effect. if you make the blurred mask too strong, noise and the impression of grenades are created near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, they should sharpen images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference-amount. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference thus for an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from the sharper and therefore avoid flaw in faces, skies and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image (2). blurred mask was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted depletion filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese Filtration. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blur mask. refocusing usually achieves better results as blurred. you can start it from the menu by refocusing the colors in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">The Gauß's fold has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pixies, which are far from the original source pixel. the FIR Viennese inverse of the Gauß's folding is influenced in most cases even very strongly from the distant pixels. it causes undesirable results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular wiring. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most pictures, the default value should yield 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in the correlation may help to reduce artefacts. the correlation may be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values are close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase of the noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. the filter can accept values of 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sharpness: this is the radius for the palate. use this parameter if your blur is' sh '. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a non-zero value, you might also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results, especially if you have selected large values for the circular sharpness or the gauge's sharpness. note, however, that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform any cutting, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you otherwise change the picture. the reason for this is that many operations are not immediately visible, but leave behind some unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the sharp masking used a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, unsharp masking must always create artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blurring. for the Vienna filter one can show that it is the optimal linear filter. practically the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blur mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better when processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of sharpening correction in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">"" "the" "" "smoote" "" "regulator sets the sharpness of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil." ""</seg>
<seg id="514">The colour ink allows for a modified color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, then you can set this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool error correction is one of the most widely developed tools to remove undesirable artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to make the restoration easier. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tabs smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail preservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to uniform smoothing over the image. whereas larger values are smoothed in homogeneous regions and details are sharp. a value of 0.9 should keep details in such a way that no sharpening should be necessary afterwards. please note that the details should always be subordinated to the direction dependency.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value close to 1 is smoothed in one direction. if you have a film granulator or CCD chips, a high value will cause wave-like patterns. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Flatten [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above alles. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: specifies how often the algorithm is gone through. normally, 1 or 2 is enough.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle-step as [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is small, you should also choose small angles. make sure that small angles create a long runtime. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral pacing range [0,1, 10]: integral stride length in pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Using linear interpolation: the higher quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal. however, it doubles the runtime. therefore, we recommend it to let it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save As and Load buttons do this exactly. any adjustment of image errors can be saved in a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and take a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button demolition.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small artefacts. the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City by an analog camera. as you can see, there is an odd black artifact in the foreground that caused by a poor film shift during the journey. the original picture is below (1) and the corrected picture is under (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digikam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyright-protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; - effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular noise that can be removed successfully with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">Here you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced Preferences window can stay with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius monitors the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and therefore smaller faults adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="536">Focus: controls the focus of the focus. this value sets the pixel pitch the filter to the front to detect luminance changes. if it is increased, noise peaks are deleted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter details will no longer be preserved and noise or smisting occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, not the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak hiss or JPEG artefacts without loosing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance intensity of the image. we recommend changing color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend changing color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically stronger, but also lubricate the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the alignment of phase jitter attenuation. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of luminance. if it is increased, edges appear smoother when it is too high. if it is at its minimum, noise and phase jitter appear on the edges. it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and load: these buttons are used exactly for that purpose. all the noise reduction parameters you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little softly is fortunately much easier to sharpen than a picture. use the tool to sign a soft sign with the menu entry Correcise softening and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digikam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This restoration provides you with the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film granulation, scratches, compression artifacts and local mistakes that appear in digital, original or subsequently digitalized pictures.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration has been developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">Save JPEG artefacts: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas far away from it. as a loss-prone compression algorithm it produces some compression & quot; arteftequot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save As and Load buttons make this exactly. each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and take a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Beading.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with uniform noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grain on the faces (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo restoration. this time, textures were reduced to an old photo taken with a scanner. you can see the scan-artefacts caused by the scanner lights and the photopaper. the original image is shown in (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">It uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are protected by copyright by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem particularly in high-quality raw-mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; light Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark-screen subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Load this file in the wizard with the button dark. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the preview window.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you connect the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the matching dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark picture will find the bad pixel. note that the wizard shows the last dark image and reloads this automatically in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview will help you to correct the result within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the adjacent pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2 dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are pulled up to compute a bi-square surface (2 dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are pulled up to compute a bi-cubic surface (2 dim) or a group of cubic bends (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the broken pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, applied. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is shown under (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & edited; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in the medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor range. instead, & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by lowering the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which makes it impossible to keep the camera by hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise adverse effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">It is possible to simulate the effect of a CenterFilter by using the large exposure range of today's film and / or grayscale depth of digital cameras and film scanners. the tool vignetting correct applies the transformation with a CenterFilter to an image. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controls, you can control the vignetting correct filter and with three further exposures of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of greatest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which is equivalent to an optical filter with aperture setting of 1, or random a luminous intensity of 2. increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image using these options.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer readjustment of the exposure of the target image, leave the values for luminescent / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digicam; image processing from the Color Gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting error applied to an image. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a light and contrast correction was also performed in the image using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & edited; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The second degree coefficient deals with the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but flattens at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth degree corrects the distant corners towards that of the second degree. if you combine these two can almost eliminate any geometrical distortion.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of distortion 2nd degree. with negative values, barrel distortion can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion 4th degree. this value works more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the 'corners' parameter has the inverted character of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resizes the image size and thus corrects the first degree of gravity. negative values increase while positive image size decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Lighten: this value adjusts brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog box shows the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are stored and used as standard values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The clay or cushion distortion should be done before all cutting or resizing changes. it is best to perform this correction first. if you want to reap a picture and then perform a ton-shaped correction, the effect would obviously be the wrong one.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal help line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to view the dotted lines. move it to an important place, such as the margin or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. subsequently, you can correct the tonne / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black vertices. you can remove them using the cutting tool in the menu Transforming cutting from image processing or using the Zoom regulator of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motifs, such as pictures from the front, frame and picture, is the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the barrel-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is shown in (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulating infrared films of the GimpGuru.org web site, which is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 infrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the preview area. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can look at the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can set two parameters for film granulation and sensitivity to film (ISO). enable the fot film granulation option if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO knob changes the amount of film grain and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes colour channels to reproduce infrared films, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos, as the colour information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a type of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digikam; filter film grain is an easy-to-use tool for producing film grain on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, manufacturers mix large silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift into the past. the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street-photographic, grainy image especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the controller, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the movie gradation effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that processed (2). the used film sensitivity is ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digikam; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright-protected algorithm from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digikam; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. nature pictures and still lifes are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the upper selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. smooths controls the smoothness or, viewed from the other side, the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with (1) and the processing is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and smoote 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digikam; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a cabbage. images whose gradient are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch you. these would be good pictures to start with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob chooses the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothness).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digikam; filter engravings shape your image in 3-D, as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digikam; filter engraving is a fast tool to give your images back with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure in which color is not the most important thing in the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monstrous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the edited image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and make it look as if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the wave blocks 1, the image is distorted with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the knob to exit.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Impairing: blurring the image along a star shaped line. this simulates the blurring a zoomatic camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often used in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurring the image by turning the pixels by a center. this simulates the blur of a turning camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blur: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Blurred vision: blurring the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: photographed from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">This creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton Effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shaking: blurring the image through random shifting of the pixels and thus simulates the blurring of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: finds the paint pool in the picture and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photo into rectangular cells and creates it, through filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Beading.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your image. this gives it natural your pictures a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. as the droplet size does not grow automatically with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fissies changes the optical effect of the drops on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digikam; image processing to hold a range free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, for example a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free from raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image (2) suggests a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it in the right direction by mirroring or turning. the tools for this can be found in the Transformer Turning or Transforming menu.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo blisters is definitely one of the most developed tools to increase a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is, how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom in an image when the limits of the resolution are reached? how can you retrieve or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select to change size change in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The size change tool uses a linear interpolation method to approximate pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool for inflating.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation to increase an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflated was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in the New Size Rider and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Preserve aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image is retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. each stallation for photo magnification can be saved as a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Inflating photo is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time and take a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Beading.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of picture bubbles by enlarging a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). preview (2) is the result of the linear standard enlargement to compare.</seg>
<seg id="640">The editing of a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture. to cut a photo you just need to create the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle, you will see this rectangle as you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button, the area of the photo will be cut away. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by drawing at the corners of the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with cutting, use the button The cutting button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file Save and save file under the File menu to save the newly cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog will be retained.</seg>
<seg id="644">According to the aspect ratio, you can specify orientation as a high-format or cross-format. in the portrait aspect, the greater value of the height and the cross-format of the width is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool Folding the aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you are using centimeters, inches or any other physical size. you can, for example, see a list of traditional sizes for photographic paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog, you can set the area to cut to the maximum possible, depending on the selected ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">When you use the edit tool the next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on the orientation. the modified image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the combination aid make it possible to hide help so that you can put your pictures together better. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious Triangle: harmonic partitions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third rule, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle in similar harmonious triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden Center: the golden middle is a division that focuses on different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden partition is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who designed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where each number is equal to the sum of their two preceding numbers.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden centre provides more liquid auxiliary lines when assembling a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">In comparison to the third rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition guides the gaze of the observer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow in this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. there should be something that distracts the eye into the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects. this can simply be there without guiding the eye, it will carry out its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles also divert from the golden spiral discussed above. your vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not the same angled triangles. diagonals on these lines can be released a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal options mirror and mirror vertical mirrors to mirror the harmonic partitions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the Color button, you can set the color of the guides. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the relief lines can be invisible. in this way, you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it happens that you don't keep the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated at an angle. you can fix this with the editing and the tool free rotation. select to transform free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your picture with the slide angle. the values on this slide are indicated in degrees. with the preset button, you can set the slider to 0 degrees. preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the upper right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the free rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after you move it over an important point of the image you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair this is to use the function Transforming cutting from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is the Automatically cropping function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the picture a bit after rotation. however, note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed at a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview is then automatically recomputed. on the right side of the dialog, you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty spaces created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty spaces created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left at the top: indicates the current angle in degrees on the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right top: indicates the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: indicates the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: indicates the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image gets a little greased. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments create a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transforming Zubexes from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The scaling tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite. a horizontal scaling, for example, will shift the upper part of the picture to the right and the lower part to the left. this is not rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module via Transformer Scissors.</seg>
<seg id="679">Use your image by using the horizontal angle and the verticals angle. if you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target picture will be displayed on the right of the preview area.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the shearing tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the scaling, the picture gets blurred. for a single scaling, this effect is usually negligible, but two alloys are double as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the scaling, the image has triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transformation and cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digikam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, by the way these libraries are compiled. in most distributions, you will be able to edit a large number of image formats.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to provide a list of all file formats available on your system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>
<seg id="685">& edited; shows only files in formats that are familiar. this is done using the file extension and a comparison of those with a pre-defined list. if the extension is listed in the list, you can edit the file in the editing pane. you can change this list of file extensions editing & editing. see Configuration section for more information.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & edited; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression processes to digital images. redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smoother results than JPEG with the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also store lossless if specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw format, read Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English. you can convert raw format pictures in JPEG or TIFF to & digikam.</seg>

<seg id="700">Many tools you need the photo editing are in & digikam; their description follows here.</seg>
<seg id="701">All image processing tools such as sharpening, molluscs, noise reduction, refocus, blur mask, & etc;. use a uniform dialogue type that shows the effect in preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below, you can see & quot; texture quot; in this dialog:</seg>

<seg id="711">The sidebar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self-explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>
<seg id="712">Photo properties: displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos. these data originate from the EXIF data when they are available.</seg>
<seg id="713">This tab provides an intuitive ticket search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can move with the mouse wheel or zoom or move it. move it while you press the left mouse button. push Ctrl; left mouse button to pull a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="714">& kcoloredit; is an editor for pallet files. the application can be used to edit color palettes and to select and naming colors.</seg>
<seg id="715">The Palettes files that are installed by & kde can either be used for the entire system or only one user. in the latter case, they are in your personal folder for & kde; -settings and hot custom colors and last used colors.</seg>
<seg id="716">In the dialog box, you can select from a list of installed pallets or search the folder by files.</seg>
<seg id="717">The cursor is displayed in the palette view as a line. it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color.</seg>
<seg id="718">It shows the color next to it. the color is described below the pallet view. here, the color name can also be changed.</seg>
<seg id="719">It can also be used to select. to create such a selection, click on the area next to a color to move the cursor there. then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="720">If the check box Beim Cursor is activated under the button Add color, the color is inserted from the color panel at the cursor. the color is either inserted or overwritten another; depending on whether the mode overwrite has been selected.</seg>
<seg id="721">A selection that was created as described in the last section, can be used together with the actions Copy, Cut and Paste.</seg>
<seg id="722">& kcoloredit; uses the following format for data in the clipboard: for each color three values for the portions of red, green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line-end sign, if another color follows. if there are three figures in the clipboard, these can be inserted as one color in & kcoloredit;</seg>
<seg id="723">The colors in the palette and the output of the color selector can be dragged with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="725">& kgraphical viewer; is a KDE program used to view & graphviz; -dot; -programs are free layout programs. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. so far there was no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphene. the programs, the & graphviz; contains, according to the program author outdated & X11; - or & tcltk; -programs with just a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kamma viewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraphical viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -programs are free layout programs. & kamma viewer; displays graphene with all possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; at. it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration into & POS; and & konqueror; (so that a change in the graph in & kate; re-calculates the graphene and in & kscreen viewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graphs in & kate; to open or to open the graph in & kamma viewer; in a & kate; Component</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems with about 1000 knots and a hack to represent more than these knot)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further required software: & kamma viewer; is a & kde; program, which requires the & graphviz; -tool & dot; for the representation of graphs. needed are in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graph, each in its own subwindow. initially, when you start & kscreen; without launching an argument, the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the icon file and the (empty) list of Recently opened files. click the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot; -files, the main window looks like in the lower screen shot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the canvas. you can select a fixed position of this overview using the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (up and down without special keys, left and right at pressed & old; key);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded file is modified by another program, the following window will appear:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph is to be recharged or whether you want to ignore the change. & kamma viewer; can also remember your decision so that later it will be done. if you want to change your decision later, you can use the menu item settings kscreen; set up... use, see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you want to open a Graphendatei outside an ongoing & kamma viewer; instance open, & eg; in the file browser or on the command line, you can choose whether you want to open a new & kamma viewer; instance, or display the graphene to be loaded in a subwindow of the already running instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but it can also be changed with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">When you start the program, you can open all graphs of your last session. again, you can save your choice both as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph should be split into several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen.</seg>
<seg id="743">When you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page should be adapted to this page. the aspect ratio is ignored. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a number distributed on several pages without a headline and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Renewable Store page gives you the ability to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive, & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (reload or ignore changes) or ask for the program every time.</seg>
<seg id="746">You can specify a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the already running session) or specify that each time is requested.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management page gives you the possibility to specify the start behaviour of & kamma viewer; you can specify a default behavior (open or not open the files of the last session or not) or to be asked at each start of the session.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which normally appears at a click in the main window with the & RMBn, opens up further possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose among different & graphviz; layout algorithms. the entries, as described on the & graphviz website, are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; algorithm, the standard for directed graphs. it produces hierarchical or layered representations of directional graphs. the algorithm sets the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then attempts to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge crossings as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for ungeried graphs. it produces images according to the springboard model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & fdp; algorithm generates a springloaded model for ungeried graphs. it uses the Frudenman Reingold heuristics, and contains a multi-grid trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm arranges the nodes in a circle in line with the description of Six and Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for specific diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command, which is then executed by a shell. the command should accept the graph file as parameter, and display the calculated layout of the graph according to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command you can give & eg; den & graphviz; -algorithms to change the graph with a filter before drawing.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of graph (directed or executed) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directional, & neato; for ungeried graphs).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is enabled, the overview is displayed if necessary. otherwise it will not appear and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>
<seg id="757">Shows the What is the -mouse pointer. click on a & GUI; element to get more help with this element (if available).</seg>

<seg id="772">Reading the KIPI module images provides tools to read and save images.</seg>
<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: uses the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the Sane project or another source such as Video Streams. to make this work you have to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the images scanning the menu item, a dialog appears, which lets you choose between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to get the picture. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window appears by replacing the default values ducrhe's own to select your image. look at the preview and adjust the area to suit your needs before you scan the image using the scanning button. the estimated file size will be displayed in the right, lower corner. in the Kooka manual you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure the window will be displayed completely, as some settings may not be displayed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have pressed the scan button you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to specify the options of the target image appears. please remember that the type BMP does not compressed and therefore creates very large files. you must also select the folder & # 160; select or create by saving the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">Screen shots can be created after selecting import &gt; screen shot in the menu. a window appears in which you can set the different screen photomodi:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all of your program windows are selected, the calling program will disappear, so you can see other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workspace. if you have selected the complete Desktop, only the window will be read under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts. if you need to switch to other worktops, you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screenshot has been made, the dialog box appears with the options described above.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. with Flickr it is possible to send photos to people that are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world, show the photos of your camera online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The module Exporting to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a flickr server on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time you will be guided through the process of generating a token. this is used for your authentication. so it is virtually your identification to Flickr. a browser is started so that you can log in to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful registration, the module can send photos to Flickr's website. you will be presented the following page after a successful registration.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after you've pressed Yes, you get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module exporting to Flickr for two times, you will be welcomed with the following dialog, which displays the current access rights the module displays. to upload, you need write permissions. the module does not currently support any other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue using these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button Add images should be pressed once you have set all the other options. with this button, you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. if you press the Ok button, start uploading the photos to Flickr server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The key field can be filled with a comma separated list of words. these are added to the image as keywords during loading.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the options Open, Friends and Familly, you can set the permissions to your images. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you select the option Modify the size of the photos before uploading, the photos before uploading are changed in size. size is taken from the value registered at maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server.</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data are stored in the EXIF keyword of the image and the localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization provides tools to locate images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical location Korrelator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and go to the menu. the above-looking dialog appears then. to create a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data that were taken at the same places at the same time as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded an automatic correlation is carried out which indicates coordinates in red. GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera side must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the timezone. set your camera zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time variance gives an upper variance for the GPS time and camera side. if the deviation below is merged, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have trace data from one place for images, you can manually edit the gpx file and add it to the pictures. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you have no matching data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlated to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place. since the dialog is the coordinates of one call to the next, you just need to use the button OK to place the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. select the region and increase sie.Run it again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be changed manually. the map can be changed between card mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Complete outside the KIPI module there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exifttool to provide a pile of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module picture gallery is a tool for exporting a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 in order to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The panel selection allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML. you only need to select these albums. the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the Albenvorschau and the text that appear in the head of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The Appearance tab defines general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. the option For each image creates a page creates a gallery in which each image will also display its own page. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow, displayed</seg>
<seg id="825">The Rider Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all your images. select a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you select the JPEG format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth, you can change the default color depth. naturally, it also influences the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The rider thumbnail allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album Reiter for thumbnails, these are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window displays the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be automatically closed. therefore, you can read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during the creation. the web browser is automatically launched at the end to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool for viewing images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rotations, zooming, or shifting on them. the viewer can be used with short commands and buttons. it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After startup, a picture will be displayed in full screen mode. this can be changed in a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossfree module is a tool to change pictures without compromising your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of loss-free storage is that the file size increases, since no compression of the colour information takes place. for example, this is also found in the PNG file format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI digital camera client is a tool for you to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org mailing list of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the import function. this then opens the file chooser dialog with which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write to any target format. JPEG is supported while writing. please look exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Encoder module is a tool to convert a number of pictures into a MPEG video in form of a slide.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Encoder module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the packages Mjpegtools and ImageMagick. between the individual images you can add a basic image transition. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV file.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the chosen video format. additionally, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. finally, you can use the K3b program to burn the medium.</seg>
<seg id="845">You first need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG Diaschau. after that, you can create the module via Tools MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The pictures selected by you are then listed in the portfolio under image files. there you can also change the content of the images or the content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are happy with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to replay the file on a TV, you must select the appropriate TV Standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds that an image is displayed. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value creates very sudden, a high contrast very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should let it black. you can set the name and path of the generated file under the name of the mpeg-output file. if possible, keep the extension mpg.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adapted all settings to your wishes, you can start coding the creation of the movie with the button Encoding. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now quickly or easily drink a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that you are missing Kodiers or tools, you can customize the paths to the programs of the Mjpegtools and ImageMagick Packages using the Settings button below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print wizard allows you to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g: useful to improve or print directly with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import or convert your images stored in the RAW format in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from him is: do not expect dcraw to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to convert and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window then appears in the mode for a single image. with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-color RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch does not have any effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are happy with preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all information in your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to edit your images frequently or otherwise continue using them, you should not choose JPEG format since it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is included in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion using the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use abort.</seg>
<seg id="863">The batch processing mode allows you to convert several images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which is the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, you have the possibility to overwrite existing file automatically. this is helpful if they have been created in an earlier attempt. however, previewing is not available. the progress bar displays how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in one album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all pictures of an album. you can set the prefix, the number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images from an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can make the image smaller or enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): resizing in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option, for example, to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not Proportional: not proportional scale in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-press: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo apiece. the target image, including background size, border size and background color, is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the images -window will be displayed with the pictures you have selected. you can add more pictures using a file chooser dialog. for the last selected image, you will see a preview on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop pictures to the picture list and then add them to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button Add images, the selected images will be removed from the list of images sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images, you can open the new message window of your e-mail client with the button OK. you just have to add the addresses and subject. the pictures selected by you are already attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Don't mind sending too many pictures at once. most email accounts have limitations to the size of emails sent. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending images. your configuration is stored and used every time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must install the GMail agent on your computer before. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in a attached file, the comments are added to the images in a text file and added to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the images File Format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend you the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG under images file format and the original files are in JPEG format, the original Exifdata will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is completed, the window will not be automatically closed to allow you to view the status messages, searching for errors. your e-mail program will, however, automatically be started.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the Advanced Diashau module, a window with questions like you want to show your slide show appears. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL-Transitions option in the presentation enables very elegant image transitions using OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The file name option indicates that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">"" "the" "" "loop" "" "option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an infinite loop. you can then manually break with Esc." ""</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly select ensures that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not used the order of the images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The distance between the images can be set between the images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect. so you should test it before presenting your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can select. randomly, each transition between the images chooses a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to switch on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the bottom of the screen you can see the current file name, the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">If you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with comments, you can interact with & kPhotoAlbum; through these browsers, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the image, there are now entries in each group, i.e. in persons, places and in the group keywords entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your images and videos with notes. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current preview images. in the following each is described for each other.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you click on people with the mouse, the view of the browser will change. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the images on which both persons are visible. through this selection method, you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images on a few individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the persons, places and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images of your area of activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same icon in front of her name. you can save with & cphotoalbum; however, for each person an own thumbnail, This also applies to places, keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the names, select the button located on the right of the toolbar. in the pop-up context menu, you can select which view you want to use for each category. this has the advantage that you can display icons with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must choose which image to display for each individual. to do this, you need to open the image-View window (described in more detail) and display the entry categories editor in the context menu. here you can select the image for the corresponding person. in the View window you can adjust the magnifying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you call the search in the main window, a dialog appears, which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog once more.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string into the caption or description field, the captions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to which you want to be searched; the date may be either a part of the total file, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom of the window you can search all the pictures by specific names as you can see in the picture. here is illustrated by images on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you don't like to read manuals, but rather want to try the same features, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the home page of & kphotoalbum; and take a look at the quick entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start and photoalbum; and in the first dialog, select the demo, if you can launch or photoalbum; for the first time, or select from the menu Help the menu entry cphotoalbum; demo. thereupon some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum; try.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you can find it on the website of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document for downloading.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this list shows you date statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different time units. each bar then displays another unit. you can change between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. in the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying the bar only 10 minutes sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The time bar can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image of that date will be shown in the preview page) and the timeline will always display the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in the preview list.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a section of the timeline by holding the mouse button and moving the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data. if you select an area, only images of this period will be displayed in the preview list. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a timeline bar.</seg>
<seg id="917">& cphotoalbum; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your images. one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other is available as a module (see). in the following part of the user manual is described in & kphotoalbum; integrated version that you can create via the menu File HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and target. in the following each area is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the title and a description that will contain the HTML file later. on cphotoalbum; HTML example pages see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select if a & kphotoalbum; -export file is to be created which is to be seen on the overview page. you can find more information about the export files in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid information that is obvious to the viewer without a description. for example, that all images are of a party. note that & cphotoalbum; currently all images are exported. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can determine how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why they are not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images. thus, those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 cannot download images, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you set. so it can search your images with low resolution, leading to a lower transmission time. if you want to get a picture larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, place the different folders and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder in which all your images are saved. this folder will be saved and added automatically next time. this allows you to select either a folder or a KDE support protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can verify that they are all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages have been created will start. the URL you specify here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them there. so that the import function, see, correctly you need to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings you just described have all three related to base folders or URLs. in them, a subfolder will be created, whose name you specify in output folders.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or anywhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; you may want to share your pictures with them. however, if you have already spent a lot of time on it, you will need to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="932">Mit & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others to your database.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file, or if the file is only a link to images. the advantage of storing all images in the file is that you can attach all the images and pass this file as independent. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file directly from the File Export menu... or along with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are in the file of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, then the images of the URL that you have specified when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting pictures is described, which you can view over the File Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. there are three choices available:</seg>
<seg id="938">If you wish to copy Manuell to the .kim file, you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically near the .kim file copy and photoalbum; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. because most of the images have already been compressed with JPEG, and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth compressing the files. if you want to do so, simply select the Export File option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option on this page is to limit maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you may not want to send the pictures in full size because the .kim file would otherwise be very big. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">When you select a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the File menu File menu, & kPhotoAlbum; import the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for importing consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, then, in which folders the import images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category Persons of the file to be imported (if you are a Dane) while this category is in your database. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialog box, which categories of the file to import are to be imported, and which categories they correspond to in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the file to be imported, using the categories of your current database. for example, see the image.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view images: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups & mdash; if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your boyfriend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will go through the various steps from (1) Set the information about your images, via (2) the browsing and viewing, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program to manage your pictures. however, it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but often this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& cphotoalbum; stores all its information in the index.xml file in the uppermost folder of your images. it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in the CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& cphotoalbum; notices the folder in which your images are stored and will automatically re-use them on future starts. if you would like to read another database in & kphotoalbum; you can start and photoalbum; with the -c option. for example: cphotoalbum -c ~ / company / pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry settings photoalbum; set up... you will get to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual, the different settings are explained.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the left, you can see six different symbols with which you can view settings of previewing and options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can access by pressing a button on the F1 key and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can define different properties for each image, e.g. persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">View the dialog that is used to edit existing groups. for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section Sub-categories have already been mentioned. in Dialog Options, you can set up complete member groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group, rather than all groups of a group as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the left part of the window you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window you will find a list with the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& cphotoalbum; shares his modular system with other graphics applications, such as digikam and gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image Plugin Interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed via the modules. the modules can and will not be described in this manual because they are not part of & cphotoalbum; they are but sold separately. most modules however have a help page that you can access via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Because the modules are used by multiple applications together, it may be that the modules were tested with & kphotoalbum; therefore, you should always test new modules first with the demo database before using them on your own pictures The & kPhotoalbum; demo database you can either use the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu Help. do not say I wouldn't have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules over KIPI share in common are very different, which can be that some modules with & kphotoalbum; do not work. this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & photoalbum; and other applications, which also use KIPI, is that the other applications impose their images in albums: an album is simply a folder. even if & cphotoalbum; this kind of order is not supported, it simulates the order for albums for some modules so that you can use the functions with & kPhotoAlbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Here you can see the current album, which is just the current view, so all the pictures that you see at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album, the modules also have to pass a list of albums. here is a review of the album, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kPhotoAlbum; s Browser shows the contents of a category, for example all persons, then each entry in this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you specified in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category Persons, you will do & kPhotoalbum; so do so, so if you would have selected people for the view and pass on it to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & cphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. to do so, start the settings dialog and select modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to from any other KDE application, you can see a toolbar at the top of the toolbar. under the toolbar you will see the window that you can browse your image database. currently, there is not much information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to see each image with notes. this includes information about the persons depicted on the image, where the image has been taken, etc. you can use any picture either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if for example on all pictures Jesper is shown and all pictures taken in Copenhagen are recorded.</seg>
<seg id="970">All of these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want, you can see these comments if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view of three lists with a text box, you can define persons, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & cphotoalbum; since you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on shifting the images within the list: if you have a family party for example and shown on all 50 images the same 5-10 persons, you can, thereby, that the names used are moved upwards, the persons find and assign to persons faster.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the icon for sorting by date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each image individually, you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images with notes. in this case, simply click on the front and back buttons, which are located at the top right of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have taken several images, e.g. with the same person, then it may be more convenient to mark all of these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as a supergroup. to show you that it is a supergroup, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the Comment dialog, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory. in addition, you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it in order to add it to a subcategory of this entry. note that this requires you to sort your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the note dialog by clicking and moving the bars that form the top of the frame. you can also make your own window from a frame by dragging it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs, that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the button Options... which offers you, among other things, the possibility to save the current setup and look of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely fade out a frame. if you want to see this window again later, use the button Options... and then hide / hide windows. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in the browser, you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images, or all images if you have not set a filter. an example for this can be seen here. you can configure the size of thumbnails, by simply drag down the mouse with the middle mouse button, configure. just try it.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop an image on the background of your desktop, this image is set as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, it will be displayed in the picture viewer. if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the preview window. simply select the images you want to delete and press either the delete button or select Edit Select in the Edit menu. now the window you can see in the picture will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kPhotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use with & kPhotoalbum; you can also use pictures without having saved them on the hard drive. of course, you must have saved the images somewhere, thus & kPhotoalbum; you can view the view from & kPhotoalbum; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures in which the right upper corner is truncated are not stored on the hard drive. for example, for the pictures 5-9 the thumbnails are present, so & kPhotoalbum; you can view the preview of these images. however, you can also not view these images with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this function requires that you copy files from the folders and copy them back again. so, if you want to avoid annoyance, how to avoid the confusion of your images, please buy a larger hard drive to save all images.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the View menu you will find a sub-menu with the name Privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that the end is the ones you want to make inaccessible to others and click Recent View in the Privacy Settings menu. alternatively, you can also select all the pictures that your little sister may see, and unlock everything except the current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This allows you to specify which images should be hidden in the case of the case. if you give your laptop to your small sister, simply select the menu item to lock pictures, so all the images you have locked will be hidden. if you want to see the images again, click Clock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that must be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select Password in the Privacy Settings menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please keep in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, anyone who can access the file index.xml can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only for those who are using & photoalbum; not very familiar to forbid the look at private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you spend all your pictures with & photoalbum; manage and spend hours on hours with it is natural that you want to look at them at some point. for this reason & cphotoalbum; via an image _ and video viewer. you can start from preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer in the picture. of course he shows the picture, but additional all the information you have to enter through the picture, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the info box on the upper part of the picture you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and go somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information should be displayed. all these options are available after right-clicking on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the InfoBox are underlined. if you click here the browser, see, matching entries to this display. so, if you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have uploaded several images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the image up and down the image. you can jump to the first and last image with trombone and end. these functions can also be accessed from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several images are loaded in the viewer, you can let them run as slide show. then you can control a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer of & kphotoalbum; is it possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can enter the image and zoom out. to zoom in, you can simply drag a rectangle with the mouse. with the Minus button, you can zoom out again The plus key zoomizes in the middle of the image. shows as a zoom rectangle is selected and shows the result of the zoom.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button, you can reset your zoom, so that the image will not be zoomed. with the control button zooms, so that each pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work in videos that come in and zoom out with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the revolving functions from the context menu, you can rotate the image. this does not work with videos. you can make comments to the current image with the menu item comments from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the image. in that moment you can open the view and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter these names. you may prefer to select only the image and view more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you watch one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to provide images with features while you look at them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking the corresponding letter. in the picture you see a picture where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set the features on your images, you can see them in your browser. so, if you print, print or whatever you have selected, you simply click on annotations. this is described in detail. after that, you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and especially features can be displayed in preview. if you show categories in the preview view, you can add features to the pictures by simply press the characters for the feature after the image was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case allows you & kphotoalbum; paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not saved with the image but in the database. in this way, you can reverse your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">You can see a picture on which it was painted. to switch on the painting mode of & kphotoalbum, select View on the image from the context menu. to end the painting, just press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; to work, you must have the application of the program & Povray; not fully control, but the documentation to & Povray; should you absolutely have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire mode views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time, but not the object of an object that is already selected, since all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar, or select a menu item in the menu item.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are multiple possible positions, the following drop-down menu will be displayed to enable you to choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With deleting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right-click context menu, you can remove selected objects from the scene before.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to Apply these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can rectify the input errors and then click Apply or discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; -User documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property tab.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Preview in the tagged image and a small example of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render a part of the texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), cross local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screen shot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen the checkpoints disappear and a small cross appears in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object as a wire model has a visibility step. you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the higher-level object or as absolute value. objects are only displayed when they are selected, or their visibility is smaller or equal to the level of view selected in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window ordering or if you need another arrangement, you can set it as you like. you can also store multiple shutters and simply switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window over or below one view, drag the passer to the top or bottom edge of a view. a rectangle then points to the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the starter to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to place multiple views on top of each other, drag the starter in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between views by clicking on the map tab at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to view a view from the anchorage, drag the passer on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the chamfer bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view click on the small cross in the fascia bar. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu, you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them in any place.</seg>
<seg id="1034">You can save the current window view with the View window ordering... saving it. a dialog appears where you can save the window ordering under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g to render, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 topical. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene click on Rendering the Rendering icon in the toolbar or select the menu entry view scene render.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode is equivalent to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and the quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many render modes as you like, from a quick preview up to full-quality images in highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">"" "if you click on the icon" "" "The render settings in the toolbar" "" "or in the View Render Modi menu, the following dialog will be opened:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it is a name that lets you recognize the features of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the size chart size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the intersecting field and enter the image section to render into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination-field quality you can select the properties, which & Povray; used for rendering. this is done from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection lighting. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User's Guide to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel, different errors can occur. these pictures often have a Moiré pattern or tier effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel in the display. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally, pictures with this property see better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you switch on anti-aliasing, calculates and links & Povray; more than a ray per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as a standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling covers the adjacent pixels. the second method is adaptiv-recursive; recursive because each pixel is repeated and adapted again and again because the recursion depth depends on calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray follows a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then both pixels are processed by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of four additional points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference then is:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Types of abs (1 -r 2) + abs (b 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the default threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which can be followed separately and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called jittering. if you turn on Jittering, change & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The final setting for the quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; which calculates diffuse light reflection. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can choose whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding rays have not hit any object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for display of & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly quit, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; select the Import menu item... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet the complete command range of & Povray;. if error messages or warnings appear when importing, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import this source code between the two particular comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds to the source code of the object in the open text file in the editor. to import objects to the scene, just select the source text in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor, you can paste source code for & Povray; likewise.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; render a scene. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in the Property View, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; User Documentation to the displayed object. set the path to your document and the version. support versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example high field data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the scene folder, you also need to enter the path to those files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the view field in the camera view and in the window type license plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can adjust the object capture of points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can adjust the grid separately for shifts, scaling and turning.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time to render. for some objects such as the sphere you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high detail fidelity for extended projections, all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this property gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to return.</seg>
<seg id="1068">If you cross a wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is represented in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">If you cross the floor, a floor below the objects is rendered. the floor is represented in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick the edge smoothing, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the section window instructions, it explains how to create and store window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">Drop down selector standard window ordering: displays all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window ordering when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window orders shows all existing window instructions. a new layout can be created by adding the Add button and deleting a selected layout with the button Clear.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window ordering is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views for the selected window ordering. new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the button removal.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column you create a new column on the right of the existing window, with Unten you will anchor the window under the existing window, with a map you get a map view in common with the previous view and floats the view not in the main window, but generates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without any more detailed knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this tutorial, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a sphere on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">However, you should consider the following warnings carefully before you complain that as a result you only receive a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set a camera, no rules can be applied for rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert light sources, your whole scene lies in the dark and you get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything error-free, you will see at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window ordering:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing icons of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select Edit menu item Edit. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create. in particular note that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera are found. in the user documentation to & Povray; for more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the camera's basic settings, this is reserved for later guides, but keep in mind that the camera has control points with which you can change the target of the camera. just click on a control point with the left mouse button and pull it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the user or the input button, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, you see here the scene from the view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. for example, you could insert a header (insert Endly Body Quader) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but that is a complicated method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a simpler option. you can use an infinite layer as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or the input button. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now shows the plane as well, albeit at the moment only as a limited finite level. if you render the scene, the plane stretches out to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree, you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor by clicking on the + in front of the object. in this case, you will only see the different parameters of the object. in this case, you will find only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the floor to the exercise a unit below the horizon line just to get to know some of these parameters. select shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but at the moment select something simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog opens, in which you can select how to insert the object. please select first subobject. the pigment is then displayed in the object tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = floor-pigment), with a click on the button preview, you can see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigments shows only a matt black material, because you still have to enter settings for the pigment. therefore, always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on Preview. now enter the colors for the pigment. again, there are many possibilities, but take now the simplest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on the header and bullet in the preview, click on the Apply button and then get the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the symbol, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, these are not the colors you expected. in the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. in the object tree select the entry color list. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more frequently, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select one-color each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should be able to run this step as you have already understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; the sphere is just as easy to create as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (don't forget to press the input button or the Apply button), so the ball has contact with the floor. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground, because you moved the floor to a unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering now yields a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears as a matt black material. in the next step, put a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have chosen the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already on the floor, give the ball a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select first subitem and change the name for example in sphere pigment. click on sphere pigment, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screen shots and click Apply or press the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflection already result in good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal is not selected yet:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of the possibilities offered by you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracing is a render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracing a scene, the renderer escapes hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that render the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this beam is reflected and broken by the objects, the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog. thus, the scene pixels are processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you watch the scene. without a light source you don't see anything, the picture is just black. obviously every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest item in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you will need to enter a name and a storage space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last saved memory are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you still have unsaved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last reversed command. you can select this menu item only if you have used editing.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window ordering and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new layout or overwrite an existing layout.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu, you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the appearance, the shortcuts and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcuts. you can use this option to set predefined Shortcuts for & kpovmodeler; modify or add new commands.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up toolbars. you can use this option to add toolbar icons to & kpovmodeler; add and remove commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A dump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic shapes are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture mapping is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by applying an image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can either be displayed in an own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files you can click with & LMBn, or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can choose whether each image should be displayed in a separate window, or if all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, just type the first character of the file name in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the lower right corner. if a suitable file name has been found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In Dialogue Classification - & kuickshow; there are five flashcards. in three of them, General and Processing and Slideshow, you can set the mode of operation of & kuickshow; set. in the other two, short instructions for the display window and short instructions for the browser, the shortcuts for each window can be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, the images are opened in full screen mode. if the image is not large enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area is filled with the background color, which you can set further down. default is not full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Is this point enabled, loads & cuickshow; already the next image in the folder, while you still look at the current image. this reduces the delay if you choose the next picture, and is especially suitable for a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="1137">With this option stores & cuickshow; when you exit the name of the recently opened folder. at the next start, open & kuickshow; this folder in the browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click on the colored bar to select a background color. this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode. if in the window mode the window is larger than the picture, the background will also be filled with the selected color.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can & kuickshow; set up so that only some of the file types can be displayed, which can display the program as well.</seg>
<seg id="1140">This option increases the display window to the full screen for large images. this option is turned on as default.</seg>

<seg id="1183">Amarok's DCOP interface has many general functions, mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP features of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlist, and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; additionally, Amarok has some own command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependency. please check in your script if all required modules are present and use kdialog to enable the user to know why a script does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'corundum' rescue LoadError error = 'corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.'</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command; each KDE installation should be included.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripts allow the execution of external programs and commands. for this, the exec () function is usually used. in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this purpose, strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should continuously monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore events when there is no use.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weist the script to display the setup dialog. to save and store the setup data, each script must take care of itself. when a script is started, Amarok sets the work folder to the folder where all the data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signals that a new piece is being played. the script could now & zb; with DCOP functions, the script could retrieve more information about the new piece (for example, the metadata or the unit length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newVolume indicates a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Customize: submenu itemTitle controls the path to the selected files of the playlist, when a custom menu item is clicked. submenu and itemTitle are also passed to allow the script to identify the clicked entry. to remove an entry, you can use dcop amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & amarok; ends itself, or when the user stops a script, sends & amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to handle, for example, cleaning up data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages that the user & zb has downloaded from a webserver. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2). we recommend an archive name such as .bz2, so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as an Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the exhaustion amarokscript. for this reason, you should name your script packages right away.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">When your script package is ready, you can upload it to www.kde-apps.org and append the link to the Wiki script page of & amarok. for your entry on kde-apps you should use the amarok category; scripts.</seg>

<seg id="1242">& amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the kdelibs package and otherwise no other KDE packages. you need to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included, because & amarok; some of them need to be found for example modules or scripts). we have written a small guide how to compile kdelibs minimally.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD suggest that your window manager will keep the relevant standards from freedestop.org. Gnome will work, but Fluxbox will work for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file by logging in ~ / .kde / share / apps / amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this bug to the Taglib Developer on bugs.kde.org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash. after that, you can delete the file and create the collection again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most of the time, it is because Taglib crashes when reading the meta information from this file. please report this bug to the Taglib developer on bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for it in & amarok; is somewhat mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all libraries used by & amarok are compiled with the same compiler version. if, for example, GCC 3.4, TagLib was compiled with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crashes when processing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you are using KDE with artsd then disable automatic switch off if inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens in a crash). if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 in the meta-information, but do not mark them as Unicode. the following Perl script solves the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "The file $ARP [0] does not exist" unless -f $ARP [0]; use MP3:: mplib; my $mp3 = MP3:: mplib; my $mp3 = $MP3- &gt; get _ v2tag; print "Error while writing the tags from $ARP [0]\" unless $MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>
<seg id="1253">This script requires the Perl module MP3:: mplib. it can be installed with this command: Perl -MCPAN -e 'install MP3:: mplib'</seg>
<seg id="1254">& amarok; s symbols in the status bar (Random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist) are always active in KDE 3.4.0. this is a well-known bug in KDE 3.4.0. sometimes the symbol effects will be forgotten. note that in some cases, you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows their effect.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarokapp: symbol lookup error: amarokapp: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixmapERK7QPixmap, then check if Amarok uses the correct Qt library. this can be seen with ldd 'which amarokapp' _ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this bug, you may need to remove any conflicting Qt version or adjust / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok will find the right version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are several possibilities. most installation problems are most easily solved by using an expert your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or developers. use the forum and the IRC under irc.freenode.net in channel # amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable to search for help. please only use a bug there if you have something to fix a bug in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & amarok; only an empty playlist appears. how do music pieces come in there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is easy. use the file browser on the left-hand side and open the desired folder. then drag the files into the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the GUI very intuitive, the Start subwindow has been converted to the Statistics window. you will find it under Extras statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars stand for the evaluation by the user while the points are calculated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To rate pieces, the review column must be displayed in the playlist. click anywhere in the new application column to specify the rating for a piece. you can also use the short commands Windows + [1-5]. this also works if Amarok is in the background.</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device must provide a mixer. a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or through the dmix module for alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you search for the cause of the problem and a solution. for GStreamer, you may need to specify another Sink (e.g. ossesink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">You can't just send an MP3 to ALSA, you would only hear a white noise. GStreamer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead. GStreamer is reading the file, decodes it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also decodes the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open Control Center Sound & Multimedia Sound System. enable sound server with highest priority (real-time prioritization) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure artswrecked suid is set:</seg>

<seg id="1326">Creating a playlist is very simple. drag some entries from the collection browser to the playlist. the small text field for filtering the collection makes it easier for you to search for certain pieces. if you are happy with the playlist, then you can save them with the help of a button playlist. you can find this button in the toolbar of the playlist window.</seg>
<seg id="1327">If you have your own playlists, you can add them to the playlist. if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection, and you have the option to import playlists, then these playlists are already in the tree view.</seg>
<seg id="1328">To play an audio CD, please select actions audio CD in the menu bar. it opens a file browser with several folders and CD pieces in WAV format. simply drag the wav files to the playlist and then press the button Playback.</seg>

<seg id="1332">If you install these packages via a package management system (e.g. RPM or apt), you also need to install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any normal multimedia player has also & amarok; a player window with the most important functions. in addition, & amarok; however, a playlist that is superior to all the others.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & amarok are used, including the creation of a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one-click & amarok; control center. at the top of the window is a run textual display showing the currently running piece or current stream. directly below is the area that displays the game time, bit rate and sample rate of the current play. a click on this field changes the display of the already expired playing time to the remaining play time of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, even under the context menu. you can switch from the available analyzer by clicking with the left mouse button on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & amarok; -Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer is displayed in an independent, extensible window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The PL and EQ buttons are also located under the run-text display. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlist window while the EQ button is used to set up equalizers.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the play position slider. use the slide controls to adjust the play position or volume. with the playback buttons you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or earlier piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The use of the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio operators. there are 17 presets, from classical to techno, and you can easily create your own presets.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To display the equalizer, use Tools Equalizer from the main menu or click the button EQ in the player window. once you check the check box EQ, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The Playlist of & amarok; is the most widely developed playlist of all available multimedia players. it has many features that are not available in any other player. but don't let the plethora of features frighten them, they're all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be divided into two main areas, the navigation area on the left. in the navigation area, you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser contains three subwindows: music, text and performer. these three subwindows are later explained in detail. they provide information about the current piece to different aspects.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have used earlier versions of & amarok, you may notice that the subwindow has dropped off. the information displayed there is now divided into other parts of & amarok; the information in the statistics window can be collected (Extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first area in this subwindow displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, performer and the album. below you see the cover picture of the album and beside it a MusicBrainz icon. click on this icon to track the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">You can find more information about the current piece under the MusicBrainz symbol. here you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png will be supported. the context browser will also display covers images that were downloaded either with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the Recommended Pieces are the favorite pieces of this interpreter. this section shows the five highest-rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can choose which information to be displayed in the music subwindow. right-click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. when you click on an album, it will be opened and you will see the album's content.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately. you can also right click on it and then select one of the options for adding the play or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">This function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try & amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script is yet running, you can choose which should be started.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version will then be stored in & amarok; s collection database.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The search button searches a search on google.com after the song text for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping - grouping only the top layer, each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - In addition, the pieces are arranged according to the artist. if you want to see constellations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Various Interpreten.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Interpret / Year - Album - Sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - Albumname is used.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically among each other. the interpreter is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping Genre / Interpret - your songs are sorted by genre, including by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Interpret / Album - This attitude works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the artist.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons you can adjust and combine grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button, you can change the settings to the collection. note: & amarok; will automatically re-capture your collection once you change something at the selected folders. if you own many pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">A search filter is located right below the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. instructions for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter you will find a selection box with which you can filter the recently added pieces to your collection. you can choose different time windows, starting from the last 24 hours to a year. furthermore, you can also select your total collection, which will enable the filter to be switched off practically.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser, you will get the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Loading - This will empty the current playlist and add the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attaching to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry you will reach the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set items in queues - This function will add the selected pieces to the queue. this will be played next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as playlist. you'll be asked for a name under which the list is to be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces into the queue for transfer to the media player. for more details, see the section on the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - thus the selected pieces are sent to K3b and burned either as data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(n) move files to the trash bin... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Mark as a composition - Selects the selected album as a compilation, whereupon it appears under different interprets.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Pick up selection - Change a album marked as a compilation back to a normal album. the album will then no longer be displayed under different performers but again under the accompanying interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser simplifies the handling of many playlists. among other things, it also contains intelligent playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist contains the smart playlists. they use & amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists for runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created smart playlists are possible. click Smart Playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist. there, you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Media player subwindow will be used for the connection of & amarok; for example, to use your iPod with & amarok; for example, it must be embedded in / mnt / ipod. if & amarok; started, you will find the pieces sorted on your iPod by interpreter in the upper list view of the media player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired songs from the playlist and drop them to the performer list. if you're done, click Apply. by doing so, the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod. if the transmission is complete, stop & amarok; and loosen the drive connection for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">The tool bar is a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar that lets you pick music from a given URL. if you enter for example tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz and press input button, you can access music in the music .tar.gz file. now you can drag the music from there to the playlist and drop.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, it can be difficult to attach files by simply drop down. in this case, holding down the Shift key may be useful: thus, dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list, and not on the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">The playlist contains all pieces attached to you to play. you can change the order by simply drag the entries to the desired location using the mouse. once you enter the letter there is a text box in which you can enter a filter. in order to reset the filter, press the back button until the text box is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter separate search terms by spaces, you will search for entries that contain all search terms. if you enter, for example, one two three, the search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">For example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all items containing one or two or three (or a combination thereof) are found.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries that contain spaces, then enclose the search term with full-footed feet: Mike Oldfield. this is searched for entries that include Mike Oldfield, but not for entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific search column, you can also search for larger or smaller ones. for example: rating: &gt; 50. This search for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a certain search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: - something looks for pieces that do not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants as you like. example: Mike Oldfield OR scores: &gt; 50 comment: bad. this looks for all the pieces that include either Mike Oldfield, or a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bad.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of entries by holding the Ctrl key, and right-clicking on the entries in the desired order. entries then receive a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left, you will find the Add button that lets you add the playlist. to the right, you can save playlists, empty playlists, and assign mixers.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, follow the undo and restore buttons, so you can undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1400">There are many more available buttons for the toolbar, for example, rendition controls and volume controls. you can set up the buttons shown by clicking on the menu and selecting toolbars...</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist. it shows the title of the current play, the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces. furthermore, the status for random mode and retrieval can be easily changed by double clicking with the mouse in the corresponding display area.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do this, disable the status bar flag in general settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking in the playlist on the menu. by this menu, you can reach the settings of & amarok.</seg>

<seg id="1472">Burn a previously created DVD image. the dialog will prompt you for a * .iso file as a source of data, which can then be fired immediately by pressing the burning button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">This dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents, but can also be used everywhere. it contains information about the read video, encoding settings, and even ways to change the size and cut black edges.</seg>

<seg id="1477">The folder view includes an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives. if the content view is enabled, their contents will be displayed in the content view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info, locks and unlock the drive or ejecting the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The Content View allows selecting and dragging files into the view view. the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The head bar is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the head bar has no real function, it only looks pretty and separates the view from the rest of the views.</seg>

<seg id="1481">This will start the k3b; setup wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs. system administrator privileges are required for this, so you have to enter the password for the system administrator (root) when starting the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Open the settings of & k3b; here general program settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should work immediately. this dialog is for customizing and adjustment of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many others & kde; -applications also, equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script, for example.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line, or use the slightly more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, therefore your taste and type of task is decisive, which of the programs you give preference.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you are using the dcop command line program. to be able to use the & DCOP; you need to make sure you have started before, that & k3b; then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; functions common to all & kde; program in common, supports & k3b; mainly two more parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides features such as copyCD, formatted DVD and other features to generate new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">Void burnDvd () void burnCdImage () void burnCdImage () void burndvd () void burnDvd () void burnDvd () void burnDvd () void burnDvd () void burndvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method, you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project via the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can only be used for data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString) void returns (QString) void returns (QString path, QString) void returns (QString path, QString NewName) void setVolume ID (QString path, QString NewName) void setVolume ID (QString)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then add files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface CreateDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT addurl / home / truffle / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>

<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in wav files on the hard drive) and by many encoding those that encode these wav files. currently lame for MP3, oggenc for Oggs and FLAC (lossless compression) are currently supported (These Kodiers must be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read out and stored in wav files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these wav files (usually one per caption) are compressed into the mp3 or OGG format or also in other formats such as the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must now be done.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other compilers must be installed. all of these programs are usually already available for any Linux distribution, so it is very likely not necessary to compile it yourself. however, only the Kodizer packages must be installed which are needed. if for example FLAC is not used, its installation is also not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which coding / file format is to be used? chapter Welcher Kodizer gives a small introduction to Kodizers, Audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia to read out the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to crack any copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device does not cover the protection, it is not possible to read the mechanisms of copy protection. simply avoid buying pirated audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While the setup needs to be done only once (but the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found), the daily use of reading a & CD; on the hard drive explains. this will (hopefully) lead to the understanding of the lean approach of the user interface, which you will often stumble over in the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which codec programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>

<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the commands of the main window. on the page, step by step, you will find more information on how this program is used, as well as screen shots with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program.</seg>

<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the notifications (such as protocols, Piepsen) for program events (such as read & CD; exit).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog by & kaudiocreator; with different flashcards (such as encoder, to set up the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, compilers and compression ratios and helps you select the correct coding.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other like 'shorten' or 'monkey' that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression ratios and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate, the differences become less important, since both compactors produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'nt so 'free, lame is still provided free with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (with high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality with lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard on a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG play devices is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special car stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces and has a very high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. requires always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a song. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality regardless of the size of the file, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information retrieved manually or fetched through the program automatically from the freedb over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / used with & kaudio Creator; and the encoding program to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of programming settings for the Kodiers and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the coding machines explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; to add title to the keywords (English: day) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt from lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator; will be added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button description in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download information instead of themselves into the computer. it is important to note that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (editor of the translator: this means the author) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent that you from the & CD; information released publicly on the CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music business can be harmed.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is actively to select a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb can be used with another (falsified) address as the one in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears, the email address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (this can only know the programmer who checks the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; to use freedb it should be used geographically closest to the nearest mirror server. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more about it, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; please note that the cdparanoia package needs to be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read wav files, the codec and thus the desired file format can be selected. at the first opening, pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (lossless compression for audio data) are located on the tab to set up the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodizer package must be installed by the Linux distribution concerned before the codec can be used. this is also necessary for the predefined codec. more information on Kodiers is available in the chapter Welcher Kodizer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a coding, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and reading rights on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio codec of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;). try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give an indication of what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD; to do so, check the cover of the & CD; this won't work!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, you can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; read. we'll use lame '--preset extreme' to produce MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords.</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can for example be found with a search engine as it is considered non-free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which of course you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission to it (eg by trying to copy something into / usr / share).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setting up of & kaudiokillers;, something that is probably just done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each reading & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the required encoding for the compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them with any reading of a & CD; change once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program to read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">Here is not much to do here. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything will be left / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only select incomplete information so that you will be informed if information is missing to generate keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">Simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the freedb server during the reading of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second drop-down selector is easier, becomes a & CD; entry will start immediately reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk, if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entrys, they can be easily changed. the directory name or file name will be changed with Konqueror &gt; and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to enter everything manually, disable the selection fields and freedb will not be used. you can work with freedb locally in offline mode if you want to use the database before. however, this is over 620 MB large, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data query, for retrieving the & CD; information from freedb servers via the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section above freedb.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we didn't download the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server near you. on this way, the load between the hosts is distributed. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equally as far as the server is concerned, as many firewalls cache the protocol 8880 by default, there may be more luck with the 80 protocol, as the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to send data to the freedb server. deactivating the first check box should be enough.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take over the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the / tmp folder exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous pieces: sorry, there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author does not know, therefore simply try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece, throw this to the & CD; discard at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must be specified the path / folder in which the wav files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to make something with the wav files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something must be smoothed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset Extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned earlier, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bit rate is about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the creation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneous WAV files: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to encode more than one wav file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic set up of & kaudiokillator.This configuration is used as the default for any reading of a & CD; used. if you have wisely chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section we describe how the process of reading the & CD; on the hard disk runs. we will create and setup MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard drive, was written in the previous section and set up. first, a connection to the Internet is built, since we are comfortable and the & CD; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each reading & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet included in freedb, the screenshots look a bit different from those for one & CD; with successful from freedb fetched data. therefore, you will learn the & CD; to manually enter data instead of extracting them from the Internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example. it's a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not yet happened, now the & CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screen shot. this only when the & CD; as audio CD; can be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, look in the questions and answers section for help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully fetched by the freedb, all titles of the songs are already filled and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; there is a window appears, and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but get the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD-Editor - Input of the CD-data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the 'current title' input field, the rest of the data in the 'Album' input field.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must no longer be entered in the 'current title' input field unless you have a composition with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The bottom commentary box can be used for individual comments inidividually per piece, the album comment field is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words with capital letters begin or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment area. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least to what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed. this option is set on the Encoding Settings tab.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later with tag editor at any time. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also recreate ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all the coding / file formats. see the help file for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the & CD; for more information go to freedb.org's website and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "after choosing" "" "OK" "" "you come back to the main window. just click on the row with the second piece." ""</seg>
<seg id="1593">The CD editor window appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the input data we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the field of the current play.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Note: this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album will be shown above the product list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check sign in front of each line of a piece. only the tracks that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line shuts down the selection of the piece, or press the button All items selected at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When clicking on the button selection has started reading the selection process, this window appears to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tabs to switch to the order window. it is located in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is currently being read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the bottom left of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message will see if you are trying to work with a code that you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>

<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: assignment # 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into MP3 format. thus, reading and coding are parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code. with performance-sensitive machines, the result is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out while another piece is encoded and a third order is placed in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message appears for a short time in the top left of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudio Creator;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the Kodizer of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1609">This section is intended for people who compile from source files, and are not intended for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running, then the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs has many variations of settings. best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it shows screenshots of the various settings of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still reading? even if only the help menu was clicked on after the first start of the program, without any clue as it should go on from this somehow empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD at the time of the program starts; in the drive), or from an unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it all about? anyone reading this has probably already started the program. it should look something like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no e-mail. the author can't maintain this manual. it's the first version for a manual to & kaudiocreator; thought. whoever wants to add or change something useful may do it. at least only after the contact with the author. and if you read this, he has left this section and is therefore in agreement with this proposal.</seg>

<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and Karaokespie of & kde; besides others, with real-time graphics and karaoke live recording of lyrics, it also has some features that other & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so should work on all systems with OSS and & kde; support also the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver that is needed for GUS maps. alsa is involved as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color, making it easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & Drop to drag & drop; any MIDI file from a & konqueror; drag and drop windows to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards in order to save text in MIDI files (song events or text events).</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. when you play & kde; when playing a song, kmid will start with the same song next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the Lup driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; -window into the & kmid; window. this also works with multiple songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button in the toolbar, select the record from the menu item, or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts as soon as you drag it to the & kmid; window. (for several pieces, they are added to a collection and then played sequentially.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">As soon as you play a piece, you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and driving with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the tempo display and adjust the playback speed. to get back the original tempo, double-click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played a pressure on the space bar like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item, thus interrupts the play. pressing the space bar while no piece is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music. some pieces use text-event, others use song-word-event and again other both. some pieces have no text at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set what events are to be displayed and even better: the type of event is determined automatically, which uses a song so that you don't have to set anything manually. so, if you activate the entry Automatic text selection in the Settings menu, the karaoke text will automatically be selected. however, you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set up an event type, select the entries in the menu item or song events from the Settings menu. the same function also has the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which you summarize. these are played back in series. in this section, you can see how to use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you can find them in the collection under the point Organizing.... Click New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking Copy and then specifying the name for the new collection. at the beginning, this collection will contain the same songs as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set each of the bundles in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not saved. remember that when you add a lot of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there, you can add a song with the Add button. again, the file dialog appears, with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when you open (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If Automatically Adding to the collection is not enabled, the temporary collection is activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the continued pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the series from the submenu sequence of the menu collections, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the select list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song further, select the button next song, record next song from the menu item or press the button arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the button Previous piece, record Previous piece from the menu item or press the button arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to delete and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter as it is not saved when you leave & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers which are not General MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General MIDI events translate into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano into events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and thus always lets a trumpet sound if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you don't need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM equipment and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI maps, so you need to edit the appropriate file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all the necessary requirements for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the Keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define Keymap "Name of Keymap..." END Define Keymap "Another Keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an email, so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section describes how the patches of General MIDI are mapped to your specific keyboard. general usage looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the gender sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you must not change the order, nor leave any line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllkeysTo M is used to lay all the sounds that this instrument requires to sound with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a gun fire (GM patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which sounds similar to a gun shot. to do so, enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 (gun fire), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here is meant with the term drum patch of the patch, where each sound represents a different percussion instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc;) and not the one where the tone is the pitch of the always same drum (as some keyboards possess).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is used to specify how sounds are mapped on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several key maps for each channel and instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to map tones on the percussion channel. see for example the supplied keyboard maps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, just make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI channel 10, others need 16 or 9 channels).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is shown on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keyword will need to be defined with the name name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will attempt to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x will always be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch can be useful for example to always use the percussions-patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-benefit event with the value n, it is converted with the n * (r / 4096) and then passed on. the value 4096 is used to prevent decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM pretends that a keyboard, which is supposed to play a pitch benefit event with the value 4096, should play a sound higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards are trying to play two sounds up to one octave. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. you can find it in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you can see which sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The View channel view (until now) has two different views to display the played sounds. in the View menu, select View Viewing view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed-LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you get a similar sound quality. in a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; this happens because & kmid; to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">OK, therefore supports & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror; select all the files and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">By default, enable automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow down playback. to restore the standard tempo, double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on one & kde; Desktop a & konqueror; -window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or attached (if I play a MIDI file) or I want to play a file, merely switch to the & konqueror; -windows and drag the desired file into the & kmid window.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you only want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection, disable automatic addition to the collection, and the new one; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.M., B.M. and C.mid. first you only want to play the first file. so set the setting Automatic Adding to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly those a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.M. and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, that animates me to program on & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Laga (Spain). I am studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; Laga. at the moment I am studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; Laga. at the moment I am studying programming, collecting MIDI files, making music and propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or if you simply want to make me happy, write me an email: larprosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arracis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">If you send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will be among friends by & kmid; list (if you want to). before sending a MIDI file, you should contact me since I may have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and didn't get money from anyone for it. I would like to point out that I can only keep programming because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AWE cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also applies to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the AWE support, Ignacio Garcia for testing the AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Peter Gritsch, Magnus pepper, Urko Lusa, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, an error message or even a supportive e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course, my thanks also all these outstanding musicians on the net, who give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition, & kmid; can also be found on its homepage, which is located under http: / / www.arracis.es / ~ rlargents.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, search for information and view pictures. you can also find links to pages with other karaoke-songs, & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you need to compile & kmid with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had a sound card, except that you can of course not hear music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files of the formats supported by MPlayer or Phonon, as well as for playback of DVD, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not yet finished as & kde; it was installed on this computer.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help, please check the page The KDE website on new versions, or send the question to The & kde; user mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always a window with the central view. optionally, there is a window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that is only displayed when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred links under the bookmark menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy. when you click an entry, its group and all its subsets are copied to the current category and the reproduction starts with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current play ', TV and permanent playlists can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files. of course you can only do that if & KMPlayer; not running. the different files in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmPlayer folder can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, select the same playlist from the menu and select either the editing mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without matching the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be enabled by changing the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and changing [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will notice the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / cMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during start-up doesn't need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would be annoying at the end-animation, the user can therefore end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a startup animation can be displaying a favorite picture: & lt; smilgt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / / / home / Koos / mum.gif; & lt; & lt; / body-; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / / / home / Koos / mum.gif; & lt; & lt; & lt; / / / home / Koos / mum.gif; & lt; & lt; & lt; / / / home / Koos / mum.gif; & lt; & lt;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a Rider for configuring MPlayer in the & KMPlayer configuration dialog; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'Console' in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this playback device in the & KMPlayer configuration dialog; everything must be configured by manually editing the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc file, such as setting the backend via mimetype. here is an example of how a flash is played with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">"" "" "" "flash" "" "can be played inside & KMPlayer; it can even be added to the special embed for YouTube in the playlist XML." ""</seg>
<seg id="1724">In order for the & KMPlayer to play 'flash' in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module must be specified as service provider for the Mime type application / x-shockwave-flash in the setup dialog file Assets of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; can be started in a console application and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library. the started process is called cramplayer. if there are no errors here, the backend issue is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">So that a given backend is taken for a given mime type (of course only if this has been determined), it must be done manually by modifying the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc file. for example, phonon should return all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either by means of MPlayer or XVideo (this requires kxvplayer). before TV can be digested, the device must be used and the TV channels can be configured.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (Video Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, you can use the dialog in the Settings under - &gt; Quele- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there you should recognize ports from which one is selected. the correct name probably has a dvb contained in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Because the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this kind of playing video devices under Linux is the only one). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension must be functional for the X server. therefore, the XFree86 server must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, KMPlayer uses various names for the sources. at the time of the creation of this documentation, these are dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, introversion, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrsource.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Is there any clue how to make my CDROM drive quieter when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom command is to run as a user root after the device is inserted. it is absolutely certain that / dev / cdrom can be found on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts only slowly, why does each time my CPU needs to be tested for its performance?</seg>
<seg id="1734">Note: the answer is overhauled. kxineplayer automatically needs the last saved value, only the first time xine will check the CPU.</seg>

<seg id="1748">& Kile; is an integrated & latex; environment for the & kde; Desktop. & Kile; offers the possibility to use all & latex; functions in a graphical interface and within this one simple, immediate and tailor-made access to all & latex; programs. in conclusion, the easy to use wizard, the & latex; reference and the powerful project management.</seg>
<seg id="1749">To learn more about posters; and to learn its options, the manual should be used to Kate. users of & Kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1750">For & latex; is the right language: Lay-TECH. while the original & tex is difficult to use, it can also use a layon (lay) & latex; macros. a less demanding but realistic explanation is that it comes from the surname of Leslie La mport.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In this case only a good overview of & latex is given, it is not the ultimate book for it. to be able to master correctly, good books should be used e.g. H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The introduction contains at least the command\\ documentclass, the body starts with the command\\ cease {document} and must be closed with the command\\ end {document} and must be closed with the command\\ end {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The quick entry wizard by & Kile; is a useful feature for the quick creation of a document in & kile; the selection of the wizard (menu) offers some options for creating the document. some settings related to the document can also be made.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this is the type of document to be created: article (article), book [book], letter [letter], report [report], article (DIN) [scrtcl], Book (DIN) [scrtcl], Projector [beamer], Foils [Prosper], Foils [Prosper] or custom.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Encoding: this sets the character encoding. it should use the character encoding of the system. modern systems are increasingly using UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best UTF-8X should be used (for the correct processing of the & latex; -documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used add-on packages for & latex; for the integration it only has to be selected in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), book (DIN), report (DIN), letter (DIN): the documentation classes of Koma-Script (for compliance with German DIN regulations). you should always find use when creating German texts.</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users don't have to worry about it. they are merely a brief description of the functions and further information on this are given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; offers - as well as other source code editors - the highlighting of the used commands, settings and elements (as well as unmatched). if you see larger areas of a large text on the screen, it is with great likelihood that some mathematical environment has not been closed.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With automatic completion of the surroundings is created by entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) of & kile; automatically a blank line (for entering the text) and the associated row to the shroud of the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be disabled in the menu settings box; LaTeX commands may be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually subdivided into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document to the following elements (part is the highest and subparagraph the bottom element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a single click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex, file recovery can be very helpful. once a DVI; file is created, skip and kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button on the DVI; viewer to the corresponding line in & latex; source text.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the standard output of & tex; or & latex; there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the back scan, the elements of the DVI; file is plugged with the editor, and as soon as an element in the DVI; file was clicked, the exact opposite of it. as soon as a section in the & latex; source text was clicked, the corresponding location in the DVI; viewer was jumped.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this feature is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, work is simplified with other .tex files. when using a project, a project-wide master document on project project settings can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Rapid build: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is displayed automatically (unless there is no error in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">Video surveillance: in this mode, the DVI; file is supported on Ã ¶ nderungenâ, and there is no call of & eyepiece; after the quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit Toolbar, the three large selection fields should be noticed. the selection fields have been developed for the fast entry of common elements into the document. the first selection field is for the rapid breakdown of the document into parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; commands for the division are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The Other is for submitting articles such as keywords, fuelling notes or references. the available options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command, a name for a section, a picture or a different element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a specified designation (select a selection box possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">The author has good experience with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the author has good experience with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files may also be written in & kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down box named GrÃ ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for determining the font size. the fonts for the main text, grounding nodes etc. can be set. the following fonts are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile, two options are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting document type and placing the settings. 2. the document can be written from the bottom up with the hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] defines the font. if the font is not specified at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">As soon as the above source code example has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the simplest way to do this is to use the menu build or the press of a button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & Kile; for saving automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the document is compiling, it should be searched for errors in logging. if you are using the Quick Start & Okularline, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the recording should also be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font 12 is created and only a few slits should have another font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} allows the change of the fonts within the environment â t-waking.</seg>
<seg id="1781">Changes are supervised only within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no restriction (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the readability and user-friendliness of the document. for example, certain fonts, bold prints, italics, underscores, etc. can be added. these commands end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the italics pressure and is as long as it is closed with a\ end} or any other environment. a single word in a set can be displayed italic with\\ temh {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. quote starts with\\ begin {quote} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to write the source code with the & latex; markup language is displayed, a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & kile;</seg>
<seg id="1786">As soon as a little text has been entered in the wizard, some adjustments for the better readability of the document should be executed. to do this, at least one quote, a few places in bold and italics, and a poem are to be applied in order to see the differences between these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, the editor view or Ctrl E can be reversed back to the editor (in the internal viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file was created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">These files are created by & tex; or & latex; these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF -converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI; the same steps are necessary for creating the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can then be printed (in the viewer) by file (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; file was created from the & latex; source text, the conversion into desired other formats can begin with the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The preview search allows the direct jump from the editor to the appropriate position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; offers a suitable setting for all & latex. for this purpose only Modern under Settings box must be set up... Tools construction will be balanced.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to select the preview search, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a line of the source text and then click on preview searching. the jump to the appropriate location in the DVI; viewer takes place then.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; -document the corresponding & latex; -document from & kile; open and jump to the corresponding line. to do this & kile; in & occulars; set in & occulars; set in & occulars (Settings Okularline... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If the & DVI file doesn't open, a fault can be found. if there is a fault, it will be displayed in the log file or in the news window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file erects the source code of the source code. in the editor, the buttons of the LaTeX errors and the key LaTeX errors can be used for jumps between the errors. the log file must always be clicked on the error in logging and & kile; jump to the defective line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">When clicked on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window appears to select the template used for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting a blank document, a document can either be rewritten or the wizard will be used for the quick creation of a new document. for more information, see the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Frequent users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created in & kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or a new file will be created. & Kile; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting File template from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a file New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in settings box... settings can be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by the entry in the document class. typically it is used as follows:\\ documentarian [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {item}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated command in the editor. once the document has been created this way, the following steps must be executed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can then be selected instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files. if a simple way to create a template is needed, one should search for one in the internet and the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & kate; as an internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and producing of many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for posters; can be made directly from & kile in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about it and its possibilities, the manual should be used to Kate. users of & Kile; can start there directly with the reading of the chapter work with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex command reference, which can be called over the Mene.Help LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of almost all commands in & latex, and its syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with a clicked Ctrl key to select the & tex; meaning that in this way, clicking on\\ par from\\ par\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with the left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed shift button, parts of the source code can be selected in the Editing Pane.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to search and highlight the most different types of source code. for example, the & latex; commands from normal text and also mathematical formulas are distinguished by a different color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can capture additional bounce marks. this is an own type of bookmarks within the text. the menu entries, start-brands or the corresponding buttonback allows the jump to the next or last jump mark. thereby, this jump stamp is also highlighted so that it is automatically heard when entering a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as & kile; although & Posters; already excellent options were added in & kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source code always includes many environments and groups, and therefore supports & kile; special commands for their selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">This extended meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning, as this command also creates & latex; commands with a back panel (\\) and a additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del key. & Posters; provides the key Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & Kile; provides with its own commands here for a faster capability.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & kile; is included in the description to Edit select paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore & Kile; for other commands under Edit surroundings for a possible easy work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command will jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to connect the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located before or within the command\\ begin {surroundings}, it will jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested environment commands, the overview of the environment can quickly be lost. this command removes the recently opened environment, so that the nested environment structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups specified by brackets {...}. under Edit TeX group are some important commands that correspond to those from the editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command will jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed right in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command will jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the sharpened closing bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is located before or behind the sharpened clamp of a & tex; group #, the group jumps to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested grouped brackets, the overview of the structure can quickly be lost. this command completes the last opened group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex, two simple guide signs are used as a symbol. for the purpose-carrying execution is used in & kile; the sign "for two simple application symbols." & Kile; knows this case and carries two definitive signs for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic double-stop feature can be set up under Kile settings... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used for specific settings (e.g., English or French) and for German or French applications. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When shifting shift; Enter & kile; an intelligent line break. if the current position is within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & kile; not only a line break but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Complete the current line with\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>

<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables -environments and thereby all Et characters (amp;) among each other. at the click of Shift; Alt; amp; searches & kile; after the next tab in the underlying line.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & kate; already providing a good source code completion, it has been added to & Kile; there are several different modes built-in. three of them work according to demand and the other two are for automatic completion. all of these modes can be set for different modes of operation under Settings Chle... To be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="1839">Start a new environment using the command\\ begin {surroundings} & kile; automatically add the command\\ end {surroundings} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">At the click of the back button, the last letter of the input will be removed and, unfortunately, the complete list is created. on the other hand, the list may also shrink by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions are natural when selecting a command. alternatively, the descriptions can be inserted by & kile, so that a simply jump to these positions is possible with the Edit Jumpstart brand NÃ ¤ste bounce mark and the desired parameters can then be added.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings Chle; set up... Kile; All settings can be made to these lists. there can be different lists of lists for tex; - and & latex; commands as well as wishes of general language use can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Command mode is not useful for changing environments. there must always be a few letters with\\ begin to be entered and the call of completion mode will result in a large list of environment commands. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & kile; a special mode for locating environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the Comprehensive mode over the menu edit mode, or the Alt + Shift key, the command will automatically be opened to open the environment and it will appear\\ begin {. after that, the environment completion can be continued in the simplest way and terminated by pressing the input key.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment is automatically closed again. once & kile; realize that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command will be included.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings Kile; Create... Kile; All settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the list of completion mode for & tex; - and & latex; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; supports custom lists of paragraphs that are immediately replaced by longer strings. lists can be set up under Settings Chle... Kile Versions can be set up. as an example of a check list, the example.cwl file, for example, is included in L =\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word completion mode is introduced over the menu Editing or the Ctrl + Alt key key, the letter L is replaced by the string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large Ã ¶ rter books are not helpful for automatic completion. however, it has been found that many WÃ ¶ rters are written more than once in a document. thus, & Kile; the completion for all the already written wishes.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the menu settings box... Kile Versions can be deported. here, the threshold value for displaying compensation can also be specified.</seg>

<seg id="1852">The graphics edit dialog designs the insertion of graphics as simple as possible. to view the basics of graphics formats, the sections should be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as well known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages. if the PDF output is required, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted with ps2pdf into a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">In order to examine the results of the work, the source code must be compiled. all construction tools are grouped in the menu creation compilation, conversion and creation of view summarized.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source code for viewer like & eyepiece; or the further conversion can be used the Alt; 2 key; after that, the DVI; file can be viewed in the standard Viewer by Alt; 3, using Alt; 4 the DVI; file is converted to a PS file and viewed using Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the quick-build command, a viewer is usually called after compiling. if no embedded viewer is used, a new window will open each time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project will be asked about the project New Project.... This is where the following information is available for the project:</seg>

<seg id="1934">The name and Email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the nickname of the user and is used for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders and subproject leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can select from the list of team members who he is. this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the Setze button. the currently selected member (their identity) appears to be bold after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of your own identity are important in terms of messages and comments. see for further information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing members of the team: an event for information about team leaders can be created when something specific happens. see for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project, so that later it can be seen how much someone worked on it, or sending a message when a file is locked into the CVS as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the side event configuration of the shift; F7 Project Properties dialog can create, edit, and delete events.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An e-mail is sent to the addressees selected in the recipient list. the addressee may be a team or subproject leader.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Comments are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments through the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Comment entry is simple. it can either be selected the comment entry from the Editor context menu or the @ annotation keyword in a comment field followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes can be sent to a certain member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role) is a role in the project from the following possibilities: team Manager, subproject manager After the area and subproject managers, the appropriate area or subproject names should be given as shown in the following examples below.</seg>

<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up using Quanta settings... To be called. this dialogue extends across some pages that are treated one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus; regarding tags, including car completion, can be changed. entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Big / small-case of tags: large / small-case of automatically inserted tags. normal case-sensitive means the tags are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lower case of attributes: large / lowercase of automatically added attributes. normal case-sensitive means the attributes are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically include: if checked, is inserted for tags for which the closing tag is optional, this immediately after the & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Do not include optional tags: as above for all other tags, except for the simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Update start and end-tag automatically: if enabled, the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic replacement of accent notes: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding coding while typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mime types for detecting various types of files. using the Standard button, the default settings can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening open files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). however, this setting here is ejected by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD was not detected. however, this setting here will be ejected by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates backup copies on a regular basis so that in case of a power failure or crash at the next start of the program, the document can be recovered from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in one's own view (or the documentation in a tab), which makes it possible to view the documentation, preview and source text at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Setting the default window settings back to the next startup is useful when the user interface has been messed up by modifying MDI modes and / or appending views. it corresponds to the --resetymi command line parameter.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning message area serves the control of the possibility to disable the display of warnings by hooks of no more questions.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change the behavior of & VPL; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts, as well as the synchronization behavior of the VPL- and the source text view in shared mode. see the various modes see.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree that represents the mapping of parser nodes in the document can be adjusted in details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree it is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the area of structural tree settings, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the update frequency of the tree when editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree is to be opened automatically. empty nodes are empty spaces in the text, while empty groups are those where no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Shortcuts are divided into groups, each can be valid for multiple & DTEP; s. this means there may be a valid group for PHP, in which the ifclause is something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Plug-ins can be managed here. plug-ins are KPart applications from third party, which can be re-used by each KPart-capable application, the most known & konqueror; when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plug-in if it is not located at a booth like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load the component in "Only-Read" mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load. only-Lese-KParts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is enabled, then test & quantaplus; if the inserted information is correct. deselect allows to save the entry even if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, debugging has been completely redesigned. support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger has been discontinued, as is the support for the dbg debugger.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only a plugin is available, which inserts support for using & gubed; inquantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable debugger plugins in the project settings. with the Options button next to the debugger plugin, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; -user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view where the content of monitored variables is displayed. usually appears in the left Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view where all holding points, with time numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger is shown. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported features of the debugger, all or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">This action is used to connect to the debugger if necessary, or it shares the plug-in to listen to debug claims. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened using a debugger, so that normally it doesn't have to pay attention to it.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debugger session Start the session. closes the connection to the debugger or ends the listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to request a debug request. this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the Debugger output.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and running information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution continues. if it happens before a debug request has begun, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution continues. if it happens before a request is made, the execution begins as soon as a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger triggers the next statement in the script without deleting into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger triggers the next statement in the script, where possible in functions and include is corrected.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instruct the debugger to skip the statement and go to the next one as if it were not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered which is to be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set.</seg>

<seg id="1993">Document type editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; to give support for market and scripting languages as well as & CSS; they enable & quantaplus; their simplicity and flexibility makes & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s exist in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script language and & CSS;. & DTEP; s consist of two parts, the tag folder and toolbars. tag folders contain two file types, the & descriptionrc; and TagXML files with extension .tag. tool bars are handy, symbolic links of image buttons (above the editing window), which contain text and instructions more quickly in a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or created automatically from an existing DTD. see for details to convert.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, one & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the property dialogue, the & quantaplus; for the day displays. the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. tool bars enable fast insertion of tags in a document without the risk of a writing error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they contain only the & descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders carry the name of the description language and version, so there. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declares if they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a tagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing but a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when using, attr &gt; is an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for class class. the name of the base class for this class. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Valid only for type method. specify the name of the class where this method belongs. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day. (family 1 only)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Set a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">This item can only occur once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of the attribute. additionally, it contains other tags that describe how to display this attribute & etc; This is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source texts for the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; used to achieve the source of data.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and method name. the arguments passed to the method. can be empty or% tagdefinition, meaning the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag grouped together elements of a list. it can only happen once for an attribute description. it is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each one; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specify the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once (e.g. one for each; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may appear within the tags to be defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a day. this item is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with an & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces do not affect anything, but pay attention to & and & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and lt; text &gt; be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the tools dialog above in & quantaplus; -windows to start and check TagXML. to choose. another dialog will appear with simple instructions to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, the check is done only when the TagXML files are loaded in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following one example for a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this tagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file, a & PHP; overload function is described. the filename of this tagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it, accessible via DTD editing DTD settings. this can be edited by diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] version = shift 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD statement.

<seg id="2026">An action can be set with settings actions... created. click New action to create the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The shortcut assigned to this action. by clicking on the user button, a key shortcut can be assigned; with Kone, the current key shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document to the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful type of action. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document), are started. examples of & quantaplus; even are the Quick Start dialog or the different See in... Actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First the name of the script and the interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. This way & quantaplus is trying to find the script in the following locations: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will replace the current document URL. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name will be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; process. if by & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; from the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document, or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can receive input from & quantaplus; in the input field input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected range of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is normally only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, directed to the standard output; error messages are directed to the default output. it can be specified what is to be done with the text written to the standard output by setting the value in the output box:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in given case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the tag.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings to set actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Complete all necessary fields and add the tag to the matching toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "complete everything and, if the tag has attributes and you plan their use, enable dialog" "" "Edit Tag" "" "if available so that an input can be done when using the action." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & KMenu;, Graphics Show other programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixel by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the start of the day, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually called loose, starte, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user will be signalled that clicking this icon will insert a & lt; start; tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action. this happens through the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the application button and continue with other tags, if there are any, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar or it should be shared for a better overview by some dividers into several groups. open the toolbar setting dialog via Settings tool bar. make sure the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I would like to select the separator (top left) for my tool bar. after selecting the element to add to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to preview a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by scanning all symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the right folder. after new eXML does not exist, it will be created in root folders, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust their & descriptionrc; so that their tool bar (s) will be loaded (if a file is opened by the corresponding type).</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most worthy extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for scripting language or formatting language that you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how to create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository to see if someone has done that for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file. we will leave the first part to you, the second we will treat here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files, e.g. PHP; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = functions1 = tag2html tag1 = tag2html tag2 = tag2.html tag3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see now in the & PHP; documentation so somewhat:</seg>
<seg id="2062">Documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the shaft depth (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top of the tree view & mdash; folder will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing, but pay attention to & and & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">For example, when writing a & PHP; script should display the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. by marking the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separated context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your docrc file and save $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / Qanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you have indicated in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worthy to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation has been used to the & quantaplus; -community. you will not get rich but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the failed resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent via email to friends, partners, or anyone else. at different places there is an Email menu entry, such as DTD DTD packet (DTEP) with email, tool bar tool bar with email box, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the scripted tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all the other & quantaplus; users can download them. to make a contribution we recommend to sign the resources for which there is a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for your private GPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event you have several keys, you can select one. pass the input fields in the dialog New resource (URL preview can stay empty) and click OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploading from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), upload tool bar toolbar, and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, we examine & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by examining the integrity and signing. in case of problems it warns and it can then be aborted. please note the warning messages carefully. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message will appear with the indication of the originator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by & quantaplus; it can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files might be necessary in tagXML format. there is a simpler way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD menu and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description to be used. then the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / janta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">Doctype definitions sheet: the string that should appear in! doctype day, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine setting of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, bring & quantaplus; after conversion the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; can be adjusted. it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand these and full benefit from & quantaplus, one must first familiarise themselves with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to bring them closer to these concepts without their understanding & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the workspace is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for anyone who uses & quantaplus. from toolbars about actions everything that is marked as global is stored in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool bars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user in person.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; -patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project. simply put, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which empowers the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editing Pane, the tree views, the cartoons with information and toolbars. please note, and for more information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as the current, other or all tab, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the editor area will lead to another context menu related to the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / paste / paste), edit the tags under the mouse cursor, help the word under the mouse cursor or opening the file, if the string is called a file under the mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tool bars is really easy. if they want to insert a single day, e.g. & lt; PGT; insert the icon representing the tag. now you can insert the data for this straight-added tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The tree views (QIT;) allow you to navigate, open and strip in the information on & quantaplus. in the presentation with file managers are available for files, project, pattern templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus. this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouseclick. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting the files from the storage media can be performed using the displayed contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, an entire website, etc. all possibilities are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on the context they are used. the category depends on & quantaplus; work area. global templates are always available, local templates only for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the scripting languages available. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can access the information available to a script. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can access the information available to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one displays the internal structure of the active document. by clicking an element, the cursor is set in the document to the position of the element. by right-clicking an element, a list of commands with regard to navigation and refresher of the tree opens.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. with it it can change attributes and namespaces quickly. the entry system oriented to the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation for web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can add, edit and consider project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two tab at the bottom of the window to reach useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab shows information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the current document's markup. & quantaplus; scripts which are executed give all error messages (if there are any) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; tool bars are extensively expanded and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the tool bar of the toolbars is the ability to define their own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as a compressed Tar archive via & kmail;. if they get a toolbar in an email, they can secure and load them in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus; files on your system. to do this, autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are simple to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have trouble shooting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should ensure that there is no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH in front of their bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE desktop. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML editor, developers of & quantaplus began to deal with a obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; an independent, extensible markup language editor? well, this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer confined to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML, then & quantaplus; for this the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole & kde; developer community based. & quantaplus; followed, in good use of free software, the idea of Why develop what someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; scaffolding is not only this all possible but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to make use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation can be increased almost every task.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and was quickly expanded to a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL-licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">For more details, see help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror, or khelpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, with the oldest record being removed.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">When pasting from the clipboard there special characters are converted to & HTML; -Schelling, so they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard into & URL; description, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily used to insert & URL; s in the anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches off the block selection. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Goes straight to a line number. this is very useful if your & PHP; -script issue error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Looking for a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a sort of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window where you can see the display of the script and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Starting and switching the problem reporter at the lower edge of the & quantaplus. main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as one changes to the structural tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with entries forecasts or next, depending on the cursors position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents are grouped in the menu according to the file name of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; -Projects are saved with the .webprj file extension.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows to copy video files to your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project on the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded other input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings such as & quantaplus; the project manages. in chapter & quantaplus; -Projects you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a toolbar. these are stored in project you / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to that project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your tool bar. allows you to select the type of tool bar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. it only creates the name. actions must be set by settings actions... to be added. tool bars are saved through tool bar toolbars, or you'll be asked when you exit, whether you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Remove a toolbar from the field of view. it does not delete it from the disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team, so that the toolbar is present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows to upload tool bars to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download a & DTD; that made you or anyone else and convert to & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP are to be refreshed without updating all & DTEP; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global KDE folder, the loading fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool bar. if the default (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu that contains the tags / actions list on this toolbar in the Tags menu.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activating or disables the smart insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent inserting means that & quantaplus; inserting by toolbar is denied if that day contradicts the rules at this place.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plugins menu, the available plugins are listed under the menu items listed above. click on them. if you click on an enabled plug-in, it will be deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Selects the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available enhancements schemes depends on the kate; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Choose the type of line-end identifier. very useful if you know people using other OS platforms to develop. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Check the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Instant switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, changeover may sometimes need time or cause unnice graphics. recommended is the mapping mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which is equivalent to the display in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open sub-window. selecting a entry will activate the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Activates the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog will affect any application using the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Aligns the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of posters; find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears, in which you delete entries from the toolbar, or which add and edit the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the environment of the mouse, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom, since, for example, after completing the project name, the entire directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project. all of these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift; F7 project project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file is filled out automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase letters and without spaces with extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access, unless you edit local data. either a name (hostname.g..de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the remote host setting, an adjustment might be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and default toolbars. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to add files from the local filesystem to the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change. in server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">If files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be attached. if a project is started from scratch, not hooks.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option all files and folders are displayed inside the main folder, and you can select an exact selection according to manure.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the root folder. you can select the desired files by hooks or, by removing the tick, clip out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard comprises three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the subwindow profiles or modified using the Shift + F7 shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in detail. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholders possible), which are ignored in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to the above, including files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows you to select the debugger. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the debugger plug-in can be set using the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the subwindow profiles can be uploaded (see in), as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by contacting its own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, you can add event actions and add, change or delete events. event actions are executed when a pre-determined event occurs, such as securing a file. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Default opens & quantaplus; the last project that was opened. this behavior can currently not be affected.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, choose project open... from the menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will open and allow the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus; closed, the project file will be saved automatically. you'll be asked if you want to save changes before exiting, if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, but the entries are missing and opened with... in the right-click context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here different profiles can be selected. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows to remove the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button is dazzled to prevent removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the core memory and forgotten in the end of the program. this option is useful if frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather insecure password on the disk save option is not in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many upload profiles can be created, so that the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server's name on which the files should be copied. either a full qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not need to be changed unless the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it cannot be read easily, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in a project, i.e. by simply changing the view several files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted in the project or project toolbar, accessible via settings tool bar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which you have the most to do. this not only helps increase productivity, but also allows adjustment of & quantaplus; to your own working method.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, tool bars in & quantaplus are best stackable via the toolbar menu. use and addition distinguish themselves. adding toolbars is handled in the section Adding Tool Bar.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols can be set either by context menu (right-click on toolbar), in which a new tool bar can be created, other actions can be removed, toolbar rename or toolbars are executed, which can be specified in the dialog where you can see what actions should be visible on these or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu for an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and action edited, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">Toolbars and actions on them can set up toolbars in the Settings menu... and set settings actions.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are basically document skeletons, code snippets and files for linking. & quantaplus; they can copy, move, or link any existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in roughly the limitations that one imagines for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions outlined at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not pure text. it can be any file except text, i.e. images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc. binary templates are usually inserted in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url).</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be from any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally, more specific documents can be created in appropriate subfolders. one makes a simple scaffolding for the purpose and organises the work in a corresponding way to be efficient. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. see in for more information on the Template Tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents, based on a template, but the same text area. you can include everything from a commentary on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for entire websites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently, there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure as you like (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and choose File As Template Save as Local Template.</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has been done, you notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look in the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select Text in your document and click File As template to save selection as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be easily dragged with drag and drop to tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: just copy the file into a template folder. all file management functions can be used for it, such as drag and drop or paste over the Conqueror file tree.</seg>
<seg id="2207">In the file tree or in the project file tree view you can click a folder on the right and create site template, enter a name for the template and secure it. by default, it is backed up in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or a global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very targeted approach. you can pretext headers and footers or dynamically using & PHP; design, insert files or link them with them. in addition, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow template is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / tasanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / janta / templates. each of these folders is equivalent to one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder in the template table, right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection field with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is dazzled when parent attributes are inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and adapts for everything except the regular folders in the template view. if a root folder is set so, it would deactivate templates in this path unless they are explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text model. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows predefined or copied text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines or footers for all templates for a specific project and allows for copying of content templates to a folder with special headers / footers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, using the context menu (pointing right mouse button) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and pasting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; provides two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source editor available via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and, if necessary, turn back to the source editor where the changes made in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document containing & PHP, a small green symbol indicates the default of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. to edit, it is still necessary to edit the source text editor. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first one, except that the changes are visible in both the source editor and the VPL; editor and the cursor in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor is active, this mode is already active, the keystroke will move the active cursor from one window to another, maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and the source editor is adjustable via Settings Quanta. choose VPL; View may be set between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation: a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The document properties dialog is also called when a new document with the VPL; editor is created. this is used to reduce the manual encoding. this allows you to modify the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storing information about the document itself, e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click on the list allows to change the content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list. a change over the list is possible just as with the meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS stylist by pressing the file-open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The cursor is used as in a word processor, by moving with arrows. under rare circumstances, the cursor behaves peculiar. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and erased using a back button or removing button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is made in the same way across the toolbar, as in the source text editor. it is important to note that inserting tags previously already existing tags will not be removed, e.g. when an anchor day, surrounded with text inserted, must be removed any other surrounding anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some tool bars like the table wizard or the Listen-Wizard are disabled. they will work later in & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists toolbars must be used.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. why so & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many points. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the modified lines, but I could not see what exactly changed inside these lines. and there was no clue to the places where maybe only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare quickly text, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it into one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparisons and merging of folders. this function turned & kblur3; almost into a fully-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merging is fully supported. this is useful when two persons work independently on a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you to compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; when folder merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and mimics the possibilities of today's colour monitors. if you frequently have to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, you can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble if someone changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same, and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but are in different folders, then you can make the typing work easier by writing only the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">File sharing folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder folder 3 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Open dialog allows you to manually type file names, select the file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. you don't need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C blank, the analysis of the differences with two files is performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparisons or merging of folders is introduced. if for A a file is selected, for B and C however a folder, then use & knot; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is enabled, the input field is active for the target and can be edited. however, it is not necessarily necessary to specify an output file immediately. you can also do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set-up button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before starting the merge / merge operation.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only compare parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to draw text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in opening dialog, you don't have to select any files, you can simply close the dialog with the cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What is the idea behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, that would be a relatively big effort. you would need to create two appropriate files, load them in & knot, then compare them. now you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can't extract anything from & kdiff3; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program than trimming and pasting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source pane contains the A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Every Info line has a different color. (note that window C is optional.) Every Info line has a different color.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, you see in the color which file is different. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files. that is good to see in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some programming languages, where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (for C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the pre-processor and in rare, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that separates the text from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines. if the line breaks are activated, the line is dotted with broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison windows) also has an info line with the wording output:, the filename and [changes] if you have edited the result. usually, it already contains text by automatic merge, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the sprinkler buttons for the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference at the same time is a conflict that needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the row is marked in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed. (this will also include a jump in the position in the windows, where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for the current area and each on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging or manually editing; this is only a placeholder in the event that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source. this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a marking that you may copy and paste elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflicted; however, appears in the clipboard when you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting sources ignoring the options or activating ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys on the left, right, high, down, page on, page, beginning, end, Ctrl start and Ctrl end, Siw as you can also use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the default window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the insert button, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is insertion mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as explained in the merging and editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first difference, the next / previous difference (Ctrl-picture upward / Ctrl-picture downwards) or to the next / previous conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marker to the clipboard, you need to copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl Insert). if this is enabled, whatever you select is automatically copied to the clipboard and the manual copying is omitted. be careful with this option, as you may accidentally override the content of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use car return + line feed\\ r\.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically and restored at the next start. (menu Settings- &gt; KDiff3 set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with a fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also displays typefaces with variable width to choose, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences are displayed in italic script. if the chosen typeface does not support this representation, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be displayed straight. on these systems, the preset button will automatically display an uneven color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is checked, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the Tabulator button. otherwise, a tabulator character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press input or return, the indentation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, every selection will be automatically copied to the clipboard. manual copying to the clipboard is no longer necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-end type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used option on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, trying to find all the identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step, white characters are not ignored. even when merging white characters will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a car return character\\ r 'and a newline'\ 'at the end of a line, while others save only one newline'\ '. usually ignored & kdiff3; the car return character may be visible, but then as a white mark. during merging, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is deactivated. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Search for even smaller differences. the option is activated in the default setting. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slow with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the Automatically Advanced Mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will appear before the next unresolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">This is useful when white characters are less important in many files. (default is manual selection.) That is useful when white characters in many files are less important. if you only need this from time to time, then use the functions Select A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also concerns conflicts in numbers or comments when the options are ignored or ignore C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are covered in the chapter to scan and perform merging. see for details under Documentation for Directory Comparison and Configuration.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, the original version will be attached to the suffix .orig. if already such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further securing.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Changing this option does not apply to the current running program. you must & kdiff3; quit and restart to make the change active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is globally adjusted via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the top setting will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection fields for the encoding a short notice appears, which is the local encoding. (this can't be changed here and has for you purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Modify the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding for saving should be used here.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the preprocessing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) This option allows you to set the coding of the output of preprocessing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress the emphasis of changes in white characters in text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when comparing three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color-coded overview column. however, sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the space available on the screen for long lines. simply disable the less important windows. (this option is in the Windows menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the Windows menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you see the differences and then decide abruptly to merge the files. merge the current file in the merge menu even if you only compare two files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default names for the output file. (if this feature is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command will be visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own pre-processor which meets your requirements. you can use this function, for example, to cut out disturbing parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this pre-processing command. the output of the command will only be used for line comparison. you can write your own pre-processor that exactly matches your requirements. each entry line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting the diff-results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this preprocessing command for line tables to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert string (info: / cvs / keywords\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you may start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for another preprocessing command for line aberrs. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Any character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, so virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to perform several assignments at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the substitutions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of used, you can also use something different such as perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replace / SCHALTER 'However, perl some details are different. where used\\ (and\\) needed, perl only needs (and) without the preceding'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal pre-processor are kept for display and merging. other operations only change the data that the line-line algorythm looks like.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal pre-processor, the line-off preprocessor sees the output of the normal pre-processor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit a lot of files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kblur3; complete folders recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without actually performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... execute selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you just need to open folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, folder 1 will be used as the base. if no target folder is specified, use & knot; Folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically, not merging. to start merging, select the appropriate menu entry or press the F7 key. (see further details.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you will receive a small message about the current progress. if you cancel the scan of the folders, only the files that have been compared to that point will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is complete, displays & knot; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found while scanning is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is normally folded up. you can open a folder by clicking on + / - or double-clicking on the object or by clicking on the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions to open all subdirectories and open all subdirectories with which you can open up all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click on a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail panel to the selected object. in such a case, the merge operation cannot be automatically selected. if the merge is started, you will be informed about any problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the picture above, the colors of red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries, however, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical. then also folders have the same color. for folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then turns yellow and later when it is old, becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copying A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a file and B is a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for syncing is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder has been specified and if the option directories are synced. then select & knot; then select the necessary action so that both folders will be identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filenames for the output file only B; copied directly after merging & kblur3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge (unsure), then check & knot; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy. if the files are different but the same date appears, an error message appears: files are different, but the date is identical.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During merging, one file is executed after the other. it indicates the status column when merging has been successful, and other messages when something unexpected occurred. if merging is completed, you should make a final check and see if the status is alright everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If the file-comparison method is selected for Full analysis in the setup dialog, KDiff3 will display more columns. these contain the number of unresolved, resolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the selected entry (file or odd), or all entries at once. if you have selected all merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have not specified a destination folder, C is used as the target in the three-folder merge mode, B is chosen as destination for two-folders and when synchronizing A and / or B is used as the destination.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check afterwards whether all entries should be in the target folder, also in the folder structure. there are some options that may be skipped by certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the shortcut). to only merge the current entry: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If conflicting file types still exist, a message appears that points to the defective elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box appears with the options passing through, simulating and breaking.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes. you will then get a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; performs certain actions with all entries. if manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you're finished with a file, select Start / continue directory merge or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog appears. then & kdiff3; continue its work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If you click on an error, a message and detailed status information will appear. at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to issue the cause of the problem. if you continue to merge (F7 key), let & kdiff3; you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before you continue to merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been combined individually, you notice & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and do not merge them later. even if the merge operation has been skipped or not saved, these entries are considered settled. only if you change the merge operation, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Settings menu - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory compilation with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. separate the patterns with a semicolon. separate the patterns with a semicolon;. valid wildcards: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h).</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be adjusted specifically with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a default attribute. in other filesystems, a preceding point marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When the option is turned off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is deactivated in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">For links to folders: if the option is turned off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the links will be treated like normal folders and recursively searched. (note that if the option contains a link on itself it would lead to an infinite loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns. (the number of resolved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files that do not contain text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders using a slow network, it might be faster to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The files are considered to be identical if they are equal to size. this can be useful, for example, if the change date has been lost when copying. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Enable the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no target folder is specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected so that both folders are subsequently identical. the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, copying the newer file is proposed as action instead of merging. (this is considered unsafe because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified too. you should check this in any case.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original version will be renamed and will get the extension .orig. If an old backup file with the .orig extension is already existing, it will be deleted without further backup. this also concerns the normal merging of single files, not just the merge whole folder. this option is enabled in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Usually the folder merge view is visible at the merge of single files; you can move the Windows divider with the mouse. if you don't want it, you can disable the Folder & Textwindow from the main window in the Windows menu and switch between the two views by switching between directory and text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You probably prefer to compare a file by double-clicking. however, in the directory menu there is also a corresponding menu item. you can also merge a single file directly without first having to start the folder merge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status will be lost if you re-read the directory: directory menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparencies with the help of KIO-slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open files located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. you should note a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. contained. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, spaces &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link is shown on a file or folder. then, a file is always accepted as a link destination. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or modification date. therefore, the permissions or the date of change vary from the original. (please refer to the option Confidential of the size.) (This is possible only for local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently the difference-viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP starts with the built-in difference viewer first. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In KDiff3Part display from the context menu.</seg>

<seg id="2427">In the konqueror you can click a patch file and select from the Context menu Preview into - KDiffuser Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created.</seg>

<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably didn't tell the configure script to KDE. in the preset, configure is installed in / usr / local, but then KDE can not find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are first treated as identical; however, if only a non-white mark is different, the line is treated as not identical.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this important information is lost when the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort required was too large so far. you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger volumes of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text it is suddenly flushed; No src is left; and the text cannot be deleted. what does this mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missed the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web. thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & knot; you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For a list of the latest changes, see http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the file ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>

<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift-Remove) copies to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-Insert) inserts the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position or replaces the current marker.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only show differences: files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current version of the program, after changes to these options, you need to re-read the Folder with the Update function.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also causes identical files to be copied to the target folder when merging. if the destination folder doesn't already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is disabled in the default folder.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the caption A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed when clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">This option is deactivated in the default setting. for example, understatement in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; displays a mini preview of all virtual workspaces. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the worktops, change their size, stop them or move them. this works in both a desktop and multiple.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual worktops as well as the applications running in it. the applications can be selected and even moved to the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; moving is possible both inside a desktop and on other working surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: when clicked on the empty background of & Kpager; clicked, the context menu has only the two entries pager. if, however, to an application within & Kpager; clicked, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minimize, Maximize, On Desktop and Bee. the commands do the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved within the & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also moved to other work surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is checked, the & Kpager will display the names of the virtual workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field lets you display the & Kpager; display the numbers of the virtual workspaces. if it is crossed together with name, the names are provided with ordinal numbers, & eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is checked, the background of each desktop is also displayed as background im & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is checked, the current programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise only empty working surfaces are displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the windows with their standard icon and Pixmap shows a small view of the actual program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; main window can be determined: classically & Kpager; in a 2xN-grid, as is known from Pager applications in some other window managers; horizontal displays all virtual worktops in a vertical range, which is very well suited for viewing laterally on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be modified in size, view the windows as symbols or with their contents and move them outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager; and then set-up selector buttons... allow the dialog to appear.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulate a mouse click as soon as the mouse cursor has been waiting for a while in the same place. it is meant to help people who suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and who each mouse click pain. furthermore, it can emulate the pulling with the mouse. this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle pain that occurs when you click the mouse and helps many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may also suffer from pain caused by the use of your computer. if you suffer from pain that is not done with your computer's use, you should consult a doctor if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear: even if & kmousetool; avoiding ache that is caused when clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and, as with all the ergonomic tools, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">Using & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and opens a mouse click as soon as you break the movement short.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the smart move activated, makes & kmousetool; a pause after it emulated the pressing of the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the release of the mouse button is executed. in this way, you can do the pulling with pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click navigates.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligent Shifting is enabled, the shooting range is activated (1 / 10 s). here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing the mouse button, wait before releasing the mouse button again if no moving of the mouse takes place.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking with mouse-shift. if this function is activated, a slow moving forward and backward, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click. these movements are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool; the first time is started, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can & kde; move to shorten the reaction time. open the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, select sound system and here the tab General. there is a slider to adjust sound buffer to reduce response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool; launched at each start of & kde; this function is currently only under & kde; available. for GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all settings to the values that have been set when you open the dialog. if you have already pressed the Apply button, the settings will be reset to the level after the last back of the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The best thing is to use & kmousetool; first of all, using presets. in particular, the smart move should be turned off at first. if you get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later take the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; to reduce sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First of all, you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains: clicking on the neutral parts of windows or places in the browser window that does not represent a link does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park the mouse in such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse-ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse-ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to take the mouse ball out. how this happens is different from mouse to mouse. however, it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. dirt and dirt can easily be scratched with a flat blade or fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you use the intelligent move in this case, this means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be interrupted by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens if you use & kmousetool; use another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool; and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cursor in another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor on where you want to have it. however, you park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop, if you want to use a keyboard. thus, accidental moving may not cause unwanted reactions. secure zones for the mouse cursor are & eg; the gray surfaces around the toolbars and menus and the front rows of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with intelligent shove, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart move is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes time before you can handle it. it is very likely to mark text, copy it into the clipboard and insert it again or execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just start using it & kmousetool; instead, select text in the following way: press a mouse click at the end of the text area and press the Shift key while clicking the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouseclick. as a result, every time & kmousetool; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click away. so you know exactly when the shift time begins when intelligent moving.</seg>
<seg id="2524">Um & kmousetool; to be able to use the Xtest extension for & X Window; it should be installed on most system already.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and loudspeakers and is correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; press the mouse button once the mouse cursor is short. this program has been developed for people suffering from RSI syndrome and pain relief.</seg>

<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to normal alerts, messages and text jobs as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently, there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there may be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Briquetting parts replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be provided either as words or as regular expressions. it is provided with pre-defined character chain replacement filters, which allow setting chat-emoticons such as: -) by text or for converting messages from & konversation; or & kmail; in a better intelligible form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; converters use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert XML; from one format to another format. included in & tts; are some XSLT files for translation of & XHTML; contained in SSml.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With subscriber-selection filters, you can send orders depending on the content of the text or the program, which has the text to & ktts; sent to a speaker. for example, if you have set a female voice on the speaker card speaker, you can read text of KDE messages about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied for voice output. if the filter detects that its rules do not apply, it will continue to pass the text to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; notification to & ktts; is sent, it is processed by all activated filters installed on the page below. the editing by the filters takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of normal filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and will not be used. filters are subtracted from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter and the further entries will be displayed below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For set-up filters, you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparative pattern. if these patterns are found in the text, the text will be replaced with the corresponding replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name as you like, it only needs to differ from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Replace. the list is executed from top to bottom in the order shown.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to postpone the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. download a list from a file, the entries from the file are attached to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter will only apply if the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here. click on the button to view a list of languages. you can also select several languages if you press the & Ctrl key at the click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID running programs will get you with the program qdbus;. the & dbus; -numbers must be omitted. if for example & qdbus; the application ID copied-3432, you may only enter copied.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The character chain replace filter is only applied to the text if all the conditions with an entry in the box Diesen filter apply if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">In comparison of words, the character briquetting filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. thus, the words must be limited on both sides by dividing lines (spaces).</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual, you will find no manual for writing regular expressions. however, if you have installed the & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; expressions installed, you can use it in the dialogs Add or Edit as help to connect these expressions. the & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; expressions can be found in the package ambiguls.</seg>
<seg id="2649">XML; Transformer & XML; using XSLT files from a format to another format. XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such transformations. however, it can only be applied to well-formed XML. the xsltproc utility needs to be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Specify the path for the xsltproc program. if xsltproc is reached via the environment variable PATH, also xsltproc is enough.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the language selection filter, you can send text to a specific speaker set up on the speaker card or to a speaker with certain characteristics. for example, you can specify that texts by kmail should be read by a female voice. see.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktops; there is a text to the filter, it searches for a narrator for the text. the speaker is selected using the speaker properties that the program provides, which sends the text to & ktts; sends it, and the characteristics of the speakers established on the cartridge board. with the speech selection filter, you can overwrite the chosen speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter will be applied if the text contains the regular expression. is installed on your system of the & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions, you can call it with one click on the button to get help in typing.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To get faster processing, try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e. start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Specify the characteristics of the speaker you want. if the text meets the filter conditions shown above, the speaker is selected to match the desired requirements. click on the button on the right to show the dialog box selector.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your speech settings or to delete all settings.</seg>
<seg id="2657">The language selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen filter if applicable. you must enter at least one condition.</seg>

<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code from & ktts; from the source code archive for dictum, or downloaded the currently created tarball every night, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before using & Desktop, first check if speech synthesizer works correctly with your speech synthesizer. you can use the shell script spd-conf to do this.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktts; the program kttmsgr will be developed in such a way that the set-up of speech dispatchers is possible directly and the script spd-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text will be decomposed into individual sentences. the user can go back sentence or substitution, repeat, pause, or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application gives text to & ktts, it can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output. if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender is female, it will be used, otherwise the best suitable speaker is chosen. if you want to learn more about how & ktats; select a speaker, you will see in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click Add to Add to the list of speakers, and in order to add a speaker to the list, or click Edit, the cartridge speaker setup will be displayed. for example, in the following, the setup of the module for Festival Interactive is shown. for details on the modules, see below.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to the festival is included in PATH, you only need to enter the festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the character encoding for text that is passed to Festival. with voices, the & ktts; known, this setting will be done automatically. in general, Western languages use ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">These slide controls adjust the volume, speech speed, and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select some knob and display this gray, the voice you choose does not allow these settings to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices such as MultiSyn voices require several seconds to be loaded due to their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD, so that the first set is synthesized faster (with greater memory consumption).</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet set up a speaker (or click Apply to Apply).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window will be displayed ktmgr on the start of ktronmgr. otherwise, only the symbol ktronmgr in the system section is visible, but not the program window. click the icon in the system section to display the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is selected and ktmgr does not run yet, it will appear in the system area once KTTSD reads a text. thus, you have the possibility to stop reading or otherwise control.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here all orders in the queue are listed, along with the application that has set the order, the current status of the order, the number of sentences and the precisely edited set. the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column ID on the mapping speaker.</seg>

<seg id="2702">The list of ALSA devices includes all PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system. most of them will not work. you will have to find out which device works with you. in doubt choose Standard.</seg>
<seg id="2703">On this card you can set up special actions that are executed whenever the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority. & ktts; processes four types of speech applications:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other jobs and holds these orders. once the output of the screen reader has been read, the retained jobs are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next highest priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is subject to hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will resume after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News is the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks news. if you read & eg; just read a long text on a web page, you can talk with & kmouth; nevertheless someone who just steps into space.</seg>
<seg id="2707">A text assignment is interrupted by a message, warning or output of a screen reader, adds & ktts; the audio output to the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both the introductory sound and the introductory message are active, the introductory sound is played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this tab only apply to normal text jobs. there are no special actions for messages, warnings and the editions of screen readers if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To read Knotfy messages, start kttsmgr and click Notifications. the list menu pops up.</seg>
<seg id="2711">Select this check box to add & kde; Notify Notifications. if this setting is not selected, the other settings are deactivated and & ktts; do not read alerts.</seg>
<seg id="2712">If this setting is selected, notifications with which a sound is played out will not be read by & ktons; not pre-read.</seg>
<seg id="2713">Use these buttons to add or delete events to the list. if you click the Add button, a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list.</seg>

<seg id="2716">Use this drop-down selector to specify what you should do when an event occurs. you have the following choices:</seg>
<seg id="2717">If you have selected user-defined text, enter the desired text. you can use the following placeholders:</seg>
<seg id="2718">You can enter the characteristics of the desired speaker here. standard selects the speaker, which is shown in the list on the list of speakers as the top entry. see also.</seg>
<seg id="2719">Note that there are three levels for events. if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application, it is executed. otherwise, the action is executed for all other events of the particular application.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSml) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output. this standard contains trademarks for controlling voice, speech speed, volume, sex of voice and pitch. also marks for controlling the pronunciation of voice and pitch. SSml is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktts; only partially and only in the basic functions. the following restrictions are present:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (british male) as this is the default voice, the festival uses the output of SSml.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100%, the SSml text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>
<seg id="2726">&lt;! [CDATA [&lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; &lt;! Doctype speak PUBLIC "- / / W3C / / DTD Synthesis 1.0 / / EN" "http: / / www.w3.org / TR / speech synthesis" &gt; "Who has slept in my bed?" asked the bear child.]] &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and set-level detection filters (SDB filters). SBDs do not divide text into single phrases. this allows you to start / stop or pause on the first set, as only the first set can be synthesized, even if the speech synthesizer does not support this directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the propositional distinctions filter. at the first start of & ktts; as default, a set limit detection filter is set up automatically. you can change its settings or add other set limit detection filters, but beginners will get discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn the selection of speakers is by trying out. turn on the choice of speakers and select text to read. change the selection of speakers, change some features and check how the speaker selection changes. of course, you have to set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktops; then you can start reading faster, because only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block, which can take a long time,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can pause or abort text jobs on the file card, even if the speech synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set-level detection filter is automatically set up when you start ttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Punctuation filters compare text with a regular expression for propositions and add a tabulator character (decimal code 8) at the set limits (tabulator characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering). note that the default punctuation filter retains the character set.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (kwavelength), warnings, messages, or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal set limit detection filter by mistake, you can insert it again by loading the standard _ sbdrc file contained in & ktats.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the menu language selection menu, you can override the language settings for the application. the card card is displayed if</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top of the cartridge speaker). in other words, no speaker characteristics are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most suitable speaker, having all the characteristics of a speaking speaker. if you do not delete or edit the speaker settings, select & ktts; otherwise select & ktt; the speaker that best matches the originally set characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the characteristics of the desired speaker here. if this property does not matter, do not give anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Check this check box if the property is to take precedence over other properties. you can also set several markers here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since language is a critical factor in publishing output, it is always considered a priority property. you will rarely use this feature. the only case where you possibly want to specify the attribute language is when you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the features in the speaker area, which is most likely to delete the following, click on the Default Speaker select button and then use the speaker that matches the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case 0 stands for the last word order in the queue. you can also specify a order number. (without order number the input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr crashes when it starts. I compiled Debug support, but I don't get any trace back.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crash and & Desktop; you probably need to register GStreamer yet. with GStreamer 0.8.x, you probably need to register GStreamer. if the problem is not resolved, it may be an uncompatible version of GStreamer installed. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output of ALSA does not work when I play music simultaneously with another application. if I hold a text order, freeze & ktts; a. on the & console; a message that says: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, there is the problem that conflicts occur at ALSA, which prevent simultaneous opening of several PCM devices. for possible solutions please visit the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have uploaded an additional voice for festival from the Internet. I have installed them and can use them in festival but ktehmgr does not display this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Then add the new voice in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / tgrub / vocals file. as a guide, you can use the other entries. if that is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL; where you have found the voice, to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">There is a setting speed on the audio card audio. in order for this to work, the program must be installed sox and can be discoverable via the environment variable PATH. some synthesizer modules such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed on the cartridge board for speaker setup. depending on the selected voice, it is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speech speed are ignored if & ktats; & HTML; pre-reads. (this is because the HTML is converted into SSml;) Deactivate either the filter for converting & HTML; by & XML; (see) or, if you are quite brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSml reformerfilter, and set up the speech speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't manage to read web pages with a female voice. I have set up a female festival speaker, but & ktts; reads the web pages with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">With Festival 1.95 beta, the day Sable GENDER does not seem to work. so that the festival does not produce any errors, the xsl file will accuse to converting SSml to Saber the GENDER tags. the same applies to the VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added my own character chain replacement filter and now I can go back and back in & ktops. on the caricenter's jobs it is displayed, the order consists of only one set. what do I do wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">You must not filter punctuation marks (point, question marks, exclamation marks, comma and semicolon) instead. instead, use a filter for set limit detection for these characters instead.</seg>
<seg id="2757">Alsa (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). Alsa is installed on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or later. note: make sure the modules are registered for GStreamer by using GStreamer in & ktts; run the command post-register. (HTTP: / / gstreamer.freedestop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users experience conflicts in audio output in connection with ALSA. if your system also counts, you can not simultaneously play music and read a text. & ktts; also freezes when you hold a text order and then start another. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the ALSA (dmix) website.</seg>
<seg id="2760">As of July 2005, aKode does not support any real pauses. if you hold a text assignment in & ktts, the current set will be read more verbose.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The audio program sox is used for the general setting of the speech speed, but otherwise it is not necessary. Debian users can install it with the command apt-get install sox. the program is included on most & Linux; CDs already included.</seg>
<seg id="2762">If you download & ktts; as tarball (with tar filled archive), log in as normal user and unzip the tarball into a suitable folder. switch to this folder and enter the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2763">In & kde; 4 the module & arts; probably removed or at least created on request.</seg>
<seg id="2764">The following modules for voice synthesizers are created by default. some of them have runtime dependency of non-free software. (non-free according to Debian distribution policies).</seg>
<seg id="2765">Default is & ktts; in / opt / kde3 installs. if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $KDEDIRS, you must specify as an option --prefix = target. for example</seg>

<seg id="2767">CD dictionecho kttsd &gt; inst-apps make -f Makefile.cvs. / configure cd's make su make install</seg>
<seg id="2768">Before using & Desktop, check first if your voice synthesizer works properly. follow the instructions that you have received with the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers whose source code is exposed. the quality of the voices is generally good, and several voices and languages are supported.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You need to install at least one language. you will find help in the instructions provided with Festival. if you want to read web pages, you must install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. German voices are subject to restrictions on sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This voice presupposes festival 1.95 beta or later. the voice is still in an early stage of development. unzip the software in festival / lib / vocals / russian /. if you set up the Russian voices, you must enter for the voices MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. select a Cyrillic (8-bit) encoding as for example koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">Festival is usually included in the & Linux distributions. therefore, look for the festival first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use Polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the encoding option must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetwork.conf, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; that allows the administration of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolCenter; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated interface. the & kcontrolCenter; can be called by selecting K Menu _ controlCenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package has been designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & knetwork.conf file; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in the & kcontrolcenter are displayed; the module network settings (knetwork.conf;) can be started by selecting the kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network Network Setting in & KMenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetwork.conf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured, so & knetwork.conf; the device at all indicates and allows setting of network features.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed and installed for the installation of & Linux. if network devices are added later, the drivers need to be loaded by customizing the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings module is loaded when the option network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; index is selected. when starting the module's network settings, this attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be identified, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform to choose from the list that best matches the distribution and release date. by selecting the setting of non-resetting questions the setting can be durably hit. the next start of the network settings will then automatically preset this selection.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. before, all options are displayed gray, meaning the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. in the system management mode, you can click the button System Administrative mode at the bottom of the module at the bottom of the module. it is required to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The network interface tab is used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the Rider Network Interface:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings displayed on displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button interface... set up in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the automatic selection, TCP / IP settings are taken from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, TCP / IP settings for the system are simultaneously started with the start of the system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all required TCP / IP information at every system start, so no further setting is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP, according to the system, can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection of manuals without DHCP or BOOTP, the TCP / IP configuration can be made. in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field network mask, the subnet mask must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this option is selected, the system initializes the network interface during boot. if initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. ping in the & console; you can see if the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off as required. switching on an off-off network device is activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or turned off as required. switch off an enabled network device by selecting from the list and deactivating the interface...</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the host's IP address in the local subnet, which conveys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with machines in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the computer calls http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS triggers this name in an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution part of the name resolution is a simple way to manage this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS entries can be placed in the list by selecting an entry and / or downgrading in the list with the buttons Hindered or Herunder.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking on the button Add... from the group machine for name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will display the New Name Server dialog.</seg>

<seg id="2825">The list Namely known hosts describes hostname-to-IP address links for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used for booting when no DNS servers are available. in small, closed networks it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally, the list Namely known hosts contains some entries, which support & apos; localhostapos; and support some special IPv6 addresses. this version of IP still in the test is intended to replace version 4 in future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add.... Add New Alias dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the familiar host and click Add the Add button. if the familiar calculator has multiple alias names, press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a name known by name from the list and select Edit.... The Condiator Constant Calculator will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be executed one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the Network Settings module are not immediately effective in the system. to activate the changes, the following command must be set in a & Console.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetwork.conf is http: / / knetwork.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is enough if & kde; and Qt installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the fully compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with a graphical interface, such as kpackage or the installation tool of its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not, but in addition, the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only by experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetwork.conf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology will be given, and in the second, all of the & knetwork.conf configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP Version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never been widely used. IPv6 is expected to be propagated in the near future. therefore, this description is currently focused on the common IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, at the & eg; Workplace, the network administrator is the contact person who is running a valid IP address or if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a particular area reserved for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not relayed on the Internet, therefore their use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks addresses are mostly used in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 machines.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all computers are participants in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = the own machine). the default route is needed for IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The net address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to its own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This section contains the configuration files that are affected by & knetwork.conf, and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed with DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if there is a different content in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is well known that this file is scanned by the scripts in SuSE. another stand than expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape. the first thing was to create a surface for tar, which furthermore offered the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective packing. the second aim was to answer a question that my wife asked: how much longer does it take when one secures?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be used by & kdat. it can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; split the tape back and read the pre-tensioning information of the band. recognise & kdat; the preload on the tape not, you will be asked if the band should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognises & kdat; the preload, searches for the appropriate index on your plate. if this cannot be found, you will be asked if the band index is to be newly created.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been integrated. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the volume of the tape can now be searched by the entry of the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; gives a corresponding message in the status bar by changing the symbol for the tape and shows in the status bar a corresponding message. the tape can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & kdat; it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A tape type must be formatted before you can be used to store data. this process does not correspond to formatting at & kdat; if your tape drive requires that a tape can be formatted before use, it must be formatted. floppy tape drives usually require formatting of tape, DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity & kdat; with the formatting of the tape away. all data on the tape are lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. it can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only backup this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select Save...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been initiated, the dialog will open for backup. in this dialog, you can even check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings dialog, the Save dialog appears. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including data rate and time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Mark the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click on one of the archives and select the menu item to check....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure has been started, the dialog appears for review. in this dialog, you can even check your selection and change the work folder for verification.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for the review, the dialog appears to check. this dialog shows the progress of the exam process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can restore the restore, the files that should be restored must be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive. it will only restore the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the files and / or subfolders are restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore in the menu....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been started, the dialog appears for recovery. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">When you confirm the settings for restoration, dialog will restart. this dialog shows the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re-create the band index file based on the band content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can re-create the index in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This will create a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all files listed under backup files, only the files contained in the same file system are backed up to the same file system as the folder. folders that are on other file systems can be stored separately in backup files. each entry is viewed by tar regardless of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">To determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and created a new snapshot file for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; and lt; files have not been fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set up using the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding version of the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & dat; before the tape is included, the command will load to the drive. for some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, try & kdat; to block the ejection in the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work for all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, when loosening the integration of & kdat, the band is automatically ejected. do not use this option with Floppy-Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; change the hardwary block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you need to share the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is hostname: seconds, where host name is the full name of the system on which the tape has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time in which the tape has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat folder.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup tape. this symbol is only active when a tape is included.</seg>

<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users access fast access to information about problems that occur on their server. and ksystemlog; therefore, tries to provide some advanced features to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of protocol files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; functions available, with which the protocol-lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorted. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start, and ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - will open. it will not show you this, and it opens up instead of a small news window, so you have & ksystemlog; very likely do not start with system administrator privileges. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the / var / log, for the normal user normally do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion or the input strings. in the default setting, the list of the log lines will be displayed automatically, so that only log lines will be displayed. in the default setting, a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can, of course, select another entry. the string of the filter search term is then matched only with the entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the System protocol, select the column process, and in the filter bar, select the name of a process, so show & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that were sent or created from this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol rows. protocol rows of the level errors are displayed with a more obvious color than protocol lines of the level indication. the colored representation of protocol rows can be switched off alignment dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you only want to show a particular process (for example in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can be useful, for example, if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use filter strip.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can enable the option to jump to new lines in the main window context menu to view all the new additions to the protocol.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own webpage on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. There you will find further information about the sources of ksystemlog;</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion Archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; -archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv;. this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init is quickly becoming the standard for the control of the program start when operating the system in the & Linux; world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for every system service you want to start when you start up the system or change to another runtime. system services do not include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, but system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only launched once. such calls are made to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be in / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if you don't have much use of it. you can also make a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in different places after the program init and starts the first that it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runtime is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see in the starting area a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default Runlevel 3 is 3. if you want to change it then you can edit / etc / inittab from hand and change the 3. if you have brought something together then you come to repair it by restarting the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry is a shortcut to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts manually from the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script will be called with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the start argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; have a server running level that runs just httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; in addition, I could also have a user Runtime, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or any other pointing device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between runleveln or change the position within a level by moving it elsewhere. this happens only if they remove an entry from the area of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved when you move them to a new area. to copy them only to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select Edit or from the context menu and paste it into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sort number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you will need to edit the sort numbers of the surrounding records before attempting to add the system service again.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: at present, there is no way to restore entries thrown in the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tabulator key to activate the different work areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another runlevel, move it with trimming to the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the input button to open the Properties dialog. use the Tabulator button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they will be saved by & ksysv. changes to the default settings will be saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard runleveln, and now the machine is constantly restarting. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single-user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard running level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; to run under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions makes configuring the proprietary alignment programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution, please check that all configuration files are present, which are required by the respective system service (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) simply terminate without notice if their configuration files are not present or false.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, may even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about the running level so that they can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it's enough to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After making changes, you need to save them. either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or the save save in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two flashcards, the user and the user group list. to edit select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry. it appears the user and group properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only when you have enabled space constraints (quota) for users will create a flashcard where you can make individual settings. additional flashcards may appear if Shadow Passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD universities.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password management card appears if shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD universities.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if space restriction (quota) is activated and initialized for at least one integrated filesystem (discernible at the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here, parameters can be changed for each user, where the space limitations are in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current file system is selected using the field file system with limited space limitation.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The groups inform about the group belonging to the selected user. the standard group to which the user belongs can be found in the field Primaries Group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, mark this user on the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Adding from the user or group menu or click the appropriate add button in the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group is similar.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO bootloader, add, remove and modify the boot password, change the time up to the boot of the standard operating system, add the default operating system, remove, change, change operating systems, remove, change and more.</seg>
