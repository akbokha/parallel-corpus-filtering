although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time now .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American authors and practi@@ sed his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican L@@ etter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter , who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate , who wanted to fill the highest federal court with judges who were interested in his interest .
I was trapped .
free from Method Man , &quot; I was as if it was the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the U.S. only intensified .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are , and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very black@@ ish love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
a lot has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me , as he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
with his mind he never stops behind the mountain as one says so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague put it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can prim@@ aries was the highest number ever reached by the party nom@@ ine@@ e .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ?
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix .
for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program that welcomes people from all over the world , a deeply beli@@ ever person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
also , Tr@@ ump@@ y Wel@@ tan@@ schau@@ ung did not agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tr@@ umps In@@ tolerance also contrasts with the gener@@ osity I experienced with Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fought the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she still adap@@ ts to Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es &apos;s commitment , which always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump made his way to the nom@@ ine@@ e Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
it turned out , however , that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white people , gave the presi@@ dency to a man , despite - or perhaps precisely because of his contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to design@@ ate the tr@@ ump @-@ voters as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation .
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their worries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that those voters , of whom the majority know , have voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comment@@ ates on the cruel decision to raise a man looking down on those who look different from him .
this &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( O.@@ B. T ) : as much as &quot; white against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; pu@@ n of white in reference to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means much like a whi@@ p lash , as the great Van Jones called , exactly killed what America has done so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background you may have , America means everyone welcome .
for this country elected as its President , twice the son of an Ken@@ yan , whose story , as he himself says , would not be possible anywhere else in the world .
with the election of Donald Tr@@ ump@@ , however , there is a vast majority of the white America on this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan in@@ quired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices heard lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone not like you have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and vo@@ ci@@ d &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded by saying : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , that &apos;s not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son had fallen sent a message to him .
this is now tr@@ umps country , said the news .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , couldn &apos;t find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from misery to stars : these Latin American children do not let their love of music be destroyed by rub@@ b@@ ish .
the &quot; Recy@@ cled Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican Music School of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero Community in O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura together ?
that the music played in both places has not only changed the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with rub@@ b@@ ish
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill site , only 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen .
for several years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music band ) plays in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and ban@@ al violence .
but after a coinci@@ dental encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare hope of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI writes :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laughing and with shining eyes and play in the bu@@ stle you learn to play trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ es , bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from rub@@ b@@ ish
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay &apos;s capital - play on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ prepared instruments made up of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recy@@ cl@@ ers under management of Fa@@ vio Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez began to turn parts of waste into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , contra@@ b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all of which were made of rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music from the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the early days :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage . children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed when Fa@@ vio was shown something he had never seen before : a violin produced from waste .
today there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments of re@@ processed material and which is called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentation called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic MÃ¼ll@@ de@@ pon@@ ie ) records the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world generates approximately one billion tons of waste each year .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
land fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of rub@@ b@@ ish @-@ to @-@ music all around the world .
the orchestra played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and teamwork can successfully combat illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
re @-@ publishing takes place as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
in West Africa it was known back then that this ship had already been fishing illegal fishing in Liberia &apos;s waters before it visited the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were correspon@@ dingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal off@@ ence of this species on its coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ores , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles were quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to take one of their har@@ bours and refused to give him a fishing license .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to do everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fisheries authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : he was not able to catch fish there .
ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for pil@@ lage of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which cris@@ sc@@ ros@@ ses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries set up in 2012 by the NGO stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( stop illegal fishing ) .
alongside Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries who had then expelled the prime minister from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and face each other where there is illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers technical support for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can damage ecos@@ ystems which have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the s@@ nail &apos;s pace with information between individual countries , actions are happening in real time , trace@@ able to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communications platform .
there the individual countries can exchange , for example , lists of existing licenses , news on susp@@ icious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in prohibited areas . also , suspect routes can be discovered - such as those indicating that a ship loads his caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license , where they were on the way and possibly , if they have a criminal record .
on the basis of this information , countries that are against illegal fishing may refuse to accept such vessels in their ports . meaning that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay for pun@@ ish@@ ments , such as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is then about significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is not profitable anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to recover an estimated 20 million USD of lost turnover , which lost the eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network every year due to the illegal fish@@ ers entering East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries , thus attracting the region &apos;s commercial fishing from all over the world . among these illegal fishing companies .
its practices include , among other things , actions such as sailing under false flag , fake license papers , imag@@ inations , fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they purpos@@ efully use the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an un@@ brid@@ led control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole attempts to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the closed front has been working so far .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ icious ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found escap@@ ing ships .
based on its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that helps F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate susp@@ icious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to detect the illegal vessels that are happy to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a NGO that also deals with fisher@@ y data and offers technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , switch off their automatic identification systems , which cannot be ordered by satellites .
this is why Cop@@ eland helps build a system that connects different levels of information . it is intended to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i find crimin@@ ally acting ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has launched the Global Fishing Watch platform , together with Google and the Oce@@ ana Marine Protection Organization , a platform that offers satellite data and which can display the position of each track@@ able vessel anywhere in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors , to get a better picture of who is doing what , that makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project in which a global system allows the pursuit of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only det@@ ecting criminals but also deter@@ ring them .
ships that previously f@@ ished without a license and hardly had to reck@@ on with consequences now know they are being observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have meanwhile registered a 33 % increase in fishing net sales since fis@@ her boats buy more lic@@ ences .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to detect Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tow@@ ing nets , whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become a study object &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are now fighting illegal fishing , according to the exact same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With security , the aim is to develop even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia must report its first big triumph : in October it introduced Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under false flag . and not only was the ship on the road without a license and were used tow @-@ nets which are now forbidden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship had also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 is a strong sign that they act against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a special , collaborative way of working towards the protection of the oceans actually works across the world ocean . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London .
her articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela escal@@ ates further : demonstrations in several cities aiming to &quot; rec@@ ap@@ ture the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are regarded as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro &apos;s official inaugur@@ ation .
this picture of Mar@@ Ã­a Ale@@ j@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a close @-@ up of the demonstration in Mar@@ ac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 .

after the government of Venezuela rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on the im@@ pe@@ achment , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country went into empt@@ iness by assembling on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the recovery of Venezuela ) , pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - in the low@@ lands of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ de@@ an regions of MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a , in the centrally located federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country is steadily deterior@@ ating , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the inaugur@@ ation of the current president Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , but in the end the reluct@@ ance of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , Con@@ tri@@ but@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summari@@ zes the context of the government decision in its latest article :
in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , where inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the end of the year ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to rec@@ ap@@ ture its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the election alliance Mass@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ Ã¡@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( like a round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces , called on the demonstr@@ ators to take part in the elections of 2015 to the majority of representatives of the opposition .
the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on 3 November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures of the mar@@ ches , which are published in real time , testify , among other things , an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also disputes with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most frequently shared images shows a prot@@ esters calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cried the Venezu@@ el@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter , images that tell of disputes , as well as reports of oppression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , are pil@@ ing up on Twitter .
particularly large waves beat the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government according to their own statement .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State of T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a don &apos;t wear skir@@ ts because otherwise you could see something that many National Gu@@ ards don &apos;t have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic makes the round that trains the scale of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the claim following an official inaugur@@ ation process - it was now demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .

Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of signatures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your release !
on the road !
others are evaluating these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government which , from their point of view , has done little against the devastating economic crisis and has preferred to refrain from critical voices :
they took us so much - but also fear !
mar@@ ches are increasing more and more in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans told the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike rather than to work or go shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news site .
the interview was translated into English and is published with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities committed in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine city of CÃ³r@@ doba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testi@@ fied against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial in the province of CÃ³r@@ doba .
the trial ended on 24 August 2016 for crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
starting with the burden to carry the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
he kept family secrets for 34 years .
in the situation at that time I believed that this was okay .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child of 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time , I could not realise that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer .
Luis Alberto was no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gendar@@ mer@@ ie . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 to 1978 , at La Per@@ la prison .

this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who was charged with kidn@@ apping in 15@@ 8 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who over the years recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy and who testi@@ fied before a Federal Constitutional Court against his own father .
his story shows the great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and called on me to identify my boy@@ friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have made yourself friends with an ERP environment .
pass only on , that they will not guide you one day and I will have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Argent@@ inian revolutionary workers &quot; party .
therefore he banned me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it would be ok . for so my father had educated me .
on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all kinds of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

the prisoners are tortured ,
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - all in 1976 .
on the first and last time he was waiting for me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he commanded me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible - stood .
all of it was stolen .
he gave me a little package wrapped in a blanket and commanded me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen items were put off and stopped me with a guard post .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
I looked in , and saw a couch that was tortured by men .
she looked like a cot and metal feathers .
later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who had just been tied up there .
they seldom fast@@ ened a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it over with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty vi@@ le .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible for someone to do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied up with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and became eye @-@ band@@ ages .
he spoke with &quot; Chu@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people lay down with the face down - all were tied at hands and feet .
near the entrance , people chew@@ ed quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father saw that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit , and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me about it at home .
beside La Cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms that were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to survivors Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , sentenced the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , conduc@@ ts the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way in which the kidn@@ app@@ ings came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be reloc@@ ated .
this was the lie - euph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; war boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things home .
at that time at the age of old I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was myself at the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war boot@@ y is a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military signs , which one takes from an enemy that has been fought .

but if you go into a house and the fridge , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to inv@@ ade a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my dad could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You who st@@ ole cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you &apos;re not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded rage , struck me and shou@@ ted :
if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
so my father was .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photograph of that back then , on which I wore a jacket and a roll collar shirt out of wool . both had my dad from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes to his home .
at that time , the defense accused me of being a co @-@ author of this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay me a burden on what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to testify .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disappearance of the body is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now that I &apos;m older , I feel regret .
I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you executed people during the dictatorship , but why did the dead bodies disappear ?
why kid@@ ding children ?
one day my father brought a girl with her mother , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
they could have been put into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why would their bodies disappear ?
did these people not have families whom one could hand over their mortal remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a man .
my father told me when democracy was re @-@ introduced , they fet@@ ched machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but something always remains .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the idea of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him alle@@ gations about all the atro@@ cities I had to witness on his behalf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I killed nobody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked me why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they allegedly defended were actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have done terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to take part in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I made the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can blame me for being bi@@ ased . I have finally said against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 before the end of the trial .

the Jud@@ g@@ ments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the sentence in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims in August .
43 subjects were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court punished lifel@@ ong imprisonment and in nine cases prison sentences between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ it@@ ees .
eleven of the original 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ gger : murder , torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ sex state terrorism
all defend@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian personnel .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was ab@@ duc@@ ted together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he directed the following words to the silence chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , an Argent@@ ine@@ an organization founded in 1995 , H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the process took more than three years , but the research for this took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government transferred the country to which La Per@@ la was located , so that there could be a memorial set up by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error in a center in Kyoto , where you can pro@@ long your driver &apos;s license .
the photo was distributed in the social media .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long their driver &apos;s license , last month witnessed a particularly mis@@ lucky translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese word was found on a shield , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older car driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - perhaps also with an evil h@@ ind and # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been widely shared in social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto @-@ based daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto , simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the er@@ ron@@ eous English translation was first removed . the designation &quot; horrible drivers &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , albeit gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct designation &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police of Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported the ap@@ ology as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that elderly people felt offen@@ ded by inadequate correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online intelligence service J @-@ C@@ ast News addressed a little more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents across the country are a cause for concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , in 2005 , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased their share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has increased in the same period .
in the article published on Yahoo , the named re@@ porter brought comments to the light showing which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently he@@ w against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo regarding the translation error was , among other things , the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So faulty is the translation really not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread all over Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre errors in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the starting text and active language skills in order to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires the active command of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general , the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the source language - should be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English .
photo by Fli@@ ckr user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their mother tongue , who could translate the translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of the translation , cost estim@@ ation or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese .
some companies that do not have foreign employees can still make translations internally . then , the Japanese employee , whose English language is considered the best , is the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are .
photo by Fli@@ ckr user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
the confused and enig@@ matic sentences generated by machine translation have shown that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time . this applies especially to some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the enig@@ matic prints , which often decorate t @-@ shirts or bags , are used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood .

translation errors may be acceptable or at least inno@@ cu@@ ous as jewellery . but from large companies or government which have the means to ensure higher standards , more careful translations can be expected .
in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully make use of a more serious source for its translations .
Venezuela : taking protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ eed con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users announced that they would not have access to Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online trans@@ mit@@ ters .
other users later wrote that the internet appearances of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV are no longer accessible .
other online trans@@ mit@@ ters also carried out recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as which were organized by opposition groups opposing the government Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests began in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the connection was sn@@ apped and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Zen@@ it : enables your VPN .
it seems that websites of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are once again blocked .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net site .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of tur@@ mo@@ il .
traditional media have been reluct@@ ant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission regarded this as a &quot; call to force . &quot;
I have registered with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net without cable TV and informative national TV channels .
it is astonishing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ S@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible due to a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online trans@@ mit@@ ters . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly delegates its meetings .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers answer requests for specific domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server responds poorly or refuse to request such a website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ .de
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the broadcast was suspended on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Fl@@ ores , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was arrested .
Fl@@ ores was beaten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multimedia reporting on current events in the country more and more difficult .
in Paraguay , many girls will be ens@@ la@@ ved to receive education
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ n as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and ga@@ thers testim@@ onies of other Cri@@ mean tas , as they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a cur@@ ative report published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , deca@@ ying schools &quot; ) , edited and re @-@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family living there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation from university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one from which something has become &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as a Cri@@ adi@@ n for the family . in Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls were forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money passes their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another , more rich family . in exchange , the child gets food , an education and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned is that children must pay countless days of domestic work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be aboli@@ shed .
this practice called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a couple of years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ mean tas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that Cri@@ mean tas is ino@@ cul@@ ated guarantees in general silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , the family who is their daughter in the belief that they complete their education , improve their position in society and can &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; can be handed over to another family .
on the other hand , the family who assimil@@ ates the girl with her and justi@@ fies its exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be star@@ ved .
victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn about it many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 there was a relatively unknown phenomenon occurring in the hidden in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed signs of violent blows .
she was 14 years old .
she was in the household of the former military hospital Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Population Register .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra stayed with a stick on Mar@@ Ã­n until she suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ n .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela took responsibility for the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society , for the death of the girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modern form of slavery &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several dozen people gathered for protest demonstrations and demanded that there be &quot; no more Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without documents it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children un@@ punished .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations called for a swift investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ n .
when the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be landmark - for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ mean
the Cri@@ mean tas are exploited not only as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the far@@ bik party in which her father worked , had to bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to work all the time and began selling sweets on the street or on the market in order to earn money .
but they all went further to the school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n as a Cri@@ adi@@ n .
in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
she had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer .
on Fri@@ days for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more it was done with learning , the more free time she had .
but even this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but also didn &apos;t have unlimited meals . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the master &apos;s library as food from the fridge , &quot; she recalls .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iser of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on some evenings , the master of the house Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand next to him and read edi@@ tori@@ als from opposition newspapers such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade her not to believe in the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the owner had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family because they believed that I would learn &quot; bad habits &quot; again . &quot; they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of the Guaran@@ i , would again speak to their mother tongue Guaran@@ Ã­ at home .
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made for them , she explains .
but she was perfectly clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
also in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a has been discri@@ minated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never talked about is bul@@ lying and the har@@ ass@@ ment that Cri@@ mean tas are exposed to when they go to school .

hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please contact us .
starting from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the village Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman , who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the third comment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the hear@@ tland that wants to work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was written . &quot; &quot; &quot;

bill writes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians have recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulating the use and use of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it is adopted by Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a job would then be set up to give citizens permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register their correct names and ID numbers on the website of the site to use social networks .
failure to do so could result in a punishment of up to six months in prison or a fine of fin@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bill consisting of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ sed in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent defines social media as &quot; any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video and text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is accepted as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should account for users the registration . unclear is also how they should account for those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul S@@ att@@ ar , MP and suppor@@ ter of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password from the telec@@ om ministry &quot; to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall at the national level around Facebook . due to them it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to file information on their identity to access the network .
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research techn@@ ologist ( in German ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt strongly about the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces , they could also be done online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I take them seriously , it means they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter out citizens who apply for permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a trial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but everything is possible in Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in Parliament and constitutional committees before it comes to the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether his acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military mentality in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and will ensure that no dis@@ sent@@ ing nar@@ ration is present on the scene , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a legal action against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long prison sentence was envis@@ aged for those who are found guilty of threatening the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest to protest . &quot;

high up in the mountains of the Kurdist@@ an region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal prot@@ ector H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Per@@ si@@ can leop@@ ard .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of leop@@ ards that goes through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered because of Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of its habitat .
why is this particular kind of leop@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian leop@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to actually see a Persian leop@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video shows that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a passion@@ ately enjoys a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wildlife and educational programmes of Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 it has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to establishing protective zones for wildlife in the Kurdist@@ an area .

at the beginning of March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the head @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , has progres@@ sed to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a huge earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an nuclear accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was one of several pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring coun@@ ties Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated by sev@@ ens , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had all coastal towns disappear from the map .
for this reason , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture has experienced a nuclear accident , even so , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from a local perspective which progress has been made six years later in order to rebuild the lives of the local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authorities and survey results of those concerned themselves .
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of planned replacement houses ( for the most ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i experienced the greatest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , and 80 percent of the planned spare houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses while Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma represents 70 percent of the total light .
however , even six years after the catastrophe , Ev@@ acu@@ ated dormit@@ ories ( for the most part , cas@@ et@@ su ri@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were reloc@@ ated to final replacement houses .
after the thre@@ ef@@ old disaster , nearly 80@@ ,000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate still lived in such homes .
almost 40 percent of those who were ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent .
the status of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper found out , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , affected by disaster , opened their doors by December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later it is clear that industrial re@@ building in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while almost 100 per cent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are in operation again , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resum@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident occurred extensively in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural lands , with only 66 percent of farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of the farm@@ land destroyed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the nuclear lock zone .
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has largely recovered , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far away .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent on the same level as before disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show up to 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coast inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their living .
is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to be able to determine the overall picture , the newspaper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and under the ev@@ ac@@ uation system . she asked her about the status of reconstruction and how her indign@@ ation changed from the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in their introduction to the article K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to find out more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed find that there was still not enough of disaster prevention .
as it stands for those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma
in its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation people from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the huge earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma was also a witness of the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever had to experience .
of 160@@ ,000 ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 000 people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside of the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been res@@ ett@@ led into permanent replacement houses .
after the 2017 stand still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma live outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation centres in the disaster areas are older than 50 years old . it is known that the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often sees that one connects more than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we are watching these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat subjects that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who recall a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten up by the police in nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . publication with permission .
right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer had struck him against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia . millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity measures throughout the country .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studies social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated him on Saturday and moved him to an artificial coma .
his condition is regarded as critical .
the local journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly within a few days in Brazil .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a bat@@ on . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from active service until the end of the investigation .
the pictures show the police officers , as he suggests in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his bat@@ on on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be seen on TV for six months and the entire suppression would be justified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ali@@ z@@ ador &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video taken by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the network in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs quickly rush to him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective is also immersed in social networks .
in the clip shown below , you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the Mat@@ eus family living in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a portion of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ ana while he is in hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experiences a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father because he supported the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App @-@ group was killed , only to crimin@@ alize teachers , and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who is on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a polic@@ eman who struck him with a bat@@ on .
police Gri@@ ps
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only country in Brazil where there was brutal police operation against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
police officers were at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators built a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Pe@@ as@@ ant Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country .
once again , the Brazilian media ignored road protests by turning the focus on another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; specifically reported a broken glass window to illustrate with a photo their front pages illustr@@ atively . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a burned @-@ on bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing .
this must also be recognised if you are strictly against any kind of material damage .
here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; gets absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate importance , and the typical violence of the military police is covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on the confrontation course with the police . &quot;
the Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce of For@@ gotten Villa@@ ges in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba concluded the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the popular village Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - not@@ withstanding that there is no significant sugar harvest on site .
it is two years since the activities in sugar cane factories have been paraly@@ zed .
after exhaus@@ tion , the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ invent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and commu@@ te to the factories every day .
N@@ ene , a soldier &apos;s veter@@ an , who stands every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long period of in@@ active time , because they have been preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene recalls that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry with@@ stood the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the amount produced in 1910 .
the message would have been a concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are not news anymore .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry off ?
the old railway platform of the community saw even better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they became un@@ sustainable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories which could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis in the world market .
nevertheless , the price of sugar rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s will remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; Agricultural Pro@@ sp@@ ects &quot; issued by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate about 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
in the following years , the shut@@ down of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents said the same thing : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first year of the year , the first letters began to come .
it was official documents which differ@@ ed only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on the responsibility was over and the letters came more and more frequently .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane mills that were still in operation , &quot; he insur@@ es .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , is waiting for retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will in the de@@ commissioning of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with each part he removed , he dis@@ mounted one of his 31 years of work .
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and most important work@@ tops was wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives to the jobs and services generated in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know whether during the mamm@@ oth speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then President looked into the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well .

sugar cane has been extracted only high by milling since 2004 .

after two years Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to dis@@ regard it , they also stopped asp@@ hal@@ ting the road , which also dis@@ advant@@ aged other establishments .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they became spare parts .
without a perspective for the future , many young people also left the region .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production does not even serve for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma plant , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine yields to the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a supporting person , yet he does not give up the lies he told him .
they have tor@@ mented him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes to retirement at age 65 , not because he lacks strength , but because he is bit@@ tered .

first Nations people use hip @-@ hop to express themselves and preserve their own culture
capturing a song by &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
young people of the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do it using hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios to schools and youth centers in 2014 to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges who lives in Montreal and worked with ten cre@@ e communities in northern Que@@ bec and then collabor@@ ated with the Cre@@ e hip @-@ hop group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop thus increases that the young participants explore topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ eb First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered .
the cases were mostly not solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalization is .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youths do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation recorded , the refrain is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars hip @-@ hop @-@ group , who gave them a stop@@ per in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the verse is available , as is a translation into English , translated into German here :
sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day when you will take our cry
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise some@@ day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and go forward as well as our youth
this is how they can do what the Creator determined
in the comment section , the reader and advocate of Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the stop@@ list in sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( if necessary ) outside a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu are displayed near the entrance to sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( for example , &quot; plastic models of the dishes &quot; ) of any dish that is served in this restaurant .
customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they can enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the to@@ ki@@ oter neighbourhood of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so ordinary that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend is turning them into conspic@@ uous cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new mobile phone ribbon ador@@ n@@ ment decorated with plastic dishes , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tokyo department store .
many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collec@@ tives , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a couple of Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new boom in food inventory is becoming more and more complex . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this case , an emperor @-@ don ( a favorite rice bowl with seafood ) was turned into a cell phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular dish ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple pe@@ eling your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the com@@ ical .
some Handy @-@ stand and mobile @-@ designer allow you to create your own work of art . in this case , ik@@ ura or Lach@@ s@@ rogen is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my cell phone with salmon che@@ ated ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members .
our latest cell phone stand has the shape of mel@@ anch@@ oly ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon .
other quir@@ ky plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # smart@@ ly rate .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district C@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed regularly only appear in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the report on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a car@@ tel , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background .
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the mour@@ ners or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind every body , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; ap@@ pren@@ a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; dealing with drug trafficking &quot; ) that is intended to give these victims a voice and stories of people who were fighting between law enforcement agencies and car@@ tels .
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co describes the project as follows :
organised crime not only lets us fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and therefore have to drive entire communities for many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the P@@ ain of the Vic@@ tims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how afraid life changes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ up@@ e , a father looking for secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on one single day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday , we also prepare ourselves today for the task that we have set ourselves to go and search for graves after the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Guadal@@ up@@ e Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical shop in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back , but he never returned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is with me too .
at the moment she has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but she doesn &apos;t pay them because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; ap@@ poin@@ a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , fragi@@ lity and leadership .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of animal pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered as normal , no matter in what form it occurs :
I &apos;ve known disease and sensation@@ alism for some years now .
I come across newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with images that can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or of specialists from specialists .
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one being disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) if he is tall . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a stati@@ stic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of humanity is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rebel@@ li@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to say they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they don &apos;t touch and are silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the Capital District : how a family was sack@@ ed with threats . &quot; it describes how armed criminals were squee@@ zing money from their business month for month until they destroyed not only the business but also tore their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain of this never passes , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact you if it is absolutely necessary .
the farther we are from each other , the better .
she concluded her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when to kid@@ nap you or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days , whether cry would resolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a generation @-@ marked generation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organized crime ?
how is it possible to grow in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells us he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , cook potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make Chi@@ chi for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of age .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , the bloody cor@@ pse of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , as violence perpet@@ rated by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Council of Public Safety and the Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor had 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 per day .
these are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that survived the organized crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we must not forget .
in addition to the project &quot; ap@@ pren@@ a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 , whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking that has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ckr user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this article and the pages with which it links , contain images on which violence is represented .
the fact @-@ check is important at a moment when it comes to lifting a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether it is true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
let us take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its initial publication , it has been mis@@ leading to convert trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false link between picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample coverage of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 a tan@@ ker crossed the village of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pping around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war Africa &apos;s second largest country has been neglected for years and devast@@ ated . the roads in the region have become dangerous paths full of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tank truck fell victim to it .
government officials described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ oped dozens of houses , including a movie theater that was full of people who watched the World Cup .
houses burnt and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignorance .
a picture entitled &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ gu@@ r user My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident will depic@@ t the horrible scenes of this day .
above is an example .
there are rows of char@@ red bodies that are lined up on the ground while people watch them .
but here the story does not end .
over the years , the same photo has been suspended several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses dramatically reported atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one stayed behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a people to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images could the follow @-@ up time be illustrated .
the attack was also un@@ solved , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the image of the DR Congo re@@ appeared , when it was wrong@@ ly presented as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ appropri@@ ations ; Africa Check has been docum@@ enting assignments for Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely acc@@ ru@@ e the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments .
the image of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash of lightning , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee were beaten , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported about the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following , which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo , appeared :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news site , which in 2012 fal@@ sely claimed that the president of Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein was said to have participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image of the DR Congo to view this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations called AF@@ P as their source had also fal@@ sely attributed Th@@ ein existence to this statement , but had not brought the picture out of the DR Congo .
global reach of false data
traces of these false link@@ ages date back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information borders can cross . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the mentioned picture of the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ h of private sites , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have for@@ warded false reports , some others have attempted to expose fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have con@@ s@@ ented examples of mis@@ use and associated them with the respective countries on the basis of which page they have been published . thus , we want to portra@@ y the range more clearly than by the language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases are also linked ) , several examples may be used for impro@@ per use .
here are some cases which can now be fully detected ( on the map in orange ) :
map : news Fra@@ mes .
country examples of false copies of the picture from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries indicate pages or servers that are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications .
the gray countries are examples that , according to the metadata and information available through Tin@@ Eye , are likely to show counter@@ fei@@ ting examples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread on the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

one side that sheds light on rum@@ ours turned into question that the said photograph shows Christians who were killed by Muslims .
Canada , 2015 .
in this post , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City identifies not only the mis@@ information , but also discusses the mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria , as well as further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( in DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ Ã¡n qu@@ em@@ ando a los cr@@ isti@@ anos &quot; ( In Nigeria , they burn the Christians ) .
in this article on explo@@ sions in Nord @-@ Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ ca , the district is identified as the Christian section of the location .
La Rep@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ ca cited as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( where it is not known whether the original report has included the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
T@@ wit@@ ter@@ contributions after the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am like this one , who used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; have clearly not seen pages like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster who refu@@ te this .
Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the fla@@ wed use of the image since 2011 in association with Nigeria , at that time promoted by a post of US @-@ American , anti @-@ Islamic comment@@ ator Pam@@ ela G@@ eller .
Germany , 2017 . &quot; genocide against Muslims continues in Myanmar , Nobel Peace Prize lau@@ re@@ ate . &quot;

this statement was re@@ fut@@ ed by a Greek fact @-@ check @-@ side in 2013 and again in 2016 .
Iran , 2012 .
an association of the@@ ology students ( mul@@ la@@ hs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims about the N@@ asi@@ m news agency and to illustrate the image of DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .
an inhabit@@ ant of the P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o old town of Tren@@ to posted this news on his side to express his solidarity with the massac@@ res in Nigeria in 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from the DR Congo was shared as proof of the bom@@ b@@ ings of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in Kan@@ o in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example of an ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet that expresses sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand tries to deli@@ timi@@ ze the asser@@ tions that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being prosec@@ uted , since the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government published a report on what it meant to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intentionally dark news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ concep@@ tions about Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this ju@@ x@@ tap@@ osi@@ tion , which is exclusively published in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors that engage H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and are used by extrem@@ ist groups to reveal that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often dis@@ semin@@ ated by the Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
Russia , 2012 . &quot; c@@ low@@ ly @-@ over@@ s ? &quot; ( Christian@@ opho@@ bia or political provo@@ cation ? ) .
this post that addressed the members of the Russian Orthodox Church clearly shows that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news site fal@@ sely claimed that the president of Myanmar Th@@ ein died in 2012 that monks and politicians had participated in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still contained therein .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am published by the now deleted , Catholic close to the news page An@@ Ã¡@@ li@@ sis Digital , has explicitly stated that the picture is not of the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it represents a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture was later circul@@ ated in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ se@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ke@@ y@@ or@@ DÃ¼n@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world sleeps ) .
the image of the DR Congo , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , spark@@ ed a discussion among Muslims following the massac@@ res of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was taken as proof of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages that were connected were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media coverage in comparison with Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Chinese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was supposedly created by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be false .
the organization of the Clar@@ inet Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dis@@ soci@@ ated from the message in which the picture was contained in DR Congo .
there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) also points to Tin@@ Eye but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and tim@@ est@@ amps exist on the craw@@ ler and sometimes they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original item of 2010 , the picture may ultimately have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and Pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with Muslims or - to the defence of Muslims - the mur@@ ders of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming takes the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
with social media , there are tens of people who in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently share the water around a tragedy .
suggests this mood of mis@@ information and mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and ad@@ orn the real horror of what has actually happened in DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated extensively ( here for example ) .
one argument is that ref@@ using images of a refusal is equivalent to recognis@@ ing the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent ima@@ gery is des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ zing readers and viewers and taking them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investig@@ ates how violent media work to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media , the fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons is used according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. insur@@ moun@@ table ) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or at all difficult to translate .
there are such words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these inv@@ alu@@ able words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ k@@ ah ) .
but all stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist every attempt of a simple translation .
one word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird chose to focus on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from Van@@ u@@ atu &apos;s Mw@@ ot@@ cla@@ p language , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Custom@@ ize your parents in recognition of what has been done for you in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - the comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after getting war@@ med up in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds own words about :
they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish more of these &quot; inv@@ alu@@ able &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
speakers of the Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here .

how Sri Lanka deals with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide catastrophe this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally starts at the end of May , the rivers of Kal@@ u , Kel@@ eti , G@@ in , Nil@@ ov@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have stepped over the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
after an opinion of the disaster centre of Sri Lanka from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundred people are missing because of the floods and mud waves .
more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and around 100,000 people were transported to 304 safe places of residence .
rain falls on Saturday ( 27th May ) and the water levels in some areas slowly declined .
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the areas affected and still in@@ accessible .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly curse ag@@ grav@@ ates the Den@@ gue fever crisis , warns &quot; Save the Children , &quot; after further ra@@ inf@@ all are on the way .
morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle was also flooded due to the water level of Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and further five will be completed for the transport of emergency deliveries to the inhabitants enclosed in their flooded villages .
various organizations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ bat@@ ana .
please call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Cat@@ ast@@ op@@ al Center will be informed .
last year after the catastrophe of the tropical storm of Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ me introduced a &quot; flood control &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle for pick@@ up assistance and donations . they were then for@@ warded for free to the s@@ ri@@ lan@@ k@@ ische Red Cross .
they also launched a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button which resulted in more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue actions for people who were trapped by floods and land@@ slides .
the combined efforts of the government and the civil population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people into safety and provide relief measures .
this has prevented the loss of other lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore normal@@ cy .

the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January , I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and a dear friend .
I confi@@ de in her my four year old daughter , she confi@@ des in me her children ; she is my rock in the fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last minute we call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next one , we have rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with a head@@ sc@@ arf , bound by an American flag , some gu@@ essing slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hostili@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my friend looked at me saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already brought this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - of the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their imagination .
they de@@ vit@@ ate me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look alike .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , like me , do not fit into it , are dis@@ m@@ ated .
how to become Muslim
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this has happened to the poet whose poetry is most widely sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you think of when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ? peace ?
as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
the Qur &apos;an and the Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the Western imagination , the religion of Rum@@ i was er@@ ased , as well as from the most popular translations of its poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of the 1,7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist paintings of Muslims that have already colon@@ ized Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting ima@@ gery is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the landmark Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid dis@@ integrates history behind these images in the 1970s .
but these images continue to rise even today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to conf@@ use them .
I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , fla@@ wed nar@@ rati@@ ves dominate our news@@ feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that has led to nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the US won &apos;t even vote for its first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative fails to recognise that if French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings , and Saudi , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , both of which are two sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who perform movements for change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who were hi@@ jack@@ ed with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has stu@@ d@@ ded our collective imagination so deep and er@@ ron@@ eous that often S@@ ik@@ h @-@ men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories , which we tell and about the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia today is not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
among the 1,7 billion people
in the news industry we do more than just tell stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rati@@ ves that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to grasp the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims make up the highest degree &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ like Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims are among the first @-@ generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother put her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in New York &apos;s sky@@ scra@@ pers ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ lu@@ r Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan had re @-@ figured the world &apos;s sky@@ lines , my parents were ir@@ res@@ isti@@ ble Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a Muslim and an American ?
sometimes , when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of bringing out my Muslim recipes or my handy pocket basket , which all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ ok@@ er , we don &apos;t carry all the bags with us .
we also don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to almost always be chosen for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bic machine with credi@@ tors , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information that our already er@@ ron@@ eous picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , have manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a stranger who tears the veil on a woman .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was born only then in my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life they refer back to the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , if I held her in my arms and whis@@ per her the Arabic verses to the protection that seal the Koran and call the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim membership is always part of my shadow .

belonging to my grandmother &apos;s mother &apos;s side with her sisters ; how to win a contest of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi decades ago .
it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and incomplete paintings of painted Su@@ fi saints ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which it can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
being Muslim means speaking the prayers that she told me when I have a bad day .
to be Muslim is how she taught me to refer to God : God Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people that - over centuries - was col@@ oni@@ alized by an &quot; Empire &quot; which established a company with the name of Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a profound meaning to call God my only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grandfather .

belonging means growing up and hearing that men do not we@@ ep , but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant grandfather is crying .
in the meantime , while he writes books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an ev@@ aded ir@@ as@@ ingly to his family in India ruled K@@ ash@@ mir , family , which he could not close to his arms in half a century .
affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , like my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as at stake .
to be Muslim means knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans have all been &quot; col@@ oni@@ alized &quot; to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dropped over a century over a Muslim country .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , K@@ ash@@ mir al @-@ tan of the British Empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mosque in England .
before there were planes , he traveled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to be part of my Muslim tribe of 1,7 billion goes deep into our memorable family trees , our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops scattered over every continent except Antar@@ cti@@ ca , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy tre@@ mb@@ les the US and the susp@@ ects bear a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago , the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liberated black slave named Bil@@ al .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African schol@@ ar called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black life count .
to be an American , a Pakistan woman , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple d@@ ashes , but to fail to communicate with others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of the 1,7 billion carries more possibilities than a magic cube but is represented in the reducing branch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people are building structural Islam hostili@@ ty .
structural Islam hostili@@ ty exists in the Muslim registr@@ ations that began with President Bush and wi@@ dened under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a country that closes its borders towards people from just the countries it bom@@ bed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is largely aimed at Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars that we are leading and the bombs that we drop to Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from Nor@@ th@@ western University showed participants a science @-@ based image and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversation we have to lead
we are too deeply dar@@ ed to abst@@ ain from the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
we are back decades back to recognise the roots of our fears and the fla@@ wed and dangerous pic@@ torial im@@ prints we get in our news editorial offices .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our often frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ awi ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square over black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sh@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .

but I am concerned about this difficult global point of time in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now run the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years before , they had not yet given them ; now they control large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the story that I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who today have turned me into a dis@@ connected Muslim .
things that I left here like a bread cro@@ aking lane in my speech .
things that may aw@@ aken memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that constitutes our humanity , a story may lie where someone is being made to another .
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations take place within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .
poster of the Facebook page of the Islam@@ opho@@ bia Security Network .
we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why am I telling this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are w@@ aged and people are be@@ amed through the work of the &quot; other &quot; in the public imagination , four decades ago even scientist of Stan@@ ford was .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of consciously and un@@ consciously doing the &quot; other &quot; ; just as my girlfriend and I committed in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president to feed chocolate cake while he already bom@@ bed countries and &quot; other made &quot; people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban speech diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ckr user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer .
recently , Global Vo@@ ices reported a new initiative by Steven Bird , an insur@@ moun@@ table blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the variety of languages of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there .
for the makers of the project , the following applies :
the mass mortality of the world languages can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - secure spaces in which inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen often to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to feel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers introduce their history first in their own language and then translate them in English .
even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their devotion and depic@@ tion lead to the presence of the audience .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of Daf@@ ing . during this turn , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of the narrative art that are typical for her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the tale of the rab@@ bits and the bab@@ oon in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the meaning of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ am@@ us ara is asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a wide gr@@ in , he shares his feeling of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot; &quot; &quot;
they listened to you !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story @-@ telling performances .
Puerto Rico claims from the US New Det@@ er@@ mination of Public Deb@@ t
with the goal of re@@ viewing the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , several religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 ; the march started at the pu@@ er@@ tori@@ an Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old@@ town of San Ju@@ an .
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ vic Front for the Ne@@ ural Audi@@ ting of Deb@@ t ) and the E@@ kom@@ en@@ ic church assembly Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of the re @-@ determination of debts also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people Puerto Rico claims that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts are responsible for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a management committee with no personal interests in the public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding compensation , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people Puerto Rico refuses to pay a debt which is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves with falling pension payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - is suffering from a serious financial crisis .
hence the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organisation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on national responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
from the outside imposed measures will run without the participation and conviction of citizens in danger of being rejected by the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration carried the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night guard for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue to campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he has provided for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Publi@@ ca , the annual conference on the digital culture that is hosted in Berlin , an event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign was dedicated .

the book , which was published last year and is available here license @-@ free , contains a number of articles dealing with the free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it says :
this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up and what the true costs are with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was deleted from the A@@ dra Pris@@ on &apos;s directory in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that push@@ es for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom , right away .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has allowed many of us to start thinking about their own f@@ ates , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown location from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; military police &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had taken the basis of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; top secret &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by persons who presented themselves as an inside of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
however , his place of residence and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , technologi@@ sts and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded the Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ tian cultural prototypes was more pro@@ vision@@ ally than the work he started with a group of arch@@ e@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ lis@@ ations , and here Greek @-@ Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
Bass@@ el could not yet know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put everything on it , to wipe out this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ria but the world .
this expedition into the digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my whole life dreaming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was already in custody .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ sab@@ bath that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for a year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is available free of charge .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; It happens &quot; :
it happens at every visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose sight in the moment in which we embrace ,
that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and watch@@ men
I forget the crow@@ ding of the prison
and I enter into every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion with me ,
if your eyes say farewell
and I let another piece of my soul leave with you ...
I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all the moments ,
and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence .
I convince myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the detention of Bass@@ el G@@ haz@@ i wrote :
a year passes , my soul
while at the same time
I am in your cage ,
and you &apos;re still in the monster cage
Bas@@ tian history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against regime Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights .
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime were tortured or even executed .
until 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in prison since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today , we reiter@@ ate our claim in the hope that we must do this for the last time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mozambique : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to corruption condemned director after release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back to previous post &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mozambique re@@ acted to a corruption case in which a member of the government returned after half his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus where corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other defend@@ ants due to em@@ be@@ zz@@ lement of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800 000 Euro ) .
the money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique , whose advice was made by Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good leadership and immediately called for his return to the company , which happened on 19 April .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which submitted the motion , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old post , as the company did not complete any disciplinary proceedings following his imprisonment .
however , many inhabitants do not mean the action well .
the Centre for Public Integ@@ rity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ ca , C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , in an interview with Deutsche Welle condemned the company &apos;s decision to put the director again :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should have initiated a disciplinary procedure against the infrin@@ gement .
the company apparently was silent and did not take reasonable legal steps to apply the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contradictory &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za were a competent guy , he would be a consultant , after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had been cut off .
he could give lectures and motiv@@ ational speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has con@@ s@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za will gladly pay for his silence .
disgu@@ sting !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says that the director does not have any mor@@ als :
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him . I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lack moral return and serving the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead has only served by the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as if it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ut prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remember that a th@@ ief is in prison :
they belong to Sam@@ ora mach@@ el prison and will not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , one @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic speakers .
one of his most famous oral presentations was when he strongly affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of all , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that he is not . he changes tactics , but he doesn &apos;t turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is criminal at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison ; he sat down for 10 years and was released .
and today the company , in which he de@@ comp@@ etes money , sets him under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Clear@@ s Jas@@ min ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) May 12 , 2017

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored a lot of users wrong@@ ly
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ a or split@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network picked up their posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East India , or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or , as part of an initiative , to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma on the social network .
in recent years , the as@@ cen@@ sion of radical nation@@ alist movements gave the word an extremely ab@@ ject con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as a hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may be associated with racism today , but the word itself does not automatically evo@@ ke hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt for the purpose of its use have been cens@@ ored .
furthermore , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with different mean@@ ings , which have the same sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , throne is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( split@@ ting ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ei@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ b@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; such :
a post of one of my friends was extingu@@ ished today because it contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to relieve his back pain by doing a pu@@ n .
the proposition ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Burma - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is of the opinion that it will reduce the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analy@@ tic before it extingu@@ ishes all posts that are suspected of spreading racism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Facebook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the next words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( split@@ ting b@@ sen ) .
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who are spreading hate speech have a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to cut off their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all who dis@@ semin@@ ate hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a scratch and mouse game , whereby users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternate sp@@ elling of cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at describes how Facebook began to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
... as I became aware of this new policy of Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting , posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post &quot; did not meet the Facebook Community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intent or simply try to show their opinions against the hate speeches of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
mail without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese internet community asking for advice :
Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to l@@ essen racism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring even more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also seems that they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned such words as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to rec@@ tify the fal@@ si@@ fied hosts .
if they only had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that gave them a big turnover , that would be great .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ orship &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has provided users with a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of taking it seriously , users are now making fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken away from the network .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that didn &apos;t contain a hate speech , but were removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese lyrics are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot used with permission .
the post states , &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot;
screen@@ shot used with permission .
in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally heat the violence in Myanmar &apos;s communities , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to bring the balancing hate speeches on its Bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but instead of just cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; it would have been better to look closer to context than on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago concludes with the to@@ e
a wedding ring in the sand .

the to@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted unanim@@ ously a law which should forbi@@ d this practice , so that the age @-@ capable age is now at 18 .
in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organisation ( I@@ RO ) , a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere , as it is not the age that govern@@ s maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contracting partner of the UN &apos;s Convention on Human Rights , the min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defined &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the age of 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UN statistics for 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children already married in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical central office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys under 19 were married in 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements focused on creating laws on child@@ birth followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result .
however , not everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the child , they should , condem@@ ning themselves to their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sort of religious opposition led to tensions in this virtually un@@ complicated affair , and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the child marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent that contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law be announced .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which re@@ posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the child marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and not a single one against it .
after having previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were enthusiastic because the laws on child marriage had finally been changed .
Facebook member Lo@@ vel@@ l Francis , who held a minist@@ erial ministry in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk that obsc@@ ures the core of the thing , but do you know what ? the to@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth every price .
while Abel Jackson thought it took a long time to aboli@@ sh the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : news !
the Act has been approved .
minimum age - 18 , - 35 - 0 on the other hand ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ey Mut@@ ota , a member of the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group who spoke openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the marriage @-@ capable age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the amend@@ ment to the amend@@ ment of the Act was approved today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present in the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all de@@ pu@@ ties agreed to have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the to@@ e is legally no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ care label abuse .
many thanks to all the activists who fought for him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our MEPs .
but a possible catch comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of San@@ atan , Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most well @-@ known Hind@@ u organization in the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj had announced his intention to take legal steps , should the law be passed , and he seems to have made his promise now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wished that the debate on the subject would be different .
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l proposed :
dear SAT , instead of keeping the discussion so general in a way that can only evo@@ ke panic and dis@@ grace , if we , instead of speaking of the problem that we , to protect our daughters from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are in favor of them , &quot; would you then be prepared to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the child &apos;s marriage in different gra@@ dations is legal or still the norm , although there are laws that prohi@@ bit them .

for over a month now Turkey has been blocking the popular Encyclopedia of Wikipedia , based on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle .
day after day , it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series oppose the block@@ ade .
although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to use b@@ ypass tools for blocked web pages ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN @-@ pre@@ valence of the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008 , as has recently been described in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University has been taking place regular block@@ ings since 2007 , after the internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , several M@@ irr@@ oring Pages ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) are now sur@@ faced .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform ex@@ poses all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is , however , irre@@ vo@@ cable in spite of legal prohibition .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about its efforts :
after listening to the news ( about the locking of Wikipedia ) , we put all the sn@@ ap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the content in a decentr@@ alized and distributed way .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia articles , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also stated that this step was carried out independently from the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the barrier .

a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for natural protection

used with permission .
S@@ ag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ red with poorly positioned motifs and washed colors .
this motiv@@ ates him to carry a camera himself and try to straigh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , S@@ ag@@ ar tries to bring N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s wildlife to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park offers him the perfect opportunity to take photos that draw attention to N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this prime location helps him in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just stopped at home when I suddenly called to Navar@@ re ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida ) . he had received a call from my father that a leop@@ ard would be on the banks of the Rap@@ ti River .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the leop@@ ard was located and I immediately began to kne@@ ad pictures ! !
S@@ ag@@ ar stri@@ ves to co @-@ operate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look like .
and he was to know it , for he stood up against tig@@ ers face to face , saying ,
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .

to promote the protection of wild animals , S@@ ag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on its photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and usually lived in a tent in order to take pictures of Ot@@ tern in Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photograph of birds living near the tourist accommodation .

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version was once again published as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , it is possible to avoid women with the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h women admit that because of the social pressure they should respect the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , get this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto from the Indian State O@@ dish@@ a was convic@@ ted by a fake court and rejected by her family and the village community after addressing a married family with names .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives also not by name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer re@@ mitt@@ ances to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main topic of the city quickly .
it is a place only for them alone , in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , it is part of # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al &apos;s campaign , which is operated by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and advoc@@ ates for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ist has been working with the help of her video camera for seven years on the discovery of practices such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of HIV and AIDS infected individuals , and leads these clubs .
it tells of how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion was of women who do not call their hus@@ bands name .
she decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify .
not to speak out loud on the names of their hus@@ bands , is a custom that they are fully responsible and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition att@@ ests that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is considered as dec@@ eit@@ ful , a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deep @-@ rooted that we never thought about this round of discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband at her name , wanted to try at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him now by his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this confidence in luggage , Roh@@ ini started its first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion going .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to tell her husband &apos;s name with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , aff@@ ection@@ ate and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to bring their hus@@ bands name over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a century @-@ old tradition in which married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so shy that she only kne@@ aded in front of her during the whole exercise ; another decided to release the whole stra@@ ined fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on her faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in an adren@@ alin rush about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands at home .
and they kept their word .
in the coming days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put the women up@@ side down : his wife could not stop telling his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law was star@@ ing her , she got scared and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini thought I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman &apos;s husband was less understanding and the situation was in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the cin@@ ogenic red dot on the forehead that shows the mar@@ ital status :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
I told my husband that I would wear the zin@@ ok @-@ red dot if he did it too .
he laugh@@ ed only , and I stopped wearing it .
the other women have not stopped completely , but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it in some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion at every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what they hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months , for the first time in their lives , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things al@@ oud , no matter how small they are .
in a discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is associated with the clothes .
some women in the group have only carried sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most people this is okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ ad @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pair of trousers , they didn &apos;t dare .
after a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own clothing choice , the mor@@ als associated with the Sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled her own pair of Cur@@ tas ( shirts ) into a discussion round so that the women could wear it .
next , they decided to take a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will do it .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly :
so far we have only made small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then they stopped saying the name of her husband .
some , including myself , are still doing it , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now carry Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hag@@ gling around more freedom of movement or the choice of clothing - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we are all in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a Day of Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce
Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot from the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on June 29th of this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in 1964 in London , noted in 2016 on the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just about five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
people here quickly became aware that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ kei Asian Review .
good morning ! today the Beat@@ les Memorial Day is in Japan .
even today songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese secondary schools .
the Beat@@ les kit@@ sch survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is supposed to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it belongs to fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the known places connected with the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you absolutely have to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Matthew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( New York Memorial )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be com@@ ical enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
exactly today in 1966 the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and walked over Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
and of course some companies also use the fan base in terms of market @-@ technology , such as this R@@ amen @-@ Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen !
and what could that be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is how the day is going to run today .
so , we hope that you are there !

bald men are kidn@@ apped and killed in Mozambique
Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia &apos;s police warned the population that bald men could be targets of attacks in Mozambique .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of individuals for organ trafficking , probably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , concerns the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans were used in Tanzania and Malawi .
there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man can contain gold or bring wealth , the police spokesman of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia of the BBC explained .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
another group , which is the target of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to a mission conducted in South Africa in 2016 in order to examine this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique are targets of ritual attacks , the Mozambique police warned about the latest kill@@ ings of three men of men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police were already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of members of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , for presumably super@@ sti@@ tious rituals , has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a faith exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power , generating wealth .
in the last days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
on Facebook , Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of B@@ log@@ gers poor S@@ nai@@ ppa , indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique :
I M@@ Ã@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE ER@@ IN Mos@@ ambique , THE S@@ ICH IS ashamed A country where the teachers would be ashamed to offer sex against good marks , work and other services , a nation in which people would not hurt honest pursu@@ its , or even take their lives to make their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald men would be hun@@ ted for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes or &quot; black magic , &quot; which aim to achieve rapid wealth .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ ren humor .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter benef@@ actor , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange and the police spokesperson Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald men :
the Moz@@ am@@ anian authorities are very concerned about the assass@@ ination of bald men .

they reported that their husband had been sentenced to death , but gave no further information .
Bas@@ tian &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials discovered that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we show the honour of Bass@@ el as a pioneer of open @-@ web movement .

free Bass@@ el : citizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ates and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years &quot; imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state endanger@@ ing ) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o claiming the democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a nar@@ rator says that he deemed it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not required to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , China continues to receive calls from the international community , Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to allow him to do a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out .
Hong Kong Free Press summari@@ zed a number of reactions from abroad .
United Nations , United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
a spokesman , however , refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad .
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to a stand@@ still after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government shared that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to re @-@ record the salmon trip to China , since exports have largely been blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed hope for an unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the leaders of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also urged China to release Li@@ u , as she shared in an Declaration on June 30 :
at the same time , we expect China to lift all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ u &apos;s wife and family members .
they should meet and receive all visits that they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA - USA
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told the Americans that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want him to have the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as it assi@@ sts him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced on 27 June the AF@@ P news agency that the message would appeal to the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US Embassy &apos;s request attracted a fur@@ ious response from China , with the Foreign Ministry &apos;s statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley told China that China should offer the following :
protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , which they claim according to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the US sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to un@@ condition@@ ally release Li@@ u and his wife .

Germany , Germany
German spokesman Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u will receive all the medical support he needs and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping was on July 7 and 8 at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing of the Reu@@ ters news agency that China had great concerns about whether the fuss surrounding Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada - Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um requested China to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ us attorney told AF@@ P earlier that Li@@ u &apos;s wife Li@@ u X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak and contact anyone outside , including his lawyers .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and release the rights reserved for the exercise of these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
France , France
in an Declaration on 29 June , France &apos;s Foreign Office urged China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where he is . furthermore , his wife and family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information out whether France will finally accept it .
Taiwan Republic of Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of continental affairs in Taiwan urged China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and show a greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means in order to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator , Yu @-@ Me@@ i @-@ nu , of the governing Democratic Progressive Party also urged China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned about Li@@ u on 28 June and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he was severely punished , led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt personally very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 that stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city .
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the Minister observed that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he supported Singapore to be considered a city .
... nobody asked if New York was a democracy ...
that &apos;s it , most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turn logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian regime of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we can say that we are ultimately not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very clas@@ sy : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; in the face of that , it seemed inv@@ ari@@ ably un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he def@@ ends the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally towns that are permanently guided by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ re comes up from author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twisted logic , since it fits better to their power .
in the end the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam was given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system really non @-@ answers .
he disgu@@ ised appropriate questions with non @-@ answers of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng asks Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion , as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it difficult to swallow .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point , provided that it was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by publishing his comment on the blog , he points out concerning the critics that one should start reading the entire address of the conference , so that the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam could be better understood , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the notes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
when he said that Singapore was not a country , it obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense !
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who , as the leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it is properly associated and aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ covers the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; has Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; committed a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian spokesman ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , which country will the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the government cabinet , Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements are of great importance .
why do the people of Singapore have their military service , do they defend only their city but not their country ?
who must pay back our Prime Minister &apos;s bills ?
what is the value of our pink ID card ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade is ten@@ ding to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore and has always been a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proposition seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island nation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defence of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadi@@ ans &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
recently , Global Vo@@ ices asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with rum@@ ours about certain parts of the world exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question posed to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered poli@@ te to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice Ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Canadi@@ ans probably cook with anger when they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t mind that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that differenti@@ ates us Canadi@@ ans of Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans can make a Canadian flag clearly visible on their ru@@ cksack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free healthcare !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are poli@@ te .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously often say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first of all , I have many American friends whom I admire very much .
I wouldn &apos;t be able to conf@@ use myself with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
mit Adam aus San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , being called a &quot; nice &quot; means to be sk@@ e@@ worthy - like the ben@@ evol@@ ent , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has his own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger ) .
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harmless is to be in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not paying attention .
this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far from things that happen around you .
I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major property of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps simply a cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence across the fence .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau came on stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ ano@@ ene Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a pop band , famous in Thailand , published a music video that par@@ o@@ gues the jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and , in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government , continued to go@@ vern the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells about the rules he makes his girlfriend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although not specifically politically , the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for the song was a huge success .
within the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook was divided 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists invited the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at those videos that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly pursued over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional Constitution , which gives absolute discretion to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief on important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change of settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people viewed by the jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other revi@@ e@@ wers of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army that monitors online content and prosec@@ uted people who are accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thailand is committed to a strict commitment to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( majority offen@@ se ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was declared in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at .
one of the problems the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an intern@@ ment store , another problem .
some journalists are in jail , because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long sentences when they insul@@ t the monarchy .
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Hunger Games , &quot; which was already used by coup opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life goes on in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ ch@@ asia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here courtesy .
the post @-@ war society recovered only very slowly in East Ab@@ ch@@ asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now passed over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ hic war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still very visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ carbon pool of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups , including Russians , Greeks , Asia , Geor@@ gian and Armen@@ ians , lived and worked in Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most of the Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ asen live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people living in these gh@@ ost@@ ly cities .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , having barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s called Chr@@ u@@ zh@@ ko@@ vo are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings have fallen into decay and are rarely inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha village I met a native elderly man .
he begins a conversation and it is difficult for him to finish this .
&quot; all this is a result of the war . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do I speak ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless it is unique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all of which served the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magnific@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
about fifty inhabitants live in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
approximately 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ z kas , which still harbour one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in their hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to let us take pictures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it just banned us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) , such as livestock breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman with the name Gal@@ ina ( or A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) moved from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her el@@ dest daughter who lives in France Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will stay forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to accept financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sts she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ ina &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t have a vegetable garden or a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells them that they and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this all the time - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; they said we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini .
I have already prepared the floor .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s inter@@ loc@@ utor , Nat@@ ascha , lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for a while .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day , it reminds itself of the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ ch@@ asia collap@@ sed simply ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; we recently bought land in Suk@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital of Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but that will take some time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha will receive approximately $ 9 children &apos;s money for each child .
her husband works in the mine pit .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house , where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
she tells us that at first it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time , she lost her anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war , there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right for them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day how the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation turns to the end , a little boy is running past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy is ch@@ asing after him .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
as they run , some of them throw stones on the ruined buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which care for their lives .
they don &apos;t know each other differently .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez heads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here courtesy .
on the way of migrants attempting to cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink bri@@ ll@@ ine structure and gold @-@ coloured earrings in ted@@ dy bears .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . yet they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians , who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2.@@ 50 dollars a night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom , there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants are coming here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells , come the people in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
at present it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already welcomed 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already been sleeping outside on car@@ tons .
it does not want to reject anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are ill , she bu@@ ys them drugs that they cannot pay , she mass@@ aging them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived a short time ago .
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a sta@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao is travelling with his sister hoping to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children there .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is normal for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north .
the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel together and that Afri@@ cans are already talking about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker for the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he started his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months . he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will be in contact with Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mother Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her guests often send her text messages when they went to sal@@ ute her or to tell her about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the driving force of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have received migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
he began to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on blankets on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his workplace .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children , who wanted to squee@@ ze money out of him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown person , a single person , offered it to him .
a few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go the next step .
back in the house of Mama Africa , everything is again full of guests .
in the ais@@ les , the travel@@ er calm@@ ly consult their phones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most of them from Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ ma she smoo@@ ths her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair care , which she has made a lady , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she introduces her to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;ve been gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
a check point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users , in the first quarter of 1996
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones .
on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of the city Ur@@ um@@ qi received a cell phone notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaner &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the authorities have also been using the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because , shortly after they had installed the app , they exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
in the police announcement that the app would locate and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
this app for min@@ ors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these features can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or steal from it .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while reports of digital cens@@ orship in China focus mostly on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the East and South , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the areas of conflict , the authorities often submit far @-@ reaching cens@@ ors and surveillance measures , as well as rout@@ inely Internet shut@@ downs .
the Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China , &quot; which publishes cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where police checked the inhabitants indi@@ scri@@ min@@ ately if they had installed the monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure that people use the official j@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification requested that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are discovered at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they might be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use equipment that is intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity through the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from mainland China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( for the first time in the first quarter ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift up the password request of a Windows operating system , thereby ensuring unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang &apos;s installation , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council to minimize dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
all branches of government , government and related institutions , including universities and research institutes , are obliged to follow the instructions of the cy@@ ber security office in the operation of their computers and communication devices .
Freedom House &apos;s current report , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of Ur@@ um@@ qi regional capital to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police station on June 27 .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; this action however viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and awards them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , Part 1 : everything cries after death

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and find that you are alone in a place where everything important is missing .
everything has gradually been resolved and revealed a truth that is clearly visible both from the inside and from the outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one that makes their name all honor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one that has put down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but when the reality re@@ covers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters are transformed into beings from flesh and blood , and everything cries out after death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even if the Earth continues on the axis of evil . it becomes clear to you that you are trapped here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone .
they arrested me and my father three times , but this was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the Security Service put it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were ri@@ pped out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all quarters of the city sought , only my own .
for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that is stuffed into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the electricity supply stopped functioning in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice resist@@ ing through the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we turned to a magnificent picture that filled my expectations completely .
in such a moment you are aware that you release the mind from the lamp , but it just doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he stopped .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you have scre@@ amed the whole way up to the office of security service out of the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear you scre@@ aming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are brave enough to sh@@ out if we are not close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you are gri@@ eving for what to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was standing in front of this building .
perhaps it was about my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps at the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my cause when I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t think you &apos;ve forgotten my voice again since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think I have never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret the word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in solitary confin@@ ement and his father with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is right with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this accur@@ sed movement lies in my nose today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture I was subjected to for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with myself .
then back through the yard and into the second office that leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I would like to introduce all the details before I enter the room .
unlike otherwise , they have allocated me a larger cell this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with only one other prisoner , and I must immediately set myself without waiting for permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old @-@ tried communication method : to strike with the fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first resp@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
apparently , in none of the surrounding cells there was a rep@@ utable middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and is called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness there are no signs of facial features , and there are no doctors here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all answers den@@ ote his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to chase away all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ oured in the fruits in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I still hear them scre@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be approximately 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ ams sound , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black was the color of corruption , until I saw the yellow light that presented to us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; allu@@ ding to the 13th S@@ ure of the Quran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be interro@@ gated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was revealed : to protect the state security against us and prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itors and terrorists in us , they speak in the Ala@@ wit@@ e dialect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ list and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their world view .
this is not a house that is not a country ; it is a curse which they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero .
I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me that way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he begins a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , in spite of the expressions that resemble him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start as much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon end up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it , not to reply .
I can &apos;t say more exactly when insul@@ ts and strikes have become an everyday means of communication for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , even though I had done nothing to earn this penalty .
punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ate confession .
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your exec@@ ution@@ er will delight in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him and you can &apos;t with@@ hold your cries .
my scre@@ ams weren &apos;t enough for him , so they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
during my first arrest , I asked myself if the investig@@ ator had worked as a waste collector in the past or whether that belonged to the normal work equipment .
they inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to present us the great discovery of a huge cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them altern@@ ated while I was still in line .
I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I ceased to scre@@ am .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and did not take any pleasure in it , which is why he interven@@ ed next to an electrically charged stick .
power f@@ lowed my whole body , enough to supply all my neighborhood .
my half naked body lying on the ground was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours left , which came to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be silent and keep you , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always left me free .
where do they lead me ? !
Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and opposition
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he sl@@ um@@ bs to his screen , sometimes to his computer , and back to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips stained with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives in the top@@ most story of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s family to escape from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( such as Far@@ mer ) .
for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who confron@@ ts the conservative majority and questioned their ancient opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ music .
with his music , which often deals with issues such as ori@@ ental alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also calls out the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities ranging from Damascus to Syria through to San@@ aa in Yemen .
at the age of 25 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his mind , and he can feel according to his own statement with the people suffering from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not openly admit it , he has a special reluct@@ ance against U.S. foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation &quot; - he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and never before in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a person , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he sha@@ kes Nes@@ cafÃ© in water in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness in breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a scor@@ ching hot jun@@ ta has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the li@@ gn@@ um lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the squ@@ ad@@ ron of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially if you look at the neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan , to drink water - in order not to land in prison .
recently the Interior Ministry of Jordan said a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that sexual orientation of the homos@@ exual fron@@ ts@@ singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the country &apos;s cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert cancellation .
the MP and former press secretary of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ ner@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was &quot; just &quot; cancelled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation .
many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which questioned the established legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la appreciated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to advocate for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement might not be simply shallow rhet@@ oric , but in fact reflect an increasingly clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b reg@@ ressed traditional gender men by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a clearly laid @-@ down woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they really should trust .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , the number of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honour kill@@ ings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honour kill@@ ings reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is further ag@@ grav@@ ated that Jordan lacks institutional infrastructure to support the women who attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
according to a 1954 law on crime against crime , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; be held in@@ definitely in prison &quot; and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expendi@@ tures as well as the guarantee from the family that the woman will not happen .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues that have long been considered tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; politics has been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fed in &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b is attacking the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs , which are political at the core , can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song one verse often repe@@ ats :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you , in his words , &quot; can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bian and that comments on the equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals were strongly cens@@ ored by 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to find out later that his comments were torn apart , twisted and in his opinion cens@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , stre@@ amed but only a edited version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is campaig@@ ning openly for the Arabic LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not talk about Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ eva , a poet of the eighth century , who is still remembered today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ i , who was supposed to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph later , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom it is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service established several former members of the government and members of the teacher association , with the reasoning that they have critically commented on comments in social media that are related to corruption @-@ rooted corruption .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion is just the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now resist@@ ed M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that &apos;s how H@@ da@@ i@@ b - is made up of slow , thou@@ ghtful and inner changes . he is sure that these changes take place every day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without interventions abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experiencing it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will be approached by music , art and literature on a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , cluster mun@@ itions and arti@@ fici@@ ally induced demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes this .
until the time comes , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will move on and also resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or dolls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festivals .
it is assumed that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually celebrated in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us in August . another theory states that the ar@@ mor@@ ed cars , the drums and dancing were handed down over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies from west Japan mar@@ ched into the north @-@ east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
it is hard to imagine how large these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I have been looking forward to the meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two anch@@ or@@ ages are just to be seen .
however , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend your summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of an 18 @-@ meter @-@ high carriage was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans swap weapons against sh@@ ears and raz@@ ors

rarely external appearances and body care were as important as in this story , because they help keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crimin@@ ality and promote a legitimate profession like the one of the bar@@ ber .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the Pacific Ocean , close to Lima &apos;s historic center - a region with a very high crime rate where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug trafficking are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to the fact that more and more regular citizens go into the seas@@ oned hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these expensive hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair styles that go to the most extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the bar@@ ber &apos;s &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &quot; competition , which has been taking place since 2014 .
there experts are competing against each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks as you can see in the next video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as Augu@@ sto Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy who are located in El Cal@@ la@@ o found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dres@@ sers and to receive training in hair@@ dres@@ sers instead of bad advice , which enables them to find work .
motivated by this activity and offering opportunities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently fashionable .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only specialist school in the community and the district where we are very proud , because we have built this educational community out of love for the children .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ er@@ illa fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with kind permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love messages to gu@@ er@@ illa fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we just write love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel expelled ?
this is exactly what prompted the young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired her to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la ( Let@@ ters for Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters .
only recently their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government closed a peace treaty with the gu@@ erri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , forming the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signing of the peace treaty was considered to be so significant that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
but before Colom@@ bians there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years and have been exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carried their arms around the clock must now re @-@ integrate into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred against gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , must now take in its ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians would have to join together and help in the process of integration .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : up to now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ er@@ illa fighters to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ er@@ illa fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to talk briefly to K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine &apos;s Day but forget those who need them much more need@@ less .
he was planning to share his love with people that needed the most urgent appeal this year .
so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former F@@ ARC fighters who now need to find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; she says .
so far more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ i never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were delivered on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo of the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp to personally pass the letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC have set themselves up as they had done before to accept the commands of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of protection from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; explained the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience as follows :
after passing the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of the gu@@ er@@ illa fighters .
when I looked into one of the &quot; Cam@@ bus@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut where the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters were living ) I saw a gu@@ er@@ illa fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ gar@@ net , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I still spoke to him and asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never before in my life someone wrote me something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the tears run over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him very tightly and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was tired of the war , was sorry to be the faithful companion of this struggle all the years , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life as a war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms .
until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
at the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together for a discussion .
the students were all grown up when there was war and the F@@ ARC had already acted in secret .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC have declared the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process . &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the State affects the whole Colom@@ bian people . now that we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help shape society more just in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a purpose of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
hearing these people who had never heard of hearing and had no right to vote , and realizing that people , whom I often saw and hated as a monster , were also only people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and so much damage done , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the camp commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­@@ o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
Colom@@ bians were prophes@@ ied that peace would reign after dis@@ armament .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is inequality , famine and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to take arms , rise and protest for their rights . and that is fully justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and sacrifice , for we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence , will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

this is the translation of an article that was written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ h@@ owa and its first publication on the website OC Media .
homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region face a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with terror activists have witnessed the coverage of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that hangs over the LG@@ BT@@ Q community on the LG@@ BT@@ Q community did not come into being only overnight .
OC media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured the international head@@ lines several months ago after reports have been published that address the spread , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ ash@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested her susp@@ icious qu@@ eer men and put her in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood she felt she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , and why she moved to Moscow .
after having experienced a group of Tsch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen from the sex balance of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
for fear of her life , she finally moved to the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer for a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
as I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread her everywhere on the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can remove that shame ? &quot;
after that the photos of my documents made the rounds through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
when I was there to fetch a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long do you want to honor the family , you stain ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I just know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up at the hospital in the end .
apparently some women had got everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which wings were you placed - in the men or women of the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very grateful to him for that .
when I read his name for the first time in his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for having dealt with me with respect .
I spent more than a month at the hospital .
last February , I received threats .
they called me , wrote to me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they asked me , I must prove it by going through the streets above ; others wanted me to appear on official TV in Gros@@ ny saying that I didn &apos;t change my gender , that everything was just bad , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You brought a monster to the world that sh@@ ook not only your family , but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too much for my mother and she laid a rope around her neck .
fortunately the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time , I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later a car with a dark window pan@@ es and a license plate with a 95 on it stood under the window .
after it had happened for the third time , it became clear to me that something was wrong .
my human rights activists checked out the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you escape ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I still can &apos;t understand how it could be .
just before I left Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
I bought it without regi@@ stering , without identification , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moment I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I received a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you &apos;re safe , just because you left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
our people already know in which hotel you are . they even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to prove it to you : it &apos;s the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine it ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still get in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about the gender balance , this is a tab@@ oo subject .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this psychological barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I really try to look at the person she recalls from her past - so to my male form .
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who are dor@@ man@@ t ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for him , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who has been in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he said that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tortured , but also that everyone could hardly wait for the end of Ram@@ adan , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these care about the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experienced by blood grati@@ fication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC media : are gay men still being held in these secret pris@@ ons ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says that there are not so many people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if , then , especially those who have no rich relations or who have been dropped by their relatives to face Kad@@ y@@ rows &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can present them later as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and say they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , they were deliberately immersed in order to become radi@@ cal@@ ised .
OC media : is that just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown beard .
there was nothing new from them ever since .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken .
until now they have not been presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports so far . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why else wouldn &apos;t we have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already occurred in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think before 2003 I was already known all over Gro@@ z@@ ny when I lived there - and I never had any problems .
seriously !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was applied , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now .
in the end , Russia wanted to bring us back to the &quot; civili@@ zation , &quot; but in the end it has thrown us back into the Stone Age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were sli@@ pped ; I had tin@@ ted eyel@@ ashes , wore tube jeans and short tops .
the Ministry of security of Sh@@ aria never even hurt me a hair .
before the Russian Theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several benches stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never offen@@ ded .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a phrase : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to be children when they laugh at the sick .
OC media : so they just closed their eyes in front of you because they thought you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov came up with the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to speak about morality on television .
he didn &apos;t talk about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women .
still , you could feel how people started to change in the city .
those who laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at first looked at you once with suspicion .
in time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I returned home I could sense how the situation in the republic deterior@@ ated steadily .
OC Media : what activity are you going to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as a activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organise te@@ et@@ re@@ els , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food tickets .
I don &apos;t pay any p@@ enny for that .
I discovered these people myself when I ap@@ preh@@ ended attri@@ butions .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ ro@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
this is how nature is , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to make you white with foam in front of your mouth that there are no ga@@ ys with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Da@@ ge@@ stan@@ er , who have the cab@@ ar@@ ins , who , the Russians also have , on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
here I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know , many think of transitions to men who love men and they believe that you change your sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different types of feeling to be precise , different attitudes of life .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to feel ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last few months there has been a strong increase in su@@ ici@@ des .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , into the li@@ mel@@ ight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who would like to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had lighted himself .
some people quickly managed to er@@ ase the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors couldn &apos;t do anything anymore .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab ich Tam@@ im - have appe@@ aled .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family @-@ pat@@ rons , who were hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution by the Iranian government , to feed their families and to pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which most of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ based Arab communities living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the domestic Arab population to make a living .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy assumed power and in 1925 under@@ took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable usable areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop only slowly , and the local population is getting little from this wealth .
it is often victims of un@@ treated diseases , hunger and priv@@ ations .
the Iranian regime is den@@ ying the Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ Arabs systematically in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a large number of dam@@ s , the water from the Arab areas to the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ating the devast@@ ation caused in the region , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries .
the unemployment rate among Arab a@@ haw@@ zi adolescents has now increased to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director General for Co@@ operative , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job have completed primary school , 55 % finished school , and 45 % have completed a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist with a resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ men .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans in Ah@@ wa@@ z and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
since function@@ aries and institutions prefer non @-@ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home country of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affili@@ ation with the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and to be questioned , as even Arab names wouldn &apos;t be tolerated at the workplace , let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing .
given the circumstances surrounding the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi , human rights activists strike alert before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world will wake up and take note of it .
the main reason for suicide is un@@ treated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why am I not identifying myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . released under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons License .
the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website of A@@ fro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I &apos;m not part of the movement .
they even lay well @-@ conceived scientific and social arguments in front of me , why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all fem@@ inists * inside .
for example , despite equal education , women still earn less money than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come to a glass ceiling sooner or later , and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still going through the many different countries and denom@@ inations .
all of this is well @-@ known to me .
I am convinced that I suffer twice and triple .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I come to talk about skin color , on black women , on black women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used under racism and discrimination , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lift up their voices and sing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of the women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they don &apos;t want to talk about the fact that there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist violence in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , which we are exposed to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other ethnic groups and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background often refer to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , I want all women , all men , and all men of all skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot join a movement as a black woman , in whose centre the white woman stands who refuses to consider injustice in her mind , which refers to both sex and skin color of a person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging to a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women over and over again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to uph@@ old an ideology in which the black woman is in historical respect a de@@ mented and margin@@ alized being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups who also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation in order to advance their ego@@ centric agenda .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of over@@ lap of skin color and gender . some of them will continue to keep silent about the importance of black women for the feminist movement no matter how many black women try to reward them for a better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and isol@@ ate themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to release myself fully and completely from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than using me for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before that we define black women for our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ anism : Rec@@ la@@ iming &quot; ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we rec@@ ap@@ ture ourselves ) speaks of the fact that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can in this way also create spaces where they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements that make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform themselves about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement , of which the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures , for in this paradigm I exist .
I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my being as a woman .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life is neither b@@ yp@@ assed nor ignored , nor rejected .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country are concerned that decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Water@@ borne Iraq &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - a subsidiary of Water@@ front Alliance - who works for it and works to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protect rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a sum@@ mar@@ ises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and published for En@@ sia of Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film maker and multimedia journalist based in Er@@ bil , Iraq .
the focus of her work lies on persecuted , poorly attended sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative video and new multimedia techniques , with which help supp@@ ressed congreg@@ ations can tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women represents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s murder in the country and in the region and to show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the abri@@ dged and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; by cur@@ sor . the article is part of the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer , which reports about violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the persons affected .
a police commission@@ er told A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent towards her .
since the end of their relationship , some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena due to mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez &apos;s informed announcement was of no av@@ ail .
a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
in general , women do not receive any support from the State when they report an ad@@ vert at all .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence should contact the law enforcement authorities at all .
content 1 Stri@@ ps and statistics 2 invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that nothing under@@ mine 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , inadequate implementation hits and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women are truly mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various data and reports that do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
however , the available numbers are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 District At@@ tor@@ ney filed an ad due to domestic violence . at 70 % of them , there was violence against women .
86 % of police officers came from women .
there were over 5000 advertisements due to domestic violence in the peace courts . 86 % of women &apos;s adver@@ ts came here as well .
in the advertisements , 40 % of women said that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of mental ill @-@ treatment .
these statistics , however , do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister , Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do so will come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are two women who do not do this because of physical abuse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the murder of women in Paraguay is not their own criminal off@@ ence , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country .
the co @-@ ordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay , every ten days a woman died due to violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want it , but gave up . this should always be regre@@ t@@ table .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer associated with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red psychological violence in his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most apparent :
I never thought I would become victims of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive because they let themselves be deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his insul@@ ts and ass@@ or@@ ted various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship , and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their posts , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen for so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment had at least some complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought with the authorities in Paraguay for nearly eight years to prove that her former partner ab@@ used her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all victims of abuse in any way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victoria &apos;s case everything began with psychological abuse .
her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he started beating them .
Vic@@ tori@@ as ads with the authorities remained without result and even from their relatives , they did not receive any support .
she led a trial against her former partner , who developed into an imper@@ me@@ able legal fight between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ay@@ ans laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but are not being applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the display of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is a way of resist@@ ances and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was deb@@ ated at the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , which was known as the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # fÃ¼r@@ st ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os movement are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original draft of the law stipul@@ ates that Fem@@ ini@@ de will explain to an independent criminal off@@ ence and punish harder as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the law text has been changed in some points , in order to also win MEPs for the law , which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions would be level@@ ed , which are currently banned in Paraguay and pun@@ ishable by up to five years imprisonment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original draft law had envis@@ aged the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence must be carrying by themselves , if they simply want to reimbur@@ se and receive a secure accommodation , to impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as a part of inter@@ personal relationships .
a change must take place here , so that violence is no longer seen as normal .
those who are silent in the face of these facts make themselves guilty and contribute to the fact that the offen@@ ders get away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must refund such a long ad until mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been modified , including a passage that the partners in cases of domestic violence called for reconciliation .
opinions about the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the submission of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law is regarded as a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

a year after the ban of a newspaper , independent media in Oman will continue to be exposed to attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed due to a resolution by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the US authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting of corruption in the sul@@ tan@@ te .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison where he is serving a one @-@ year prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and tried in court but were later released .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after having dismissed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at .
since then , besides his role as the only sul@@ tan , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sul@@ t@@ ans rule is characterised by the persistent efforts of the security forces , especially of domestic intelligence , civil liber@@ ties , including freedom of the press , to restrict human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists to in@@ timi@@ date and incar@@ n@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to freely express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the detention of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , in which since its inc@@ eption in 2007 , corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , stated that an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking Parties bind the hands of Justice &quot; was published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 .
in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to susp@@ end a verdict in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n on 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind hands of justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the Editorial committee , was charged with the ISS in front of the special department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS drew the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ az@@ i &apos;s arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the paper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper in any way , including online , was banned from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place before the court in Mas@@ kat .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were convic@@ ted , among other things , for distur@@ b@@ ance of public order , abuse of the Internet , and &quot; under@@ mining of the Pres@@ i@@ dency of the State . &quot;
in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a prohibition of publication and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year prison sentences and fin@@ es of 3000 US dollars each ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) , and a one @-@ year ban on the two journalists was imposed .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to one year prison and a fine of 1000 ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network to distribute material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a deposit of â¬ 5000 ( $ 13 000 ) was established and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted al @-@ A@@ br@@ i on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ silic@@ ate . al @-@ Ha@@ j remains in prison , where he serves his one @-@ year prison sentence .
in addition , the Appe@@ als Court rev@@ oked the decision by the Ministry of Information to close the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; newspaper .
despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to resume , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the Iranian government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued a statement extending the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed another order in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and the minister once again opposed the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to resume the publication of the newspaper .
the permanent closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the press freedom has been viol@@ ated recently in Oman .
other injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the country &apos;s first independent online newspaper , to cease operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Mexican authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Mexican authorities to :
1 . to release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j promptly and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3 . protecting the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman can exercise their legitimate human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ ans .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , the human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting the freedom of expression and association , and the right to gather , support and provide protection to them .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture taken with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not mentioned at all . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site : there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that are lacking in the global healthcare system , which cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have far more grave consequences in the poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment in resear@@ ching these diseases by drug companies is a major problem .
second , the research carried out by African scientists is helping build their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Center for Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
in the 1990s he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , especially when the AIDS epide@@ mic had a serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before deciding to go back home to support the S@@ Ã¡@@ mi Healthcare System .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the S@@ Ã¡@@ mi national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I have just launched a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GM : what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always be receiving add@@ res@@ sees instead of being a mo@@ ver .
the solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GV : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently well .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , as funding and development chances are better in other countries .
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , space exploration , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GM : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that pose challenges .
the system that magazines can only be used against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; ) also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how open @-@ source seed producers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 different varieties , such as Out@@ sh@@ rou@@ t , the first plant grown and eaten by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many types of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding .
the patents were not only applied to individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , special red or green or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
over the last few years , more and more such patents have been filed for more and more plants such as grain or car@@ rots . based on these trends , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production .
Mor@@ ton still breeds salad as a passionate expon@@ ent of a millen@@ nia of old tradition , but it takes longer since his work is increasingly complicated by more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s as if there &apos;s a b@@ oul@@ der in a river for which I have to d@@ ump@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have to do this now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go too far on salads .
and if they stand before the court , no one can breed any new type of salad , because all the characteristics are already patented . &quot;
however , he is very careful and endeav@@ ours not to use any material protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined forces in the United States and around the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( Open Source Bre@@ eding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts from the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red RÃ¶@@ mer@@ sal@@ at of the variety Out@@ sh@@ ofen in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station and ate . there it is tested , whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT field and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for Open Source seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted software .
it has been established to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders are bound to commit themselves to free use of the seeds they have bred .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others who buy their seeds , cross it to breed their own varieties , and not immediately sow - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
gri@@ m prospects
Professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are in control of seed and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
as a result , seed plays a role in greater contex@@ ts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg points out that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not occupy itself with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over seeds , &quot; he says . &quot; whoever wants to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables , should also know that the way this vegetables are bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without a seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to continuing to provide their seeds free of charge , as opposed to patent seed and plant traits .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is threatened because the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasingly abundant intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always available .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of the O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her PhD thesis with a genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all car@@ rot characteristics are protected as intellectual property , which makes it difficult for plant breeders either not or only difficult to use .
there are no such estimates for other plants yet , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that mass @-@ grown plants like wheat are patented in an even bigger style than salad or car@@ rots .
a Mat@@ ter of Vie@@ wing
plants are grown in such a way that they have specifically desired traits - from those through which their taste or colour improves to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing due to more and more patents . genetic diversity is more necessary at present than ever since changing conditions are much worse due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to tells C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions like the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the notion that intellectual property is limited to other breeders because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and protection of plant @-@ diversified products promote innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such protection thus prevents innovation , but encourages them by providing more material and expertise to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ ton looks different : wait 20 years until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly not foster innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to breed plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the fight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us forward and it will be impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in total , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant traits : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really create the characteristics themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants form it themselves and as a bree@@ der we have no idea how the plants do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a mystery of nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant breeders in the US state of Oreg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; whoever breeds a variety breeds his own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation it needs masses of her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , cul@@ min@@ ates in its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is just opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such as are active in international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) have patents , most of the smaller seed companies manage to survive even without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both are the case .

Mor@@ ton also believes that breeders by avoiding plant patents would be more innovative : &quot; it looks like I &apos;m using my efforts to produce something new , stronger than a company that patented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I constantly need new material for my catalogue , as I know that my ri@@ vals will sell my grades in a few years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a patent , you are protected from competition for 20 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the US seems to be a leader in open @-@ source breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly across the globe .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is launching an open @-@ source seed programme .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organization Agre@@ co@@ l is working on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( rules for breeding differ from country to country , therefore the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot be simply taken one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented . thus , it op@@ poses the current practice of the European Patent Office which allows patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend to pat@@ enting seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for open source seed systems for which the official start @-@ up should be expected next year .
an association of environmental and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report . it believes that farmers have the opportunity to come to seeds , exchange and improve the seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured .
the report also stresses the importance of a diverse local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context that by the Lu@@ by of O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon see him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has mainly focused on where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people realise that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the latest goals of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the Internet .
this time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of August 5 , the Egyptian government locked up the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ TRU@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports about the same .
in August , the Network published a statement on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities sharply critici@@ zed for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information persi@@ sts in spite of this attack and the ridi@@ cul@@ ing of the Egyptian right and the constitution by the authorities who are supposed to defend the law of freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world . even though it has never been so difficult to continue to pursue these goals , it has never been as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I proves that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the block@@ ade and not give in . we insist on fulfilling our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent M@@ ada Mas@@ r news site , the Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Al Jaz@@ e@@ era &apos;s network of alleged &quot; support for terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of wave of web@@ side barriers to victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to the AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt any more .
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of columns and articles he writes for Egypt &apos;s non @-@ accessible web pages and media .
now the blog , which he set up to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , became the goal of an attack .
B@@ logger , the provider with which Canada &apos;s blog is located , on the other hand , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while reporting about the student protests and taking a video on how police exercise physical violence against two students .
his articles focus mainly on politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada vo@@ iced the government &apos;s closure and reflected what this means for him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ Sis@@ i ; and even though the blo@@ gging of the blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) They have managed to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege ; A arrest , a tried murder , sum@@ mons to the National Security Council , the locking of blo@@ gs as well as any other website for which I worked .
2 ) They have proven that I did not write for nothing . in other words , my words have influence , albeit only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post items to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship .
now , however , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities blocked out websites from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . these resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at .
in addition , af@@ te documented the block@@ ade of providers possible through the b@@ yp@@ assing of Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
she reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how to block websites offering V@@ P@@ N@@ s .
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering content that Egyptian users could have access to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is worsen@@ ed by the fact that decisions are made behind closed doors , so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis to act against such acts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ orship , and whom will it attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day after day newspapers in Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the country &apos;s second largest city and home of numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school shot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves smoked chem@@ ist with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , marine and air@@ waves to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the 2017 violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian NGO Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is how the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published for detailed coverage of violence in Rio on 16 August published the editorial saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which they announced to set up a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the paper explains the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . all that happens from civili@@ zed standard and what is happening in Rio will be published in the category &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of crying : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative , so that as journalists we don &apos;t close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure :
it is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a newspaper writes that according to the Institute for In@@ ner Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 domains controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial , the newspaper writes :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to disgu@@ ise the atro@@ cities of the police who first shoot and then ask questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; does the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harm more than it uses ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an article on the Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil news portal , the journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is , in its opinion , a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold accoun@@ tability in the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated Extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of public service .
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the statistics of 2015 , Rio de Janeiro &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most violent spot in Brazil &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is wrong : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the mur@@ ders per state , Rio is ranked 16th , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia emphas@@ ises , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for many years .
these security policy measures included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to capture a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police custody and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , this indeed led to a decline in violent deaths . for several years , however , after several reports on sham@@ ans and repres@@ sions against poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire .
on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles in 2010 , explaining why the violence in Rio does not meet the criteria specified by the Geneva Con@@ ventions for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also ent@@ ails grave consequences for the people .
for this demands the state to use means and means which are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of an &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object of &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost bul@@ lets . &quot;
war back or forth , the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
a week ago , the police caught up the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besi@@ eg@@ ed Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops .
according to victories World@@ watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b .
the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 called for hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition go on the basis of UN investigations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas have been under siege in Damascus , leading to the fact that inhabitants are dependent on locally produced or smu@@ g@@ gled goods through tunnels and check@@ points .
through the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academ@@ ics will teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as to plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and conduct the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not part of the traditional food planted in Syria and are only extremely rare in Syrian cuisine . however , their food@@ stuff makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
head of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed its relief that it now gains more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to pass 125 families knowledge to grow mushrooms , according to Dr. Lei@@ la , Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of around â¬ 12.@@ 700 , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel shortage , locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production from the regions descend@@ ant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom @-@ yard in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms throughout East Gh@@ out@@ a for free .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach the people mushroom cultivation for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : break of siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for the production of new foods .
job creation , especially for women who work at home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities bound to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success and our fight against hunger and siege becomes visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of 2017 fires
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many district capitals in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ ici@@ a region in Spain , where there were 4 dead .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire breaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy happened in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured in the fires .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors forest areas via satellite ima@@ gery , some 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal by 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in four districts .
all Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a * ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017

the Imp@@ os@@ sible Trage@@ dy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was unable to cur@@ b the scale of the tragedy as much as possible
Jo@@ Ã£o ruler of the Con@@ federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal explained the paper P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ co :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they nowhere did this : there are dozens of reports of open roads that were surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened as in June , as the roads were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , building appro@@ vals in locations with high risk of fire are questioned .
a widespread proposal for the Wal@@ sh reform , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the construction activity of case to fall if the applicant had a means to self @-@ defence - that was an open back door so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val continues in the same article of the paper P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us drew attention to the fact that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of easily combus@@ tible wood , spread , like in a vi@@ cious circle , after fires of this kind more and more .
these problems add to the fact that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15 and 16 , when inhabitants sought information or attempted to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they used their own civil protection data using the application fo@@ ve@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ gade and was so critical in this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers didn &apos;t stand up to the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who persecuted the fires : the site counted more than half a million hits .

even if his mother did not say so at that time , she knew that she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more .
in the morning , the boy should break up .
his uncle would fetch him and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt un@@ protected suddenly .
the Taliban , known for their hatred , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his little wage and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mortar which were heavier than he himself , in order to earn his living .
back then , as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really tough , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ k rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , on which we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no service there and no heating . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we don &apos;t freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran and was ready to travel to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small un@@ inhabited island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his application for asylum , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
for some time A@@ shar@@ a was homeless , running alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid needy two times a day .
it is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high double rates . it is true , however , that the conditions for asylum seekers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the large majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised institutions in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially submitted an application for asylum - which can be passed for months after the application of the asylum application .
until then people who have no money for accommodation , either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was A@@ shar@@ k .
but his in@@ competent li@@ fes@@ pan helped A@@ shar@@ pen to get rid of these conditions soon .
after several years of working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ k put all his savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now a topic of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for employers in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
lots of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some Afgh@@ ans run companies , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
but A@@ shar@@ a &apos;s goals reach far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail and aim back to the country that he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , there are also opportunities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily , if I know that my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as all others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ shar@@ k also gre@@ ets plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; so they can sell their crop shots on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development to a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there is stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ k himself made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy &apos;s Ne@@ tizen report is an international sn@@ apshot that shows challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after regi@@ stering with a government agency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
users need to register in order to use social networks within six months of submitting the law decision on the authority &apos;s website stating their full name and ID number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who neglect this step could be sentenced to six months &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imprisonment or tri@@ bun@@ als of a penalty payment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law , which was applied by sixty Par@@ liam@@ entary members , is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May another MP filed a draft legislative proposal in which severe pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of the president or high officials would be introduced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the rule of law , such action would , however , be pun@@ ishable by prison sentences and fin@@ es , such as the legal experts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the law is passed , this can be up to three years in prison for the convic@@ ted .
in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) , arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup led by the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 participants , who had been arrested in the same incident , four years in prison for a trial date .
his trial was recently postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison administration , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the defend@@ ants from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty because of one , so many human rights groups agree , apparent burden of e.g. weapons possession , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza acqu@@ itted the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pun@@ ish@@ ments of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ ar@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous case , from 25 years to 5 years .
listen to Tunisi@@ an activists to le@@ aked documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was chi@@ ef@@ ly interro@@ gated to a res@@ ett@@ led action plan . said plan comes from the President of the Republic , which , according to the plan , explicitly supports a controversial draft bill that would guarantee business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption accused of corruption .
this document , published on 21 April on the Na@@ wa@@ at website , sheds light on how the presidential plans to support the legal state look like .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the mention of his sources under Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , which ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the case .
will China want to force the users of social media to show their identification ?
according to new rules of the Information Off@@ ices of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share messages in social media .
in the rules it is also stated that the registration with the full name will be required .
analysts believe that this will allow the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks . it is unclear until now how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; do we then see ourselves in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
not in Russia !
in May , state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat hes@@ itated to register as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organis@@ er of the information distribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the state government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to provide said services for the removal of content and force it upon request to susp@@ end user data .
these websites currently include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ gor@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has locking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ruled on Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey after Wikipedia ad@@ mins refused to clear two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication gave the page suspended because it became &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an information source working with groups to insti@@ gate a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website . it is , besides , among other things , China , one of the few countries in the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain cannot stop puff@@ ing up
following this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation on heigh@@ tened surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that de@@ code data encryption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services on the proposal but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in spite of all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and suggestions by members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of the Interior .
