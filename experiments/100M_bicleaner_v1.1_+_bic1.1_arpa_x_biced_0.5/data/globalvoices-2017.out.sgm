<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time now.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and practised his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter, who, with the help of Julia Roberts, covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate, who wanted to fill the highest federal court with judges who were interested in his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was trapped.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free from Method Man, "I was as if it was the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the U.S. only intensified.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are, and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very blackish love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">With his mind he never stops behind the mountain as one says so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague put it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted for him in droves.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican primaries was the highest number ever reached by the party nominee.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program that welcomes people from all over the world, a deeply believer person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trumpy Weltanschauung did not agree with Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the" "" "Phoenix Suns" "" "at the game." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance also contrasts with the generosity I experienced with Sandy Bahr, who fought the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still adapts to Kristi Kappes's commitment, which always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump made his way to the nominee Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out, however, that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white people, gave the presidency to a man, despite - or perhaps precisely because of his contempt for non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the trump-voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that those voters, of whom the majority know, have voted for Trump because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commentates on the cruel decision to raise a man looking down on those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "whitelash" (O.B. T): as much as "white against all other ethnicities"; pun of white in reference to the whites and whiplash, which means much like a whip lash, as the great Van Jones called, exactly killed what America has done so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background you may have, America means everyone welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country elected as its President, twice the son of an Kenyan, whose story, as he himself says, would not be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trump, however, there is a vast majority of the white America on this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" Mr. Khan inquired.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd responded with a loud" "" "no!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "would Muslims have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd roared." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried and their voices heard louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would anyone not like you have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and vocid" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded by saying: "thank God, Mr. Trump, that's not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son had fallen sent a message to him.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now trumps country, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, couldn't find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican Music School of the Vicente Guerrero Community in Oaxaca, with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music played in both places has not only changed the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with rubbish</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill site, only 16 kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists -but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now, La banda de Música (music band) plays in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and banal violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But after a coincidental encounter with a French pilot, who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare hope of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI writes:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with shining eyes and play in the bustle you learn to play trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpanes, bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from rubbish</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - play on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprepared instruments made up of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under management of Favio Chávez began to turn parts of waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, contrabasses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all of which were made of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage. children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin produced from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments of reprocessed material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentation called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic Mülldeponie) records the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates approximately one billion tons of waste each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Land fill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of rubbish-to-music all around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries demonstrate how technology and teamwork can successfully combat illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">Re-publishing takes place as part of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa it was known back then that this ship had already been fishing illegal fishing in Liberia's waters before it visited the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were correspondingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal offence of this species on its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comores, Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to take one of their harbours and refused to give him a fishing license.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to do everything," "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fisheries authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: he was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for pillage of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crisscrosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries set up in 2012 by the NGO stop Illegal Fishing (stop illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">Alongside Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries who had then expelled the prime minister from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and face each other where there is illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers technical support for FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can damage ecosystems which have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail's pace with information between individual countries, actions are happening in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communications platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There the individual countries can exchange, for example, lists of existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in prohibited areas. also, suspect routes can be discovered - such as those indicating that a ship loads his caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license, where they were on the way and possibly, if they have a criminal record.</seg>
<seg id="116">On the basis of this information, countries that are against illegal fishing may refuse to accept such vessels in their ports. meaning that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay for punishments, such as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it is then about significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is not profitable anymore." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that is what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to recover an estimated 20 million USD of lost turnover, which lost the eight members of the HISH-i network every year due to the illegal fishers entering East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, thus attracting the region's commercial fishing from all over the world. among these illegal fishing companies.</seg>
<seg id="122">Its practices include, among other things, actions such as sailing under false flag, fake license papers, imaginations, fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they purposefully use the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an unbridled control system," "" "says Long." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say 'Come to me'." "" "and this legal loophole attempts to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">The closed front has been working so far.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used multiple fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Based on its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that helps FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to detect the illegal vessels that are happy to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position," "" "says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO that also deals with fishery data and offers technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, switch off their automatic identification systems, which cannot be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">This is why Copeland helps build a system that connects different levels of information. it is intended to help FISH-i find criminally acting ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has launched the Global Fishing Watch platform, together with Google and the Oceana Marine Protection Organization, a platform that offers satellite data and which can display the position of each trackable vessel anywhere in the world.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors, to get a better picture of who is doing what, that makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to study." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global scale." "" "Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project in which a global system allows the pursuit of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only detecting criminals but also deterring them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that previously fished without a license and hardly had to reckon with consequences now know they are being observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have meanwhile registered a 33% increase in fishing net sales since fisher boats buy more licences.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to detect Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board towing nets, whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we have become a study object" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "they are now fighting illegal fishing, according to the exact same model as FISH-i." "" "With security, the aim is to develop even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia must report its first big triumph: in October it introduced Greko 1, a ship under false flag. and not only was the ship on the road without a license and were used tow-nets which are now forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship had also penetrated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "taking measures against Greko 1 is a strong sign that they act against illegal fishing," "" "Bergh says." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a special, collaborative way of working towards the protection of the oceans actually works across the world ocean. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London.</seg>

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are regarded as a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on President Nicolás Maduro's official inauguration.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture of María Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on the impeachment, the Venezuelans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country went into emptiness by assembling on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the recovery of Venezuela), pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - in the lowlands of Barinas, in the Andean regions of Mérida and Táchira, in the centrally located federal state of Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country is steadily deteriorating, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medication.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the inauguration of the current president Nicolás Maduro, but in the end the reluctance of a new election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, Contributors at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarizes the context of the government decision in its latest article:</seg>
<seg id="163">In the context of the social, political and economic crisis, where inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% to the end of the year) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine exists, the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to recapture its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The election alliance Massa de la Unidad Democrática or shortly MUD (like a round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces, called on the demonstrators to take part in the elections of 2015 to the majority of representatives of the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among other things, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is as far as Venezuela: morning National Assembly, Friday nationwide civil strike and on 3 November all to Caracas to Miraflores Palace.</seg>

<seg id="171">The pictures of the marches, which are published in real time, testify, among other things, an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country, but also disputes with policemen and supporters of the government.</seg>
<seg id="172">"" "one of the most frequently shared images shows a protesters calling through the shields:" "" "will you kill me because I am hungry?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter, images that tell of disputes, as well as reports of oppression and mistreatment, are piling up on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="177">Particularly large waves beat the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There the demonstrators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves from the police and armed advocates of the government according to their own statement.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop the police, including this woman in the Andean State of Táchira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in Táchira don't wear skirts because otherwise you could see something that many National Guards don't have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic makes the round that trains the scale of repression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the claim following an official inauguration process - it was now demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets.</seg>

<seg id="189">Others are evaluating these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government which, from their point of view, has done little against the devastating economic crisis and has preferred to refrain from critical voices:</seg>
<seg id="190">They took us so much - but also fear!</seg>
<seg id="191">Marches are increasing more and more in frequency and intensity.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 at Día a Día, an Argentinean news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities committed in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano now testified against his father as part of the great La Perla Ribera trial in the province of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial ended on 24 August 2016 for crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden to carry the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the prison of La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">He kept family secrets for 34 years.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I believed that this was okay.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child of 15 years, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time, I could not realise that my father was a thief, a torturer and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis Alberto was no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a gendarmerie. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 to 1978, at La Perla prison.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Archive recording.</seg>
<seg id="212">This is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who was charged with kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10 year old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos's son, a man who over the years recognized the extent of the atrocities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a Federal Constitutional Court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows the great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of redemption.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall with us. there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and called on me to identify my boyfriend.</seg>

<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I looked in, and saw a couch that was tortured by men.</seg>

<seg id="346">Adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can prolong their driver's license, last month witnessed a particularly mislucky translation.</seg>
<seg id="348">"" "the Japanese word was found on a shield, which means" "" "older drivers" "", "the" "" "older car driver" "" "- perhaps also with an evil hind and # 8212; as" "" "terrible motorists" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Levine, which has been widely shared in social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto-based daily Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could it come to such an English translation?" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "this is an insult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto, simply unacceptable," "" "said Holmes." ""</seg>
<seg id="356">The erroneous English translation was first removed. the designation "horrible drivers" was later replaced by the appropriate, albeit grammatically not quite correct designation "elder drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of Kyoto prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported the apology as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we sincerely regret that elderly people felt offended by inadequate correction (the translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online intelligence service J-Cast News addressed a little more detailed with the phenomenon of "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "awful" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents across the country are a cause for concern." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, in 2005, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors. this corresponds to a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors created 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">This increased their share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has decreased overall, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors has increased in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">In the article published on Yahoo, the named reporter brought comments to the light showing which prejudices some Japanese apparently hew against older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on Yahoo regarding the translation error was, among other things, the following comments:</seg>
<seg id="368">"" "-" "" "Is this (" "" "terrible motorists" "" ") not the reality?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="369">"" "-" "" "So faulty is the translation really not, isn't it?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translating, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the starting text and active language skills in order to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active command of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general, the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the source language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their mother tongue, who could translate the translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of the translation, cost estimation or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that do not have foreign employees can still make translations internally. then, the Japanese employee, whose English language is considered the best, is the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and enigmatic sentences generated by machine translation have shown that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time. this applies especially to some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic prints, which often decorate t-shirts or bags, are used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least innocuous as jewellery. but from large companies or government which have the means to ensure higher standards, more careful translations can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully make use of a more serious source for its translations.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Naveed con Libertad" (Free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users announced that they would not have access to Vivoplay online transmitters.</seg>
<seg id="393">Other users later wrote that the internet appearances of VPITV and El Capitolio TV are no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online transmitters also carried out recordings of the protests in Caracas which were organized by opposition groups opposing the government Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroute. he pointed out that the connection was snapped and recommended the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Zenit: enables your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that websites of Venezuelan providers are once again blocked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the @ VivoPlayNet site.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular among Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to report protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunications threatened them with fines and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission regarded this as a "call to force."</seg>
<seg id="402">I have registered with @ vivoplaynet without cable TV and informative national TV channels.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is astonishing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VESfiltro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible due to a blocking of the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online transmitters. this also concerns the website where the National Assembly delegates its meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that local internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS servers answer requests for specific domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server responds poorly or refuse to request such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS-lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplay.de</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third locked channel, the broadcast was suspended on Thursday, 6 April, when the VPITV camera man Elvis Flores, who carried the protests in Caracas live, was arrested.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates Internet connections: this makes the Venezuelans access to multimedia reporting on current events in the country more and more difficult.</seg>

<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family living there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation from university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one from which something has become" "", "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she began to work as a Criadin for the family. in Paraguay the more than 46,000 boys and girls were forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money passes their underage son or their underage daughter to another, more rich family. in exchange, the child gets food, an education and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned is that children must pay countless days of domestic work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be abolished.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice called Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a couple of years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Crimean tas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that Crimean tas is inoculated guarantees in general silence.</seg>
<seg id="429">"" "" "" "the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," "" "explains Alvarenga." ""</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family who is their daughter in the belief that they complete their education, improve their position in society and can "make something out of themselves" can be handed over to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who assimilates the girl with her and justifies its exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be starved.</seg>

<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín came to the hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed signs of violent blows.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was in the household of the former military hospital Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Population Register.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira stayed with a stick on Marín until she suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Criadin.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela took responsibility for the practice of the Criadazgo, rooted in the Paraguayan society, for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">"" "they called the Criadazgo as a" "" "modern form of slavery" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people gathered for protest demonstrations and demanded that there be "no more Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," said Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without documents it is much easier to violate the rights of children unpunished.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations called for a swift investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criadin.</seg>
<seg id="453">When the case comes to court, the case of Carolina Marín could be landmark - for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo comes to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Crimean</seg>
<seg id="455">The Crimean tas are exploited not only as workers, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the farbik party in which her father worked, had to bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work all the time and began selling sweets on the street or on the market in order to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to the school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital Asunción as a Criadin.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of their employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Fridays for example, she cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and infected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more it was done with learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But even this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but also didn't have unlimited meals. "I was allowed to get more books from the master's library as food from the fridge," she recalls.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathiser of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party that belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>

<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made for them, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="474">But she was perfectly clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also in school, Alvarenga has been discriminated against. "one thing that is almost never talked about is bullying and the harassment that Crimean tas are exposed to when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a Criadin.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone to my home. I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood.</seg>

<seg id="505">Within six months with the adoption of the law, users would have to register their correct names and ID numbers on the website of the site to use social networks.</seg>

<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is accepted as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should account for users the registration. unclear is also how they should account for those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>

<seg id="527">Why is this particular kind of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"" "as Raza shows in the video," "" "the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "" "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predator." ""</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to actually see a Persian leopard in the wild is low and goes against zero. when the team in the video shows that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011 and the region is still occupied with reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, the head-of-the-line daily Kahoku Shimpo, has progressed to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011. a huge earthquake, a tsunami and an nuclear accident in Fukushima caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi prefecture was one of several prefectures in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring counties Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated by sevens, because the tsunami had all coastal towns disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">For this reason, the Fukushima prefecture has experienced a nuclear accident, even so, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from a local perspective which progress has been made six years later in order to rebuild the lives of the local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authorities and survey results of those concerned themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of planned replacement houses (for the most) were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi experienced the greatest success among the three prefectures, and 80 percent of the planned spare houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses while Fukushima represents 70 percent of the total light.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, even six years after the catastrophe, Evacuated dormitories (for the most part, casetsu riutaku) were relocated to final replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the threefold disaster, nearly 80,000 people were forced to live in shelters shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate still lived in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of those who were evacuated from Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters while Miyagi was more successful.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The status of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper found out, 1074 of 1100 schools, affected by disaster, opened their doors by December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later it is clear that industrial rebuilding in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 per cent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are in operation again, only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resumed their operation in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident occurred extensively in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural lands, with only 66 percent of farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent of the farmland destroyed in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land of Fukushima are located in the nuclear lock zone.</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has largely recovered, but Fukushima remains far away.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are back to 90 percent on the same level as before disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only show up to 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coast inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to be able to determine the overall picture, the newspaper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and under the evacuation system. she asked her about the status of reconstruction and how her indignation changed from the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In their introduction to the article Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to find out more about the tsunami consciousness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of those surveyed find that there was still not enough of disaster prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands for those who had to be evacuated from the prefecture of Fukushima</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuation people from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience not only the huge earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also a witness of the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160,000 evacuees from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were relocated to areas outside of the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, had been resettled into permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 stand still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima live outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">Most of the evacuation centres in the disaster areas are older than 50 years old. it is known that the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people meet people from other countries who speak a different language, the differences seem to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often sees that one connects more than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices podcast, we are watching these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast we treat subjects that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who recall a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Emakers explains how the love of music has consolidated its affection for the Iranian culture; Violeta Camarasa speaks about the time she worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week: last Friday, a police officer had struck him against his head during a demonstration in Goiânia. millions of demonstrators participated in a protest march against austerity measures throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studies social sciences at the University of Goiás, suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>

<seg id="599">The local journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which spread rapidly within a few days in Brazil.</seg>

<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officers, as he suggests in Goiânia with his baton on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>

<seg id="607">For the Mateus family living in another state, Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilians (approximately 2,700 euros) to cover a portion of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Goiana while he is in hospital.</seg>

<seg id="613">Goiás experiences a wave of political violence: here the activist Guilherme Irish was assassinated by his father because he supported the Occupy movement in secondary schools. here, the military police of a WhatsApp-group was killed, only to criminalize teachers, and now we have the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who is on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a policeman who struck him with a baton.</seg>

<seg id="617">Flavio Serafini, Socialist and Peasant Party (PSOL), asked the police to renounce violence against demonstrators via loudspeaker announcements.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country.</seg>

<seg id="621">On the other hand, the O Globo preferred a cover story with a burned-on bus.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also be recognised if you are strictly against any kind of material damage.</seg>

<seg id="625">The Remembrance of Forgotten Villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba concluded the doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The popular village Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - notwithstanding that there is no significant sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities in sugar cane factories have been paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After exhaustion, the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute to the factories every day.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier's veteran, who stands every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which are in operation after a long period of inactive time, because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene recalls that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry withstood the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, inefficiency, poor management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the amount produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are not news anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the community saw even better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they became unsustainable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories which could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis in the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the price of sugar rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugars will remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 report "Agricultural Prospects" issued by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), raw sugar exports would generate about 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will certainly go into history," "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the shutdown of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people, received their full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeats most is "scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents said the same thing: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first year of the year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was official documents which differed only with regard to the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on the responsibility was over and the letters came more and more frequently.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the shut-down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane mills that were still in operation," he insures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, is waiting for retirement in another plant, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was against his will in the decommissioning of the factory, in whose construction he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With each part he removed, he dismounted one of his 31 years of work.</seg>
<seg id="668">The most developed industrial area of Cuba and most important worktops was wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, there were no alternatives to the jobs and services generated in the communities in which they were located.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know whether during the mammoth speech of October 21, 2002, the then President looked into the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years, everything would go well.</seg>

<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory closed, or rather, when they began to disregard it, they also stopped asphalting the road, which also disadvantaged other establishments.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to look for other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They became spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">Without a perspective for the future, many young people also left the region.</seg>
<seg id="679">In the area a food factory was created, whose production does not even serve for the supply of the community.</seg>
<seg id="680">The ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive.</seg>
<seg id="681">At the end of 2016, Nene came back to the Boris Luis Santa Coloma plant, the ruins of the place where he began to work.</seg>
<seg id="682">Forty-nine yields to the old soldier a pension of two thousand peso per month to spend the years in retirement in Mañalich.</seg>
<seg id="683">Mr. Nene, a man of black skin color, small, with few teeth and clear voice, is not a supporting person, yet he does not give up the lies he told him.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do it using hip-hop, thanks to a number of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios to schools and youth centers in 2014 to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the educator David Hodges who lives in Montreal and worked with ten cree communities in northern Quebec and then collaborated with the Cree hip-hop group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop thus increases that the young participants explore topics such as "cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-acceptance," or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the tribe of the Kitsumeb First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a road section in Westkanada, where almost two dozen indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalization is.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youths do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars hip-hop-group, who gave them a stopper in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available, as is a translation into English, translated into German here:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise someday</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and go forward as well as our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">This is how they can do what the Creator determined</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what is exactly on the menu are displayed near the entrance to shokuhin sanpuru (for example, "plastic models of the dishes") of any dish that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they can enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the tokioter neighbourhood of Kappabashi, there are a variety of small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so ordinary that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend is turning them into conspicuous cell phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new mobile phone ribbon adornment decorated with plastic dishes, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyo department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kitschy collectives, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a couple of Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "" "" "the new boom in food inventory is becoming more and more complex." ""</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an emperor-don (a favorite rice bowl with seafood) was turned into a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular dish (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple peeling your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comical.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some Handy-stand and mobile-designer allow you to create your own work of art. in this case, ikura or Lachsrogen is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my cell phone with salmon cheated?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest cell phone stand has the shape of melancholy ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other quirky plastic dishes can be seen at: itinii's Naver matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # smartly rate.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district Cappabashi, which is dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missing and killed regularly only appear in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The report on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the mourners or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every body, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">That is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project "apprena Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "dealing with drug trafficking") that is intended to give these victims a voice and stories of people who were fighting between law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime not only lets us fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and therefore have to drive entire communities for many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>

<seg id="759">"" "a video entitled" "" "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" "" "(German:" "" "how afraid life changes" "" ") tells exactly these stories." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father looking for secret graves after his son every weekend.</seg>

<seg id="773">The editors of "appoina vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and leadership.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of animal político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered as normal, no matter in what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I've known disease and sensationalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come across newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with images that can only come from a textbook for criminology or of specialists from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one being disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealer) if he is tall. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the lack of humanity is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by the fact that they were" "" "rebellious." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to say they are spared from such tragedies when they don't touch and are silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months blackmail in the Capital District: how a family was sacked with threats." it describes how armed criminals were squeezing money from their business month for month until they destroyed not only the business but also tore their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain of this never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact you if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when to kidnap you or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days, whether cry would resolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article" "" "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation-marked generation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organized crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it possible to grow in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he tells us he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, cook potatoes, make tortillas warm and make Chichi for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of age.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, the bloody corpse of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, as violence perpetrated by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Council of Public Safety and the Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor had 3103 murders. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that survived the organized crime in Mexico and invade the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we must not forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "apprena Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Político launched the data journalism project Narcodata in 2015, whose aim is to portray the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking that has tormented the country over the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="817">"sharing is Caring" by Flickr user Niklas Wikström (CC-BY-NC 2.0) WARNUNG: this article and the pages with which it links, contain images on which violence is represented.</seg>
<seg id="818">The fact-check is important at a moment when it comes to lifting a rumor or exposing a falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the year after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether it is true or untrue, tends to continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its initial publication, it has been misleading to convert tragedies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false link between picture and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample coverage of events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a tanker crossed the village of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipping around and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war Africa's second largest country has been neglected for years and devastated. the roads in the region have become dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank truck fell victim to it.</seg>
<seg id="828">Government officials described a fireball that enveloped dozens of houses, including a movie theater that was full of people who watched the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burnt and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture entitled "This is Nigeria." from the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12th January 2015.Several photos of the incident will depict the horrible scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">There are rows of charred bodies that are lined up on the ground while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo has been suspended several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses dramatically reported atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one stayed behind to count corpses," "" "said a people to Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images could the follow-up time be illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="844">The attack was also unsolved, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the image of the DR Congo reappeared, when it was wrongly presented as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of misappropriations; Africa Check has been documenting assignments for Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal comments such as this example falsely accrue the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Rohingya Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash of lightning, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee were beaten, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported about the violence against the Rohingya, posts like the following, which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo, appeared:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news site, which in 2012 falsely claimed that the president of Myanmar's Thein was said to have participated in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image of the DR Congo to view this information.</seg>

<seg id="917">USA, 2015.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and Pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (framing) that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with Muslims or - to the defence of Muslims - the murders of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing takes the picture to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question, however, is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are tens of people who inadvertently share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this mood of misinformation and misinformation that actual atrocities are untrue and adorn the real horror of what has actually happened in DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated extensively (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that refusing images of a refusal is equivalent to recognising the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent imagery is desensitizing readers and viewers and taking them the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigates how violent media work to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media, the fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be used diversely from the context or in a completely abusive way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, each study of incorrect attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e. g. insurmountable) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or at all difficult to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are such words in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these invaluable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobrekah).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all stubbornly resist every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">One word or expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists cover Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird chose to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from Vanuatu's Mwotclap language, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Customize your parents in recognition of what has been done for you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - the comfort or laziness that you feel after getting warmed up in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds own words about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They defuse other cultures, reveal other thoughts and arouse our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page want to publish more of these "invaluable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>
<seg id="958">Speakers of the Treasure Languages, appreciated by untranslatable, are invited to upload their favorite words here.</seg>

<seg id="972">After an opinion of the disaster centre of Sri Lanka from May 28, 2017, 126 people were killed and almost hundred people are missing because of the floods and mud waves.</seg>
<seg id="973">More than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday (26 May) and around 100,000 people were transported to 304 safe places of residence.</seg>
<seg id="974">Rain falls on Saturday (27th May) and the water levels in some areas slowly declined.</seg>

<seg id="1002">I have already brought this conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1003">People with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sahar they know - of the widespread concept of "Muslims" that has built up in their imagination.</seg>
<seg id="1004">They devitate me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't all look alike.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves with being a Muslim in different ways. but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims, like me, do not fit into it, are dismated.</seg>

<seg id="1011">I don't stand alone.</seg>

<seg id="1017">The Qur'an and the Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But in the Western imagination, the religion of Rumi was erased, as well as from the most popular translations of its poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deleting makes a large part of the history of the 1,7 billion Muslims in this world.</seg>
<seg id="1020">Another is in the reductionist paintings of Muslims that have already colonized Western books for centuries.</seg>

<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognise that if French, Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings, and Saudi, Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body, both of which are two sides of the same coin.</seg>

<seg id="1032">This narrative has studded our collective imagination so deep and erroneous that often Sikh-men and children become the target of anti-Muslim attacks and harassment.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of these stories, which we tell and about the way we tell them, Islamophobia today is not just fear of Islam, religion, but it is fear of the "other."</seg>

<seg id="1131">Why am I telling this here at this TEDx Talk 2017 in Stanford, where, however, Edward Said, the man who showed us how wars are waged and people are beamed through the work of the "other" in the public imagination, four decades ago even scientist of Stanford was.</seg>
<seg id="1132">We have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of consciously and unconsciously doing the "other"; just as my girlfriend and I committed in the rain during the Women's March, because the occupation that we have no president to feed chocolate cake while he already bombed countries and "other made" people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>
<seg id="1133">It starts here with all of us.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Recently, Global Voices reported a new initiative by Steven Bird, an insurmountable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the variety of languages of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States where TLS has already carried out events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project, the following applies:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world languages can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - secure spaces in which inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong to.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listen often to understand" "" "these events instead" "" "listen to feel" "" "to" "" "feel" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers introduce their history first in their own language and then translate them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their devotion and depiction lead to the presence of the audience.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this turn, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of the narrative art that are typical for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamara tells the tale of the rabbits and the baboon in the language of Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after explaining the meaning of his fable, John Nyamus ara is asked:" "" "how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" "" "with a wide grin, he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">They listened to you!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. all those who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own story-telling performances.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the goal of reviewing the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, several religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on April 3, 2017; the march started at the puertorian Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went to the Plaza de Colón in the oldtown of San Juan.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (Civic Front for the Neural Auditing of Debt) and the Ekomenic church assembly Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the re-determination of debts also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people Puerto Rico claims that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debts are responsible for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">"" "" "" "we call for a financial audit and a management committee with no personal interests in the public debt, with a fixed, our working conditions corresponding compensation, which acts in favour of the economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are blackmailed and oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people Puerto Rico refuses to pay a debt which is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not find themselves with falling pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate measures.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - is suffering from a serious financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Hence the so-called "Center for New Economy," a non-profit non-profit organisation with a focus on socio-economic development, proposes a law on national responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state supervision.</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">From the outside imposed measures will run without the participation and conviction of citizens in danger of being rejected by the people.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members continue to campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he has provided for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on the digital culture that is hosted in Berlin, an event of the # FreeBassel campaign was dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director of Book Sprints, a publishing house published by so-called 'Book Sprints' finished books within three to five days, read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Surgical Research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and is available here license-free, contains a number of articles dealing with the free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up and what the true costs are with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense from our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was deleted from the Adra Prison's directory in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that pushes for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom, right away.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has allowed many of us to start thinking about their own fates, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown location from the Adra prison, a non-military institution.</seg>
<seg id="1202">"" "his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" "" "military police" "" "had taken the basis of a" "" "top secret" "" "command of the military court from his cell in Adra." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by persons who presented themselves as an inside of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, his place of residence and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologists and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded the Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bastian cultural prototypes was more provisionally than the work he started with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilisations, and here Greek-Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel could not yet know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put everything on it, to wipe out this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysria but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into the digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English, even when he was already in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a prosabbath that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and translated them from Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1225">Book cover from Youssef Abdalki.</seg>
<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to the public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here is an excerpt from the book of Nora entitled "It happens":</seg>

<seg id="1230">That I lose sight in the moment in which we embrace,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That I don't care about any of the dangers,</seg>

<seg id="1247">Bastian history is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against regime Bashar al-Assad, more than 65,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Until 2016, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, at least 17.723 Syrians have died in prison since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Today, we reiterate our claim in the hope that we must do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">"" "Mozambique:" "" "due to corruption condemned director after release" "" "back to previous post" ""</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted to a corruption case in which a member of the government returned after half his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus where corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other defendants due to embezzlement of 54 million Metikal (about 800 000 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was made by Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good leadership and immediately called for his return to the company, which happened on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which submitted the motion, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza to resume his old post, as the company did not complete any disciplinary proceedings following his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not mean the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, in an interview with Deutsche Welle condemned the company's decision to put the director again:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should have initiated a disciplinary procedure against the infringement.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company apparently was silent and did not take reasonable legal steps to apply the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" "" "contradictory" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza were a competent guy, he would be a consultant, after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had been cut off.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could give lectures and motivational speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza will gladly pay for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Disgusting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says that the director does not have any morals:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him. I can't believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insulted the state so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lack moral return and serving the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead has only served by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as if it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeut prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remember that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">They belong to Samora machel prison and will not only be remembered as the first independent president, but also as a sharp, one-edged and - by the way - prophetic speakers.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral presentations was when he strongly affirmed that "an ambitious man is capable of all, even the fatherland for his ambitions to sell his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said, "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that he is not. he changes tactics, but he doesn't turn away from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">"" "an ambitious man is criminal at the same time." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored a lot of users wrongly</seg>
<seg id="1287">"" "the Burmese word" "" "Kalar pae" "" "means chickpea or splitting." ""</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network picked up their posts from the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East India, or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censored the word "Kalar" or, as part of an initiative, to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma on the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the ascension of radical nationalist movements gave the word an extremely abject connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as a hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt for the purpose of its use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Furthermore, there are several Burmese words with different meanings, which have the same sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, throne is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (splitting), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kaleiaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboobutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' such:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was extinguished today because it contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way if they knew how to relieve his back pain by doing a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The proposition ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burma - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is of the opinion that it will reduce the hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytic before it extinguishes all posts that are suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (splitting bsen).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who are spreading hate speech have a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to cut off their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all who disseminate hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords is often a scratch and mouse game, whereby users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternate spelling of censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat describes how Facebook began to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... as I became aware of this new policy of Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting, posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post "did not meet the Facebook Community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intent or simply try to show their opinions against the hate speeches of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Mail without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese internet community asking for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a benevolent intention to lessen racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring even more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "it also seems that they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned such words as" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "pea curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to rectify the falsified hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they only had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that gave them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">"" "" "" "Facebook censorship" "" "has provided users with a lot of mockery." ""</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users are now making fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken away from the network.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that didn't contain a hate speech, but were removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "the Burmese lyrics are" "" "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word" "" "Kalar" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">The post states, "If you are a doctor, then heal people?"</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should additionally heat the violence in Myanmar's communities, especially in Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">"" "" "" "Facebook has been criticised for its failure to bring the balancing hate speeches on its Burmese pages under control." ""</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of just censoring the word 'Kalar' it would have been better to look closer to context than on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided against the child marriage - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent that contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA Copyright Law in the USA, internationally dim.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month now Turkey has been blocking the popular Encyclopedia of Wikipedia, based on the crowdsourcing principle.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day, it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series oppose the blockade.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to use bypass tools for blocked web pages (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN-prevalence of the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008, as has recently been described in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University has been taking place regular blockings since 2007, after the internet law (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, several Mirroring Pages (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated) are now surfaced.</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform exposes all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network, which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is, however, irrevocable in spite of legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about its efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After listening to the news (about the locking of Wikipedia), we put all the snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the content in a decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia articles, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also stated that this step was carried out independently from the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, an aberrant page of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mise pages when locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member and staff at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One accesses to another URL, which is not the original. that which one sees then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server further directs the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so that it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia itself when it is locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Because this is done by a server not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A suhlending rhinoceros, Chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with poorly positioned motifs and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivates him to carry a camera himself and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Neptune's wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown right next to Chitwan National Park offers him the perfect opportunity to take photos that draw attention to Neptune's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this prime location helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just stopped at home when I suddenly called to Navarre (the manager of Chitwan Gaida). he had received a call from my father that a leopard would be on the banks of the Rapti River.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had observed him and showed me the place on the other river side, where the leopard was located and I immediately began to knead pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to co-operate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he was to know it, for he stood up against tigers face to face, saying,</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the boy appeared. he sat down immediately, we look at us and he stares me through the scarf-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on its photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepal's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and usually lived in a tent in order to take pictures of Ottern in Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photograph of birds living near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of a content-sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, it is possible to avoid women with the greatest care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead they use a pronoun or say" "" "father of my child." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women admit that because of the social pressure they should respect the husband, as well as the fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm, get this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto from the Indian State Odisha was convicted by a fake court and rejected by her family and the village community after addressing a married family with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives also not by name is also common among men. however, they have far fewer remittances to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, joined a unique club and became the main topic of the city quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, it is part of # KhelBadal's campaign, which is operated by the community of Video Volunteers and advocates for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paist has been working with the help of her video camera for seven years on the discovery of practices such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV and AIDS infected individuals, and leads these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It tells of how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion was of women who do not call their husbands name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to speak out loud on the names of their husbands, is a custom that they are fully responsible and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition attests that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is considered as deceitful, a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deep-rooted that we never thought about this round of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband at her name, wanted to try at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him now by his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this confidence in luggage, Rohini started its first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion going.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to tell her husband's name with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, affectionate and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked all" "" "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, does that mean they don't respect us?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to bring their husbands name over their lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking a century-old tradition in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she only kneaded in front of her during the whole exercise; another decided to release the whole strained frustration against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on her faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in an adrenalin rush about having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to name their husbands at home.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the coming days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the women upside down: his wife could not stop telling his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law was staring her, she got scared and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said:" "" "Rohini thought I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A woman's husband was less understanding and the situation was in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the cinogenic red dot on the forehead that shows the marital status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I told my husband that I would wear the zinok-red dot if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only, and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped completely, but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make an excursion at every discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear what they hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months, for the first time in their lives, they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, such as our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things aloud, no matter how small they are.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is associated with the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only carried saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most people this is okay, but some wanted to wear a Salad-Kurta, a wide shirt over a pair of trousers, they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own clothing choice, the morals associated with the Saris and much more, Rohini smuggled her own pair of Curtas (shirts) into a discussion round so that the women could wear it.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to take a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only made small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then they stopped saying the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including myself, are still doing it, but only if they are alone and no other family members are there.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now carry Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggling around more freedom of movement or the choice of clothing - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1549">On June 29th of this year, the hashtag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend, where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a reversal in the Japanese culture of the post-war period.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who exclusively interviewed the Beatles in 1964 in London, noted in 2016 on the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just about five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">People here quickly became aware that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many well-known Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," said Ryuichi Isaka, President of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning! today the Beatles Memorial Day is in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Even today songs from the Beatles are sung in Japanese karaoke bars and in English classes at Japanese secondary schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The Beatles kitsch survives everything.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today is Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love the Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">I don't know if this "Winnie the Pooh" doll is supposed to represent John Lennon or not.</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it belongs to fans, Japanese naturally also make pilgrimages to the known places connected with the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">If you love the Beatles, these are your 5 places you absolutely have to visit.</seg>
<seg id="1564">1) Abbey Road</seg>
<seg id="1565">2) Matthew Street (in Liverpool)</seg>
<seg id="1566">3) Strawberry Fields (New York Memorial)</seg>
<seg id="1567">4) Penny Lane</seg>
<seg id="1568">5) (From the link) The Beatles Story (Museum), Liverpool</seg>
<seg id="1569">The pilgrimages can sometimes not be comical enough:</seg>
<seg id="1570">Good morning together.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Today is Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1572">Exactly today in 1966 the Beatles came to Japan for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the film K-On! went on a pilgrimage to London and walked over Abbey Road.</seg>
<seg id="1574">We did the same last year.</seg>
<seg id="1575">And of course some companies also use the fan base in terms of market-technology, such as this Ramen-Shop (Ramen are Japanese noodles) in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Good morning, here is Mutahiro Koya Ramen!</seg>
<seg id="1577">And what could that be for a day?</seg>
<seg id="1578">"" "I will listen to" "" "Yesterday" "" "today and eat Ramen noodles at Mutaro Koya." ""</seg>

<seg id="1583">Zambézia's police warned the population that bald men could be targets of attacks in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1584">Photo: different Bolin / Flickr, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of individuals for organ trafficking, probably for superstitious purposes, concerns the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found beheaded and part of the organs had been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently confessed that the organs of shamans were used in Tanzania and Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is the local superstition that the head of a bald man can contain gold or bring wealth, the police spokesman of Zambézia of the BBC explained.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, which is the target of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo by Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which was probably made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on 8 July 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009 Liu was sentenced to 11 years "imprisonment for" Subversion "(state endangering) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto claiming the democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to the case as" "" "an internal matter" "" "and a narrator says that he deemed it" "" "not required to discuss this matter with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">However, China continues to receive calls from the international community, Nobel prize laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to allow him to do a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press summarized a number of reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations, United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">A spokesman, however, refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende have refused to answer questions about Liu's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to a standstill after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government shared that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to re-record the salmon trip to China, since exports have largely been blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed hope for an unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The leaders of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also urged China to release Liu, as she shared in an Declaration on June 30:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to lift all restrictions of Mr. Liu's wife and family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all visits that they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>

<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman of the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced on 27 June the AFP news agency that the message would appeal to the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but also to liberate his wife Liu Xia from house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the US Embassy's request attracted a furious response from China, with the Foreign Ministry's statement that" "" "no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley told China that China should offer the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice, which they claim according to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The US senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to unconditionally release Liu and his wife.</seg>

<seg id="1659">Germany, Germany</seg>
<seg id="1660">German spokesman Steffen Seibert wrote on 3 July, Berlin hope that Liu will receive all the medical support he needs and that a "humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority."</seg>
<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping was on July 7 and 8 at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources reported in Beijing of the Reuters news agency that China had great concerns about whether the fuss surrounding Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada - Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum requested China to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius attorney told AFP earlier that Liu's wife Liu Xia could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to speak and contact anyone outside, including his lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to tell:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and release the rights reserved for the exercise of these rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="1668">France, France</seg>
<seg id="1669">In an Declaration on 29 June, France's Foreign Office urged China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs, regardless of where he is. furthermore, his wife and family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information out whether France will finally accept it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan Republic of Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">"" "" "" "the Council of continental affairs in Taiwan urged China on 27 June to release Liu and show a greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means in order to demand political reforms and democratic development." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislator, Yu-Mei-nu, of the governing Democratic Progressive Party also urged China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual guide in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned about Liu on 28 June and admitted that many asked him to pray for Lius well being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he was severely punished, led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt personally very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed the Charter 08 that stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association, the Minister observed that many people criticised the dominance of Singapore's only political party because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported Singapore to be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody asked if New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That's it, most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "turn logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian regime of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we can say that we are ultimately not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very classy: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries' in the face of that, it seemed invariably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defends the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally towns that are permanently guided by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core of the subject, the good old lyre comes up from authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end the last week of Shanmugam was given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He disguised appropriate questions with non-answers of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng asks Shanmugam to clarify his opinion, as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point, provided that it was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his comment on the blog, he points out concerning the critics that one should start reading the entire address of the conference, so that the context of the statements of Shanmugam could be better understood, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the notes.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the elections in Singapore are so uneven if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">When he said that Singapore was not a country, it obviously didn't mean it in this sense!</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who, as the leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it is properly associated and aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review discovers the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "has Mr. Shanmugam" "" "committed a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudian spokesman?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only considered an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, which country will the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government cabinet, Mr Shanmugam's statements are of great importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore have their military service, do they defend only their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay back our Prime Minister's bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink ID card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">The magazine Journey of a Decade is tending to Bejahung, Singapore and has always been a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"" "" "" "I didn't say what I said..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1730">This proposition seems to have angered many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said Singapore is a country.</seg>

<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>

<seg id="1745">"" "my clarification usually follows the standard answer:" "" "Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ice Hockey, Nature." "" "many Canadians probably cook with anger when they are held for Americans, but I don't mind that." ""</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know, there is little that differentiates us Canadians of Americans.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop band, famous in Thailand, published a music video that parogues the junta, which took power in 2014 and, in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government, continued to govern the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">"" "the new song" "" "Dictator Girl" "" "(Phadet Girl) of the band tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about the rules he makes his girlfriend." ""</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not specifically politically, the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video for the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Within the first three days alone, the video uploaded to Facebook was divided 1,254 times and received 8,800 likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video "The Dictator" in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists invited the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially how it behaves with the situation of the country under the junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at those videos that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has stubbornly pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"" "the" "" "44 rules of the girls" "" "may refer to the draconian section 44 of the provisional Constitution, which gives absolute discretion to the commander-in-chief on important national issues." ""</seg>

<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other reviewers of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was set up in the army that monitors online content and prosecuted people who are accused of having slandered the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">"" "Thailand is committed to a strict commitment to" "" "Lese Majeste" "" "(majority offense)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, martial law was declared in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup d'etat.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems the Junta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive U-boats, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an internment store, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists are in jail, because they allegedly caused "confusion" in society and Internet users are threatened with long sentences when they insult the monarchy.</seg>

<seg id="1804">The post-war society recovered only very slowly in East Abchasia, especially in the district of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1805">It has now passed over 20 years since the Georgian-Abchashic war has been officially ended, but its scars are still very visible in this part of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of the northern district in Tkuarchal show striking pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages such as Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharchilava are located in the hydrocarbon pool of Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups, including Russians, Greeks, Asia, Georgian and Armenians, lived and worked in Soviet times in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, most of the Russians and Abchasen live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost towns in Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period, more than 10,000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people living in these ghostly cities.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the district amounted to 16,000 people, having barely risen over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989, about 43,000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants attempting to cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink brilline structure and gold-coloured earrings in teddy bears.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. yet they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a target for Africans and Haitians, who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2.50 dollars a night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom, there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian migrants are coming here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"" "sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez tells, come the people in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying:" "" "Mama Africa!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At present it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already welcomed 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already been sleeping outside on cartons.</seg>
<seg id="1912">It does not want to reject anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are ill, she buys them drugs that they cannot pay, she massaging them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Ms. Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1923">Sebastiao is travelling with his sister hoping to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children there.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is normal for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitians and the Africans often travel together and that Africans are already talking about Whatsapp of Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker for the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he started his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months. he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will be in contact with Ms. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "mother Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," "" "he answers, smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells her guests often send her text messages when they went to salute her or to tell her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the driving force of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have received migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on blankets on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"" "there are places where people help and others don't help. that's the reason why I give them my support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">Having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his workplace.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children, who wanted to squeeze money out of him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown person, a single person, offered it to him.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go the next step.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa, everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the aisles, the traveler calmly consult their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, most of them from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. Ramírez is happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandma she smooths her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair care, which she has made a lady, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users, in the first quarter of 1996</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of the city Urumqi received a cell phone notification in which they instruct the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaner").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message it is said that the app" "" "prevents access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the authorities have also been using the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because, shortly after they had installed the app, they exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the police announcement that the app would locate and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app for minors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these features can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate the home network of a person or steal from it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reports of digital censorship in China focus mostly on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the East and South, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and discontent in the areas of conflict, the authorities often submit far-reaching censors and surveillance measures, as well as routinely Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Twitter-based media outlet "Images from mainland China," which publishes censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where police checked the inhabitants indiscriminately if they had installed the monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure that people use the official jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification requested that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are discovered at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they might be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use equipment that is intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity through the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"" "" "" "images from mainland China" "" "(for the first time in the first quarter) also published a Jingwang product description, from which the software can lift up the password request of a Windows operating system, thereby ensuring unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer." ""</seg>
<seg id="1985">After Jingwang's installation, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council to minimize dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All branches of government, government and related institutions, including universities and research institutes, are obliged to follow the instructions of the cyber security office in the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Freedom House's current report, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of Urumqi regional capital to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" at the local police station on June 27.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." this action however violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and awards them penalties for a number of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2064">Punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls this affectionate confession.</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the cloak.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner will delight in your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him and you can't withhold your cries.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My screams weren't enough for him, so they exchanged the pipe through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">During my first arrest, I asked myself if the investigator had worked as a waste collector in the past or whether that belonged to the normal work equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They intertwined four cables to present us the great discovery of a huge cable from their point of view.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within a single hour three of them alternated while I was still in line.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I ceased to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The executioner noticed the cooling and did not take any pleasure in it, which is why he intervened next to an electrically charged stick.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Power flowed my whole body, enough to supply all my neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My half naked body lying on the ground was the perfect conductor.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was there again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours, he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">It must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">A few hours left, which came to me like minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"" "the door opens and the morning light fills the room." "" "Raus with you, Arschficker." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2085">"" "I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth:" "" "my Lord, my father has to worry." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2086">"" "" "" "be silent and keep you, you will be laid." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2087">That was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they had always left me free.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Where do they lead me?!</seg>
<seg id="2090">Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and opposition</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he slumbs to his screen, sometimes to his computer, and back to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips stained with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the topmost story of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaib's family to escape from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as felahyeen (such as Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who confronts the conservative majority and questioned their ancient opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with issues such as oriental alism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also calls out the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities ranging from Damascus to Syria through to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At the age of 25, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his mind, and he can feel according to his own statement with the people suffering from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not openly admit it, he has a special reluctance against U.S. foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, have anything to do with his identity as "Palestinian refugees of the second generation" - he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and never before in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think about my own circumstances so," "" "emphasizes Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so, because I am a person," "" "while he shakes Nescafé in water in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness in breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a scorching hot junta has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the lignum lukewarm coffee and the squadron of the Kent cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially if you look at the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan, to drink water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the Interior Ministry of Jordan said a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that sexual orientation of the homosexual frontssinger Hamed Sinno contradicts the country's cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert cancellation.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former press secretary of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahnerb said in an interview with CNN that the concert was "just" cancelled because of the singer's sexual orientation.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which questioned the established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila appreciated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to advocate for intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement might not be simply shallow rhetoric, but in fact reflect an increasingly clear crystallizing reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaib's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib regressed traditional gender men by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have marital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a clearly laid-down woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they really should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"" "in recent years, the number of" "" "honour killings" "" "has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside." ""</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honour killings reached its peak in 2016; however, it is further aggravated that Jordan lacks institutional infrastructure to support the women who attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a 1954 law on crime against crime, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can "be held indefinitely in prison" and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditures as well as the guarantee from the family that the woman will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaib's music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues that have long been considered taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "politics has been" "" "fed in" "", "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">"" "in a song called" "" "Edward Sa'ed" "", "Hdaib is attacking the question of the Palestinian identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb," the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs, which are political at the core, can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song one verse often repeats:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you, in his words, "can get what you want" - be it faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbian and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals were strongly censored by 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, to find out later that his comments were torn apart, twisted and in his opinion censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, streamed but only a edited version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is campaigning openly for the Arabic LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not talk about Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nueva, a poet of the eighth century, who is still remembered today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nui, who was supposed to work on behalf of the caliph later, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemite kingdom it is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service established several former members of the government and members of the teacher association, with the reasoning that they have critically commented on comments in social media that are related to corruption-rooted corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaib's opinion is just the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now resisted Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that's how Hdaib - is made up of slow, thoughtful and inner changes. he is sure that these changes take place every day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without interventions abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of" "" "experiencing it" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be approached by music, art and literature on a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificially induced democracies. at least he hopes this.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time comes, Hdaib will move on and also resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman was a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festivals.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is assumed that it is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually celebrated in many areas of Tohokus in August. another theory states that the armored cars, the drums and dancing were handed down over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies from west Japan marched into the north-east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">It is hard to imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking forward to the meguro Gajoen for a long time: two anchorages are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">However, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend your summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer Festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of an 18-meter-high carriage was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let's enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely external appearances and body care were as important as in this story, because they help keep the Peruvian youth away from criminality and promote a legitimate profession like the one of the barber.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the Pacific Ocean, close to Lima's historic center - a region with a very high crime rate where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to the fact that more and more regular citizens go into the seasoned hands of hairdressers who can recreate these expensive hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hair styles that go to the most extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the barber's "Batalla de Barberos" competition, which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There experts are competing against each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks as you can see in the next video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as Augusto Salazar Bondy who are located in El Callao found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressers and to receive training in hairdressers instead of bad advice, which enables them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and offering opportunities, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently fashionable.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only specialist school in the community and the district where we are very proud, because we have built this educational community out of love for the children.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the contribution" "" "Love messages to guerilla fighters" "", "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we just write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel expelled?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is exactly what prompted the young Colombian activist Leonardo Párraga from the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired her to the campaign Cartas por la (Letters for Reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government closed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), forming the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the peace treaty was considered to be so significant that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But before Colombians there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years and have been exposed to war rhetoric and carried their arms around the clock must now re-integrate into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred against guerrilla fighters, must now take in its ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would have to join together and help in the process of integration.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: up to now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerilla fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly to Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day but forget those who need them much more needless.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He was planning to share his love with people that needed the most urgent appeal this year.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former FARC fighters who now need to find their place in society and build a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace," she says.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were delivered on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the region of Caldono-Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo of the BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp to personally pass the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC have set themselves up as they had done before to accept the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of protection from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," explained the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I looked into one of the "Cambusches" (a kind of hut where the guerrilla fighters were living) I saw a guerilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because next to him on the bed was a MGL-garnet, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I still spoke to him and asked," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he said," "" "I answer a letter someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "" "" "never before in my life someone wrote me something so beautiful, so I answer it." "" "suddenly the tears run over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him very tightly and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of the war, was sorry to be the faithful companion of this struggle all the years, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life as a war. to join the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the start, students and some leaders of the FARC came together for a discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up when there was war and the FARC had already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC have declared the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process. "for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the State affects the whole Colombian people. now that we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help shape society more just in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a purpose of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "" "one of them said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing these people who had never heard of hearing and had no right to vote, and realizing that people, whom I often saw and hated as a monster, were also only people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and so much damage done, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the camp commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">Colombians were prophesied that peace would reign after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, famine and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to take arms, rise and protest for their rights. and that is fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and sacrifice, for we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence, will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2243">Homosexuals and queer people living in the Caucasus region face a wide range of dangers - including discrimination, physical and sexual violence and blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="2244">With terror activists have witnessed the coverage of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat that hangs over the LGBTQ community on the LGBTQ community did not come into being only overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grosny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has captured the international headlines several months ago after reports have been published that address the spread, torture and killing of queer men in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milashina in the Nowaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who arrested her suspicious queer men and put her in secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a trans woman, was born in Grozny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Since her childhood she felt she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she grew up she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, and why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After having experienced a group of Tschetschenen from the sex balance of their landlady, the hunt was opened on Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">For fear of her life, she finally moved to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer for a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">As I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he was a friend, a copy of my documents and spread her everywhere on the Internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no men in Chechnya who can remove that shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that the photos of my documents made the rounds through WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">I was attacked on 10 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was there to fetch a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying: "here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "" "how long do you want to honor the family, you stain?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I just know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up at the hospital in the end.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had got everything and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which wings were you placed - in the men or women of the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for having dealt with me with respect.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February, I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote to me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They asked me, I must prove it by going through the streets above; others wanted me to appear on official TV in Grosny saying that I didn't change my gender, that everything was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "You brought a monster to the world that shook not only your family, but the whole republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">It was too much for my mother and she laid a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time, I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later a car with a dark window panes and a license plate with a 95 on it stood under the window.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it had happened for the third time, it became clear to me that something was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked out the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you escape?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I still can't understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before I left Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registering, without identification, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"" "in the moment I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I received a message:" "" "you don't believe, you're safe, just because you left the country?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "just to prove it to you: it's the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still get in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about the gender balance, this is a taboo subject.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this psychological barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I really try to look at the person she recalls from her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who are dormant?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him, I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who has been in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He said that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that everyone could hardly wait for the end of Ramadan, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"" "I mean, they probably invite the relatives, these care about the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand proof that the so-called" "" "honour" "" "experienced by blood gratification." ""</seg>
<seg id="2329">"" "" "" "OC media: are gay men still being held in these secret prisons?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says that there are not so many people.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"" "" "" "if, then, especially those who have no rich relations or who have been dropped by their relatives to face Kadyrows" "" "court." ""</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "If they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and say they have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, they were deliberately immersed in order to become radicalised.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC media: is that just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown beard.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now they have not been presented as bandits, but there have been no reports so far. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else wouldn't we have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already occurred in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think before 2003 I was already known all over Grozny when I lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">Seriously!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was applied, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">In the end, Russia wanted to bring us back to the "civilization," but in the end it has thrown us back into the Stone Age.</seg>
<seg id="2352">"" "" "" "OC media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were slipped; I had tinted eyelashes, wore tube jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of security of Sharia never even hurt me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian Theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a phrase: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "don't worry about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to be children when they laugh at the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC media: so they just closed their eyes in front of you because they thought you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov came up with the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began to speak about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He didn't talk about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Still, you could feel how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who laughed and laughed at first looked at you once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time, I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I returned home I could sense how the situation in the republic deteriorated steadily.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity are you going to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organise teetreels, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't pay any penny for that.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I apprehended attributions.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidroab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">This is how nature is, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chetschenen, who want to make you white with foam in front of your mouth that there are no gays with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">"" "the Dagestaner, who have the cabarins, who, the Russians also have, on the whole planet they exist - but" "" "not in Chechnya" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">Here I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think of transitions to men who love men and they believe that you change your sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of feeling to be precise, different attitudes of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to feel ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last few months there has been a strong increase in suicides.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is characterized by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, inability to pay for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who would like to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had lighted himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to erase the flames, and Moramazi was brought to Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors couldn't do anything anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab ich Tamim - have appealed.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family-patrons, who were helpless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution by the Iranian government, to feed their families and to pursue a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which most of the Arab Ahwazi-based Arab communities living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the domestic Arab population to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and in 1925 undertook great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable usable areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop only slowly, and the local population is getting little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and privations.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime is denying the Ahwazi-Arabs systematically in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a large number of dams, the water from the Arab areas to the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to aggravating the devastation caused in the region, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among Arab ahawzi adolescents has now increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director General for Cooperative, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis who are looking for a job have completed primary school, 55% finished school, and 45% have completed a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"" "a" "" "systematic strategy" ""... "aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist with a resident in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" of the number of suicide among young Ahwazi-men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians in Ahwaz and anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since functionaries and institutions prefer non-Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home country of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affiliation with the Ahwazi and to be questioned, as even Arab names wouldn't be tolerated at the workplace, let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances surrounding the Arab Ahwazi, human rights activists strike alert before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world will wake up and take note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is avoidable.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the website of Afroféminas. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I'm not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even lay well-conceived scientific and social arguments in front of me, why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminists * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, despite equal education, women still earn less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come to a glass ceiling sooner or later, and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still going through the many different countries and denominations.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is well-known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that I suffer twice and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I come to talk about skin color, on black women, on black women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused under racism and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">"" "however, all agree that women - all women - should come together to" "" "lift up their voices and sing" "" "Kumbaya, my Lord" "" "to achieve equal rights (some) of the women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about the fact that there is an institutionalised form of racist violence in addition to sexualised violence, which we are exposed to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnic groups and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background often refer to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"" "" "" "or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men, and all men of all skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, I cannot join a movement as a black woman, in whose centre the white woman stands who refuses to consider injustice in her mind, which refers to both sex and skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">"" "" "" "I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging to a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women over and over again." ""</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "Sojourner complained in her speech in 1851:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to uphold an ideology in which the black woman is in historical respect a demented and marginalized being." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups who also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation in order to advance their egocentric agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlap of skin color and gender. some of them will continue to keep silent about the importance of black women for the feminist movement no matter how many black women try to reward them for a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and isolate themselves from white feminism, the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself fully and completely from feminism and to join the movement of the Womanism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than using me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before that we define black women for our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: Reclaiming "(about: Africa-Womanism: how we recapture ourselves) speaks of the fact that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can in this way also create spaces where they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements that make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform themselves about hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures, for in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my being as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life is neither bypassed nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abridged and edited version of the article "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay" by cursor. the article is part of the series # PorSerMujer, which reports about violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the persons affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner told Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had become violent towards her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship, some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman showed Balbuena due to mistreatment, Ada Báez's informed announcement was of no avail.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman withdrew her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In general, women do not receive any support from the State when they report an advert at all.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence should contact the law enforcement authorities at all.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content 1 Strips and statistics 2 invisible mistreatment and a legal system that nothing undermine 3 Paraguays laws: good approach, inadequate implementation hits and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is difficult to determine how many women are truly mistreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social science research institution in Paraguay. "there are various data and reports that do not even show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the available numbers are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, 9600 District Attorney filed an ad due to domestic violence. at 70% of them, there was violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of police officers came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were over 5000 advertisements due to domestic violence in the peace courts. 86% of women's adverts came here as well.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the advertisements, 40% of women said that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of mental ill-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics, however, do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan women's minister, Ana Baiardi, few of these crimes are actually shown. "on every woman who is refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do so will come.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want it, but gave up. this should always be regrettable.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer associated with Carlos. but for two years she endured psychological violence in his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most apparent:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would become victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that only women who are too submissive because they let themselves be deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his insults and assorted various attacks during her two-year relationship, and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their posts, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen for so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of mistreatment had at least some complicity in it.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture taken with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not mentioned at all. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site: there are many medicines and vaccines that are lacking in the global healthcare system, which cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more grave consequences in the poorest countries than elsewhere, and lack of investment in researching these diseases by drug companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, the research carried out by African scientists is helping build their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Center for Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">In the 1990s he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, especially when the AIDS epidemic had a serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a Postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before deciding to go back home to support the Sámi Healthcare System.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GM): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Sámi national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I have just launched a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GM: what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always be receiving addressees instead of being a mover.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently well.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, as funding and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, space exploration, health care (non-communicable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GM: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that pose challenges.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines can only be used against payment (the so-called "paywall") also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how open-source seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 different varieties, such as Outshrout, the first plant grown and eaten by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited by his own ingenuity and the question of how many types of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents were not only applied to individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, special red or green or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the last few years, more and more such patents have been filed for more and more plants such as grain or carrots. based on these trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">Morton still breeds salad as a passionate exponent of a millennia of old tradition, but it takes longer since his work is increasingly complicated by more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it's as if there's a boulder in a river for which I have to dumpy." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do this now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think these patents go too far on salads.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, no one can breed any new type of salad, because all the characteristics are already patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and endeavours not to use any material protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined forces in the United States and around the world: open Source Breeding (Open Source Breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts from the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red Römersalat of the variety Outshofen in the "glasshouse" of the station and ate. there it is tested, whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT field and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for Open Source seeds) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It has been established to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders are bound to commit themselves to free use of the seeds they have bred.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others who buy their seeds, cross it to breed their own varieties, and not immediately sow - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Grim prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg are in control of seed and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">As a result, seed plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg points out that the "open-source" movement does not occupy itself with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over seeds," he says. "whoever wants to buy good, locally and sustainably produced vegetables, should also know that the way this vegetables are bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without a seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to continuing to provide their seeds free of charge, as opposed to patent seed and plant traits.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is threatened because the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasingly abundant intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always available.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of the Ossi, has engaged in her PhD thesis with a genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all carrot characteristics are protected as intellectual property, which makes it difficult for plant breeders either not or only difficult to use.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There are no such estimates for other plants yet, but experts such as Luby suggest that mass-grown plants like wheat are patented in an even bigger style than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Matter of Viewing</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown in such a way that they have specifically desired traits - from those through which their taste or colour improves to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing due to more and more patents. genetic diversity is more necessary at present than ever since changing conditions are much worse due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto tells Carly Scaduto that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions like the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts the notion that intellectual property is limited to other breeders because" "" "patents and protection of plant-diversified products promote innovation." "" "a patent is basically a plan everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "such protection thus prevents innovation, but encourages them by providing more material and expertise to the public." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: wait 20 years until a patent expires, certainly not foster innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">"" "however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain:" "" "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us." ""</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us forward and it will be impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "in total, Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant traits:" "" "we don't really create the characteristics themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form it themselves and as a breeder we have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">"" "a mystery of nature." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeders in the US state of Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "whoever breeds a variety breeds his own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation it needs masses of herbicides, culminates in its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is just opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such as are active in international markets, but smaller than Monsanto) have patents, most of the smaller seed companies manage to survive even without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton also believes that breeders by avoiding plant patents would be more innovative: "it looks like I'm using my efforts to produce something new, stronger than a company that patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">"" "I constantly need new material for my catalogue, as I know that my rivals will sell my grades in a few years," "" "he says." "" "with a patent, you are protected from competition for 20 years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be a leader in open-source breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly across the globe.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (Centre for Sustainable Agriculture), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, is launching an open-source seed programme.</seg>
<seg id="2685">"" "it also supports them to come to" "" "open source" "" "seeds and sell their own." ""</seg>
<seg id="2686">"" "the German organization Agrecol is working on an" "" "open source" "" "license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding differ from country to country, therefore the Ossi obligation cannot be simply taken one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the Executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patented. thus, it opposes the current practice of the European Patent Office which allows patents on conventionally bred plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016 the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia, where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to learn something about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend to patenting seeds.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organization and blog are the latest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of August 5, the Egyptian government locked up the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANTRUI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports about the same.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the Network published a statement on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities sharply criticized for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information persists in spite of this attack and the ridiculing of the Egyptian right and the constitution by the authorities who are supposed to defend the law of freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world. even though it has never been so difficult to continue to pursue these goals, it has never been as important as now. ANHRI proves that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the blockade and not give in. we insist on fulfilling our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent Mada Masr news site, the Arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and Al Jazeera's network of alleged "support for terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of wave of webside barriers to victims. @ anhri one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to the ANHRI, the blog of columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt any more.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for the dissemination of columns and articles he writes for Egypt's non-accessible web pages and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he set up to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government, became the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider with which Canada's blog is located, on the other hand, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while reporting about the student protests and taking a video on how police exercise physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles focus mainly on politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada voiced the government's closure and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even though the blogging of the blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) They have managed to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege; A arrest, a tried murder, summons to the National Security Council, the locking of blogs as well as any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They have proven that I did not write for nothing. in other words, my words have influence, albeit only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post items to bypass the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now, however, after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities blocked out websites from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites. these resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">In addition, afte documented the blockade of providers possible through the bypassing of Internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">She reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how to block websites offering VPNs.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering content that Egyptian users could have access to.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation is worsened by the fact that decisions are made behind closed doors, so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis to act against such acts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship, and whom will it attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers in Brazil with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the country's second largest city and home of numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year-old in school shot," "" "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered," "" "Thieves smoked chemist with military weapons," "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, marine and airwaves to Rio." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the 2017 violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian NGO Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "this is how the newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "published for detailed coverage of violence in Rio on 16 August published the editorial saying" "" "It is not normal" "" "in which they announced to set up a new section called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper explains the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. all that happens from civilized standard and what is happening in Rio will be published in the category "War in Rio." (...) This is our way of crying: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, so that as journalists we don't close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war rubrik in a country that doesn't recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a newspaper writes that according to the Institute for Inner Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 domains controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to disguise the atrocities of the police who first shoot and then ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">"" "does the term" "" "war" "" "harm more than it uses?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the Intercept Brasil news portal, the journalist Cecília Oliveira, on the other hand, argues that violence as a "war." this is, in its opinion, a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold accountability in the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated Extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2779">"" "if we look at the murders per state, Rio is ranked 16th," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">In addition to the company Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, as Cecília emphasises, has been repeating the state's security policy for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security policy measures included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to capture a favela by deploying a massive police custody and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this indeed led to a decline in violent deaths. for several years, however, after several reports on shamans and repressions against poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit, the UPP was increasingly under fire.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles in 2010, explaining why the violence in Rio does not meet the criteria specified by the Geneva Conventions for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also entails grave consequences for the people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this demands the state to use means and means which are typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of an "enemy," in which a civilian is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes the object of "collateral damage" and "lost bullets."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, the fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week ago, the police caught up the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: a salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Worldwatch, a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The East Ghouta region is particularly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21, 2013 called for hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition go on the basis of UN investigations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas have been under siege in Damascus, leading to the fact that inhabitants are dependent on locally produced or smuggled goods through tunnels and checkpoints.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academics will teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas to plant their own mushrooms as a "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and conduct the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms are not part of the traditional food planted in Syria and are only extremely rare in Syrian cuisine. however, their foodstuff makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">Head of the project, Abo Nabil, said:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">"" "Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed its relief that it now gains more and more" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2814">To collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghira Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to pass 125 families knowledge to grow mushrooms, according to Dr. Leila, Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the constitution of this article, they have reached more than 100% of their expected target of around €12.700, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo until Monday, 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortage, locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they began with" "" "production from the regions descendant" "" "before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>
<seg id="2820">Then they planted a small mushroom-yard in a tub. when this succeeded, they used a larger tub. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">"" "now they have designed a" "" "educational farm for the region" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed mushrooms throughout East Ghouta for free.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many district capitals in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 dead.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire breaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy happened in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured in the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors forest areas via satellite imagery, some 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal by 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire in four districts.</seg>

<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus drew attention to the fact that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of easily combustible wood, spread, like in a vicious circle, after fires of this kind more and more.</seg>
<seg id="2855">These problems add to the fact that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15 and 16, when inhabitants sought information or attempted to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: they used their own civil protection data using the application fove.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so critical in this fateful weekend in October that the servers didn't stand up to the onslaught of 400,000 users who persecuted the fires: the site counted more than half a million hits.</seg>

<seg id="2874">Two years before, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groupings that had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair.</seg>

<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "it was really tough," "" "Ashark recalled in an interview with Global Voices." "" "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, on which we also worked." ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no service there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we don't freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Ashark left his life without papers in Iran and was ready to travel to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small uninhabited island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his application for asylum, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">For some time Ashara was homeless, running alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid needy two times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high double rates. it is true, however, that the conditions for asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "the human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the large majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres" "". "these are improvised institutions in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially submitted an application for asylum - which can be passed for months after the application of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then people who have no money for accommodation, either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was Ashark.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his incompetent lifespan helped Asharpen to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of working in the construction industry, Ashark put all his savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis success story is now a topic of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film won the Venice City Award in 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for employers in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Lots of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some Afghans run companies, including tailor shops, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">But Ashara's goals reach far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail and aim back to the country that he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where there is a risk, there are also opportunities," "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily, if I know that my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as all others." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">Ashark also greets plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques. "so they can sell their crop shots on the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development to a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end there is stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Ashark himself made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacy's Netizen report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">"" "" "" "the Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that foresees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government agency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users need to register in order to use social networks within six months of submitting the law decision on the authority's website stating their full name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "those who neglect this step could be sentenced to six months" "" "imprisonment or tribunals of a penalty payment." ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was applied by sixty Parliamentary members, is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "in May another MP filed a draft legislative proposal in which severe penalties for the insult of the president or high officials would be introduced." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">"" "" "" "under the rule of law, such action would, however, be punishable by prison sentences and fines, such as the legal experts of the" "" "Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this can be up to three years in prison for the convicted.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan), arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup led by the elected President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan waited, like more than 700 participants, who had been arrested in the same incident, four years in prison for a trial date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">His trial was recently postponed to 20 May because the prison administration, according to human rights groups, failed to bring the defendants from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatens the death penalty because of one, so many human rights groups agree, apparent burden of e.g. weapons possession, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a Criminal Court in Giza acquitted the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their reporting on pro-Morsi sitting blockade on Raba'a Al-Adawiya Square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the punishments of journalists Abdullah al-Fakarany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous case, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Listen to Tunisian activists to leaked documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was chiefly interrogated to a resettled action plan. said plan comes from the President of the Republic, which, according to the plan, explicitly supports a controversial draft bill that would guarantee businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of the corruption accused of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2949">This document, published on 21 April on the Nawaat website, sheds light on how the presidential plans to support the legal state look like.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia rejected the mention of his sources under Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which assures journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he joined the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the case.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Will China want to force the users of social media to show their identification?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new rules of the Information Offices of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In the rules it is also stated that the registration with the full name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts believe that this will allow the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks. it is unclear until now how the authorities will apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these regulations only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">"" "do we then see ourselves in" "" "WeChat" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging App WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Roskomnadzor, WeChat hesitated to register as an" "" "organiser of the information distribution" "" "in the state government." ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a law from 2014, thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organize the "publication of information." the law also allows the government to provide said services for the removal of content and force it upon request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites currently include websites such as Vkontakte and Odnogorniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the e-mail service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
