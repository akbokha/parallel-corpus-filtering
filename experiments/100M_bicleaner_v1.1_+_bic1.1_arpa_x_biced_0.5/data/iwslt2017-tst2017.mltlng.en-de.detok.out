This is James Risen.
They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.
Long before someone had heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA had illegally heard phones of Americans.
But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.
In this he describes a disastrous U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA surrendered to Iran literally drafts for a nuclear bomb.
If that sounds crazy, read it.
It's an incredible story.
But do you know who didn't like the chapter?
The U.S. government.
For almost 10 years, the government has investigated risks and called upon him to call his alleged sources.
In this turn, he became a symbol for the pattern of the government to condemn whistleblower and spy on journalists.
According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.
But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the needy who reveal it.
So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many brave reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison.
From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison.
But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.
"" "" "" "suddenly, although they have been saying for years that it would be essential for their case, the government's demands were dropped." ""
The reason: in the era of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can always hide less and less.
Instead of shutting and splitting up, it could also do his digital Footprints for him.
And so the investigators, without his consent, hid his telephone references secretly,
Just like his e-mail data, financial and bank information, his return, and even travel tips with the list of his flights.
In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and risens supposed source.
Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.
President Obama promised to protect whistleblower, but instead, the judiciary condemned more than all US governments in front of him.
Now you can imagine how this can be a problem especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret.
Since September 11, almost every article about national security has been the result of a whistleblower going to a journalist.
So we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first Constituent Assembly because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on all.
But just as technology allows the government to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can use technologies to better protect their sources.
They can do that from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand.
Today, there are communication software that didn't exist when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.
Such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblowers, originally developed by the internet site of Aaron's Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, in which I work.
Instead of sending an email, go to a news website, like the here of the Washington Post.
There you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form.
These are then encrypted and stored on a server where only the relevant news agency has access.
So the government cannot obtain more information secretly, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset.
SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.
Unfortunately governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that endanger all of us.
"" "" "" "it is important to ensure that not only technological men such as Edward Snowden have a chance to get rid of misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower," ""
Or a Wall Street insider, who warns us of the next financial crisis, warns about abuses in the supply of soldiers. or the nearest environment agent who alerts alert to the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wall Street insider who warns us of the next financial crisis.
"" "" "" "after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights." ""
Thank you.
[on April 3, 2016 the biggest data leck of history has been published.] [the Panama Papers reveal that rich and mighty] [We have been asking Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] This week we were asked about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca
The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.
We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?"
We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.
This has led to very direct consequences.
Iceland's Prime Minister has resigned.
There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has letterbox offices in tax havens.
It is alleged that a track of $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.
Now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others waiting nervously for the next release, and on the next disclosed documents.
Now it sounds like the Plot of an agent or a John Grisham novel.
It seems crying away from you, me, ordinary people.
Why should this happen to us?
But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.
And that concerns us all.
For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.
All over the world media and leading politicians, like secret tax havens, are used by a few to hide and obscure their fortunes -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.
I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.
I always imagine a Matryoschkapuppe.
So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these illicit.
It can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters.
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.
Presumably because there have so far been no prominent Americans who came forward in these revelations, this scandal.
Now it's not that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax havens.
But due to the principle that these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American customers.
If we had a data leck from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US.
In fact, in some US states you need less information, you need to provide less information to create a company than to obtain a library card.
This kind of intransparency in the US allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.
Fraudsters have allowed scammers to rip off particularly vulnerable jetties.
It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.
Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks like.
How does this work?
So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 bar firms in Manhattan.
Our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.
We really shocked the fact that all except one lawyer made proposals to our investigators how he could transfer his money.
None of these lawyers approached us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anyone. but it shows the problem with this system.
It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.
It is not a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covert investigators.
"" "" "" "it's not about a single top politician, involved in a scandal." ""
It is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.
And in order to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game.
We have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult.
This may sound very dull as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing had ever changed, as if there will always be the rich and powerful.
But as a born optimist, I see quite a lot of things started to change.
"" "" "" "over the past few years we have seen more transparency as far as the owners of companies are concerned." ""
The issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.
"" "" "" "since then, the EU has been collecting key governance at a national level, who really is behind firms in Europe and who controls them." ""
One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA hinders here.
Representatives of both parties have tabled a bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see.
We would really like to see this Panama-Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally.
For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.
We need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headlamps.
"" "we need leaders in the economy to get up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""
"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this kind of intransparency by laws." ""
"" "" "" "together we can finally end the intransparency that is now enabling this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""
This is the story I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.
One day after I finished my design studies, I made a sale of the farm.
A guy in the red Mazda stayed standing and looked at my belongings.
He bought one of my works of art.
He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip across the country. after that he would go to the Peace corps.
I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.
It was late. I got tired.
"" "as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where are you sleeping tonight?" "" "" ""
"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""
And I thought, "Oh, man!
What am I doing now? "
Who doesn't know the situation?
Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?
But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the Peace Corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to get kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazda!
This is a small luggage compartment!
"" "then I heard me say," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""
"" "one voice in my head said," "" "uh, please?" "" "" ""
"" "at night I lay in bed, I gazed at the ceiling and thought," "" "Oh man! what did I get in there?" ""
A wild stranger sleeps in my living room.
"" "what if he's crazy?" "" "" ""
I got such a fear that I got out of bed, sneezing on toe tips to the door, and shut my bedroom door.
But he was not crazy at all.
We are still in contact.
The work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.
That was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my point of view.
Maybe the people who were sold to me when I was a stranger were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?
To accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress with.
Let's take a leap, two years later...
I'm unemployed, almost bankrupt, my roommate is pulling out and the rent is increased.
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.
I think creativity can create it, transform fear into fun.
I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could earn something. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, plus a mattress and every morning breakfast.
Ha! "
We created a website and founded so "air mattresses and breakfast" [AIRB and Breakfast = Airbnb].
Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on the wooden floor.
They found it super, and we too.
I'm sure our cheese ham omelettes tasted completely different because we made it for our guests.
We toured all the city with them. when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I started.
Had we just discovered that at the same time we were able to find new friends and pay our rent?
Things were rolling.
My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.
We wanted to find out if this could be a business concept.
So we presented to investors: "we want to create a website where people publish publicly pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors are closed when visitors come by.
Through the internet, they can then invite other people to stay with them.
That will be the next big thing! "
We waited for the rocket to ignite.
But they do not act.
No one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people.
Why?
Because we all learned that foreigners are dangerous.
If one has a problem, one observes the things that one can do well. we were able to design.
At the Academy of Art, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it's the overall experience.
We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.
Can design make such a thing?
Is it possible to create trust with design?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we were striving for.
It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.
Thumbs up when you are ready.
Take your mobile phone into your hands.
Now I'd like you to unlock your mobile phone.
Give your unlocked mobile phone to your left sitting-neighbour.
This silent flight of panic that you are now feeling -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.
The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.
Visitors can't only read your SMS, they can see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.
How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?
Most people feel the responsibility.
This is how most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.
Only for this reason can our company exist.
Just so, who's actually Al Gores's mobile phone?
Could you please announce on Twitter that he is candidate for the Office of the President?
You can now return the cell phones.
You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up. I want to tell you about some of the discoveries.
What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?
What if your neighbor had first imagined his name; if he had told where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?
Imagine that you would have 150 assessments, all of which say, "He can really get hold of very well-designed cell phones!"
How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?
A well thought-out feedback system significantly strengthens trust.
In the beginning we made some things wrong.
It was difficult for people to leave negative judgements.
Finally, we decided to wait until both host and guest left their assessments before we set them online.
Last week we discovered something new.
We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are regarding age and place of residence.
Not surprisingly we trust people most, who are most similar to us.
The more differences we find, the less we trust.
This is a natural social bias.
It will be exciting if you add a person's call -- in our case by judgements.
If you have fewer than three assessments, nothing changes.
But if you have more than ten, everything changes.
"" "" "" "a good reputation is common." ""
The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.
We also learned that trust is dependent on how much money is available.
Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.
"" "if you tell too little how, for example," "" "Hi!" "" "you won't get an answer." ""
"" "if you tell too much, for example," "" "I have problems with my mother -- -- the request isn't accepted either." ""
So there is an optimal degree of openness, such as "Great works of art in your apartment! I'm making holidays with my family."
How can you create it with design to create this degree of openness?
We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on how to write something.
Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.
What we didn't reckon was the great amount of people who were more than willing to put down these prejudices.
Here you see how many people claim our offer.
Three things can be recognized.
First: incredibly good luck.
Second, the tireless work of our team.
Thirdly, a need which had not been covered before.
Business is very good for us.
Of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly.
There were guests who have been partying unallowed parties or have ravaged apartments.
Hosts have left guests in the rain.
At the beginning of the project I worked with customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.
I stood on the front line when confidence was broken.
There is nothing worse than those calls. it hurts when I only think about it.
The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.
Fortunately, only a fraction of 123 million overnight stays had a problem.
For people are in accordance with each other rightly.
If trust works, something wonderful can emerge.
One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.
His host drove him to the hospital.
He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!
Here is his assessment:
"perfect house for travelers who tend to have heart attacks because of sedentary activities.
The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.
Javier and Alejandra are true guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know one.
You drive one in your own car to the hospital if you die and wait while you get a bypass.
Because they don't want people to feel lonely they pass books.
They can stay longer without charge of extra nights.
I can only recommend it! "
Of course not every stay runs off.
But these relationships behind the pure monetary transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy.
When I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:
How does the idea of sharing with money transactions work together?
It is a matter of economic trade.
"" "but now it is simply" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing is not fair." ""
"" "" "" "share Economy" "" "describes a trade which promises human relationships." ""
People place a part of themselves openly, and that changes everything.
When you travel today, it is easy to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.
But what if trips were a rich buffet made of local impressions?
What if at every place one visits, a group of residents would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one in a pub-turpentine neighborhood of which one has never heard of;
Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?
Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.
What if we would design apartments from the ground up to each other?
What would that look like?
What if cities would accept the idea of sharing one's share?
I imagine cities that enable us society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.
This project has already begun in South Korea's capital Seoul. many parking spaces owned by the government have already begun.
Have been offered to residents. students who were looking for a lead,
Were taught to people whose children were educated, and incubate programmes were launched,
To finance new start-ups in the Share economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host.
So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.
We didn't reinvent the wheel.
There was also a warm hospitality before.
There have been similar websites in front of us.
So why exactly did our work work?
Apart from luck and timing we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust.
Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.
I think that's amazing,
Almost overwhelming.
I have to think about it every time a red Mazda drives past me.
We know, of course, that design can't solve any problem.
But if it could help us, if it had this big impact, I wonder what we can use in the near future.
Thank you.
What do you think if you look at me?
A believer? an expert?
Maybe even a sister.
Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?
Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.
This is indeed true.
I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions.
So the media represent people who look like me.
One study found that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.
Studies show that the Americans think that most would not know Muslims.
Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.
For those who have never met a Muslim, it's great to get to know you.
I tell you who I am.
I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.
I am introverted,
A wannabe fitness fanatics,
And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.
But not as Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I wasn't born like that.
"" "" "" "I have decided to do so." ""
When I was 17, I decided to ouch myself.
No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear my head cover.
"" "my feminist friendships were horrified:" "" "why do you suppress yourself?" "" "" ""
The funny thing was: back then it was a feminist declaration of independence, in contrast to the pressure that I felt as a 17 year old, to adapt to a perfect and inaccessible beauty ideal.
I have not only adopted the faith of my parents passively.
I have struggled with the Qur'an.
I read it, thought, questioned, doubted, and ultimately believed.
My relationship with God was not love at first sight.
It was trust and slow devotion that deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.
The beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.
I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.
Have you ever had the feeling that somebody is perceiving you, you fully understand, and yet somehow loves you?
That's how it feels.
Later I got married and started, like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.
"" "later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the" "" "Egyptian-American Dream." "" "" ""
Then that terrible morning came in September 2001.
Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.
I was sitting in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word "breaking news."
There was smoke, planes flying in buildings, people jumped from the buildings.
What was that?
An accident?
A technical malfunction?
My shock quickly turned into rebellion.
Why should we do something like that?
"" "I switched to the television channel and heard" ""... "Muslim terrorists..." ""... "in the name of Islam..." ""... "Middle Eastern origin..." ""... "Jihad..." ""... "bombed Mecca!" "" "" ""
Oh my God.
Not only my country was attacked, but in the Nu the actions of others were transformed by a citizen into a suspicious person.
On the same day, we had to drive through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start postgraduate studies.
I remember how I was going to be silent -- as deep as I went into my seat, and I was the first time I was known to be recognized as Muslim.
We moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.
"" "and then I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said:" "" "be watchful" "", "" "" "Be careful," "" "" "" "
I stayed inside the whole week.
Then it became Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray.
"" "and again the warnings came:" "" "don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal." "" "" ""
I saw the extensive reporting.
Understandably, the feelings were unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims, or by people who were considered Muslims to be free and struck.
There were really fire attacks on mosques.
I thought we should stay at home.
But something did not feel right.
Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.
"" "" "" "I have put the anger of the people on the terrorists." ""
Imagine! I was also angry.
It is not easy to constantly explain itself.
I have nothing against questions, I love questions.
It is the accusations that are hard.
"" "nowadays we can actually hear people say," "" "There is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims." ""
When will we get rid of it? "
Some people want to banish Muslims and make mosques.
They speak of my church like a tumor in the US body.
It is just the question: are we malignant or benign?
You know that a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only observed under observation.
The alternatives are meaningless, because the question is wrong.
Like all the other Americans, Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ.
Thank you!
Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympians.
Will the closure of mosques make America more secure?
There may be a few parking spaces, but not stopping the terror.
Regular visits to a mosque leads to a more tolerant approach to people of other faiths, and to show greater civic participation.
And as I told me a leader of the police in the Washington DC area, DC recently told me: people are actually not being radicalised in mosques.
They are radicalized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.
In the process of radicalisation it has been found that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their church, even from their family, so that the extremist group may have a brainwashing which causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or disliked by faith.
If we want to prevent radicalization, we have to stop people going to the mosque.
Some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion.
Finally, a group like the IS bases its brutality with the Koran.
As a Muslim, as a mother, I think we need to do everything to stop a group like the IS.
But we would fit into their imaginations by recognising them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.
Thank you!
The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.
Both groups claim their ideology based on their "holy book."
"" "but when you look at them, they don't do what they read in their" "" "Holy Scriptures." "" "" ""
It is their brutality that lets them read these things into the scriptures.
An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:
A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.
He said the problem was just the opposite. every minister with whom she spoke, she silenced and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.
Inspired by nothing, and something that would have made sense to her anger, she was a main target for the instrumentalization of extremists who promised her a solution.
This Imam re-established the connection with God and its church.
Instead of accusing her for her anger, he showed her constructive ways of real change in the world.
What she learned in the mosque was to join the IS.
This was an insight into how the Islamophobia affects me and my family.
But how does it affect ordinary Americans?
How does it affect everyone else?
How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?
One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear we pass at least three things.
We rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudice.
One study reveals that when people submit messages that have been reported negatively about Muslims, they are more likely to have military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.
This is not just an academic problem.
If you are looking at the time when the Muslims' mood shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.
It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.
So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I have expected.
"" "" "" "it can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to undermine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens." ""
Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.
Perhaps we feel it first, but the toxic air of fear harms us all.
When assigning collective guilt it is not just about self-explaining.
Deah and his wife Yusor were a young couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school.
Deah was a sportsman.
He was talented, talented, promising...
His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.
She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:
"" "" "" "when is such an accomplished young man from my brother?" "" "" ""
Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting in the afternoon.
He shot Deah eight times.
Fanaticism may not only be immoral, but also deadly.
So back to the beginning.
What happened after the 9 / 11?
Did we go to the mosque or were we safe at home?
We discussed it and it was not an easy decision for us, because it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion.
We chose the mosque.
With our son in the children's seat, we drove through silence, with high pressure to the mosque.
I took him out, pulled out my shoes, went to the prayer hall, and what I saw let me pause.
The hall was completely filled.
Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assembly was Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.
At that moment, I collapsed.
These people were there because they had courageously and prejudiced their courage and compassion.
What will you choose?
What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?
Are you going to be safe?
Or will you join those who think that we are better than those.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much!
Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.
But I wonder what you say to those who might say that you're holding a TEDTalk, a thinker with draught, working in a posh think tank, so an exception and not the rule.
What would you say to those people?
Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't be fooled. I'm perfectly normal.
I am no exception.
My story is not unusual.
I am as ordinary as it is allowed.
When one looks at the Muslims all over the world, and I did the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world, people want normal things.
They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.
So I am in no way an exception.
If people seem like an exception to rule, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.
HW: thank you very much. Dalia Mogahed.
What began as a platform for hobbyists is about becoming a billionaire business.
Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research facilities worldwide.
Before air package delivery reached our social awareness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRAC Centre in France built a six-metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. a few years ago they began to fly with ropes.
By connecting to each other, flying machines achieve high speed and acceleration in the tightest of spaces.
You can also build self-winding structures.
They have learned to carry loads, deal with turbulence and generally react to natural laws.
Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.
Our aim is to exceed the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight.
In order for a system to work autonomously, it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in the room.
In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.
For today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, an offshoot of our laboratory.
There are no external cameras.
Every flying machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine calculations on board what the machine should do.
"" "external commands are available at the highest level. e. g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""
This is a so-called rear starter,
A flying machine trying to hit two flies with a flap.
Like other starters, it is efficient in advance, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.
Unlike most starters, it can float, and has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile.
However, there is always a downside.
A limitation of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulences like wind arches.
We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.
The idea behind it is that the flight unit will be able to regain the optimum position and improve performance by practicing.
Okay.
During our research, we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that advance at the heart of the matter.
Such a question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?
There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.
Helicopters are known as machines with thousands of movable parts coming together to hurt you.
Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft, which had only two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.
Recently we discovered that flying is working with just one.
This is the monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote controlled aircraft. it was invented recently.
There is only one moving part, a propeller,
No flaps, hinges and cross rudder, no other actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.
Although it is mechanically simple, there is so much happening in the inner life so that it can fly stable and move in space everywhere.
However, it does not have the elegant tail switch algorithm. to get it flying, I have to throw it exactly right.
The probability of throwing it right, if everyone is watching me is small, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.
If the performer is an exercise in intimidity, this machine is here, the Omnihead with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.
What to do with all this abundance?
They see that it is only symmetrical.
Therefore it is ambivalent in its alignment.
As a result, he receives the extraordinary capacity,
Moving in space in all directions, no matter which direction it is rotated or even rotated.
Of course it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers among the eight propellers.
Some are available in models, the rest is learned directly at flying.
Let's take a look at this.
If flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.
This machine is made up of two separate twin propeller aircraft.
This turns clockwise
And the other counter-clockwise.
When assembling them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.
However, if something goes wrong -- an engine or propeller fails, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further if also restricted.
We will now demonstrate this by making half flightless.
The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.
The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.
We took commercial micro-quadcopters -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.
Each unit knows where it is in the room and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.
Hopefully these demonstrations motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.
The particularly safe press on the other hand would like to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.
Of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology.
For types like us, wages are in development and the creative act.
It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that there are creative, clever creatures allowed to form them in such a spectacular way.
The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.
Thank you very much.
At 1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled around each other in a very far distant galaxy, turning the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second in pure energy.
These short moments they lit more brightly than all stars in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.
It was a very big bang.
But they did not use their energy in the form of light --
We finally speak of black holes.
The entire energy was released into space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.
Let us first arrange the events in time.
More than 1.3 billion years ago, there was just a multi-cell life on Earth.
Since then, the Earth has produced quite a few: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God help us -- even the Internet.
About 25 years ago, a group of particularly brave -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector in order to search for gravitational waves, which are caused by colliding black holes.
Most of them thought they were crazy.
But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.
After decades of development, design, design and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the Laser-Interferometer Gravity Wave-Observatory.
In the follow-up period, the precision of Ligo increased significantly, which improved the detection performance enormously.
Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.
In early September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, persistent problems.
On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes passed through the earth.
They went through you and me
And also through the detector.
Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:
The Birth of my Daughter
And the farewell to my sick father.
Basically, these were the fruits of my life.
All that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves from black holes and their observatories, like Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?
A wave of gravity is a ripple in the structure of space and time.
When passing the wave, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and stout into the other.
For illustration, lecturers often perform an upright dance in courses relating to the theory of relativity.
"stretch and stow, stretch and stow."
The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.
On September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched and stowed upon arrival of the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.
This means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by 1. therefore, one explained the Ligo-workers for crazy.
With a five-kilometer laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured at less than one thousandth of the radius of a nuclear nucleus. this is grotesque.
At the end of his classical text about gravity
"" "Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the chase after the waves as follows:" "" "the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous." ""
"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public certainly all obstacles will be overcome." "" "" ""
Thorne released this in 1973, 42 years before his success.
Back to Ligo. Scott prefers to say Ligo is more an ear than an eye.
I would like to explain what this means.
Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.
This is quite practical, because in this way you can create a picture or a map of things by seeing the light coming from several points around you.
This is different in sounds.
Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.
That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that particularly mean a lot to you:
About your child's face.
Instead we listen to certain features like pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to make the story behind it.
"" "" "" "now just Alice is talking." "" "" ""
"" "" "" "and Bob is interrupting her." "" "" ""
"stupid Bob."
The same goes for gravitational-waves.
With them we cannot create simple images of objects in space.
But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of waves we can listen to their stories.
At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.
So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe speak.
Listening to the gravity can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time.
SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just around: wupp!
If the two bodies are very fast, you hear the same circus with an additional tone change. this sounds like: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!
It is a kind of movement vocabulary, engraved in the waveform.
AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrender sound] No one knows what to listen to, this recognises as sound of -- SH:... two black holes each with 30-fold solar mass that rotate approximately as fast as the rods of your mixer.
AA: let's briefly consider what this means.
Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, orbit a hundred times per second before they collide.
Imagine these forces.
Fantastic.
And we know about it because we have heard it.
Therein lies the lasting significance of Ligo.
Ligo ebnet is paving an entirely new way to explore the universe as never before.
On this path we can listen to the All and hear the invisible.
Much in space we can not see -- practical or basically -- not.
A super-nova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in supernovae.
They are very useful. from them we have learned a lot about the universe.
The exciting physical processes are happening in the nucleus, which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.
We will never see through since these opak are.
Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them because the Big Bang is obscured by its own reflection.
Through gravitational waves it should be possible to look back right up to the beginning.
And the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, we will never see and of which we have no idea. things we only discover by listening.
In fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt that we had not expected.
My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this subject: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes like Ligo they are watching are the dinosaurs of the universe.
They are enormous, age-old bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak, the Sauriknochen for our archaeological work.
Ligo gives us a completely different perspective on what happened in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately also how we came out of this chaos.
AA: the challenge now is to be as bold as possible.
Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great metal detectors and listen to the cosmos's noise and circus.
We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on earth and in space.
For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang?
Now is the time of great dreams.
Dream with us.
Thank you.
Some time ago, I tried out an experiment.
"" "for one year I would say" "" "Yes!" "" "to which I was afraid." ""
No matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say "yes."
Do I want to speak to the public?
No, but yes!
Wanted to be live on TV?
No, but yes!
Did I want to start playing with the show?
No, no, no, yes, yes.
And a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I was afraid of, removed my fear.
My fear of keeping speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, gone.
The power of a word is impressive.
"" "" "" "yes" "" "changed my life." ""
"" "" "" "yes" "" "changed me." ""
"" "but there was a certain" "" "yes" "" "that changed my life deeply, to an unexpected way. it started with a question of my little ones." ""
"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "" "estimation" "" "for unexplainable reasons," ""
As if she were a waitress from the south.
"" "" "" "estimating, I need milk for my beak-cup." "" "" ""
"" "she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," "" "Yes." "" "" ""
This Yes was the beginning
From then on, I disturbed myself to always play with them once you ask me. no matter what I'm doing or where I'm going, I always say yes -- every single time.
Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very tired.
It has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family.
"" "but it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the" "" "yes" "" "say to play with my children saved my career." ""
I have a real dream job.
I am a writer. I think things out, you awaken to life.
Dream job.
No. no.
I am a Titan.
Dream job.
I created television. I produce television.
I do television, in great style.
In this TV season I am responsible for putting 70 hours of program into the world.
Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are in production at the same time.
Every mission offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.
The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.
Let's say five.
A new episode every nine days, four television programs, 70 hours TV, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programmes that are simultaneously in production, times four, 16 episodes: scandalous, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,
350 million dollars for a season.
In America my TV series run one after the other on Thursday evening.
All over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.
My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I created myself, and not just produced, so on top of it. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the camp fire and tell my stories.
Four TV series, 70 hours TV, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires burning around the world.
Do you know who else does it?
No one, that's why I'm a Titan.
Dream job.
I don't want to impress you with this.
"" "I say it because I know what you think when the word" "" "author" "" "falls." ""
I tell you that all of you who work so hard, whether you are managing a company, a country or a classroom, take a business or a household, take me seriously when I talk about work, so that you understand that I don't just mess around on the computer and fancy, and it's true when I say: I don't understand that a dream job is not about dreams.
It's all a job, all work, everything reality, everything blood, sweat -- no tears.
I work a lot, hard and I love it.
When I'm deepened into the work, there is no other feeling.
My work always creates a country out of nothing.
It is as if I stopped troops when I painted on a canvas.
As if one had a high tone, ran a marathon.
You feel like Beyoncé.
And all that at the same time.
I love to work.
She is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and motherly, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is the buzz.
There is such a change in me when the work is going well.
A buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy street, I could go on it forever.
Many people accept when I explain to them the sums that I'm talking about writing that writing is fun for me.
Don't understand me wrong, it does it.
But the hum -- when I began to work and work and work, build, create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this humming, this energy. the sums!
The sums are more than writing.
Buzzing is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.
The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.
The humming is God's voice in my ear.
And if you have such a buzz, then you can't strive to be different from size.
The feeling of not being able to aspire to size, no matter what price.
This is called buzzing.
Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.
Maybe it's called genius.
Perhaps ego is called ego.
Perhaps it's the fear of failure.
I don't know.
I just know that I'm not made for failure, and I just know that I love the tottering.
I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know that I don't want to question it.
In order to make it clear: the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more work there is, the more work there is, the more things are happening, the more I write history, the more expectations there is.
The more I work to be successful, the more I need to work.
And what did I say about work?
I love work, isn't it?
The land I created, the Marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high clay, the totals, the totals, the totals.
I like this sum. I love the sums.
I need the sums. I am the hum.
Am I just this humming?
And then the tottering stopped.
Revised, overstressed, exaggerated, burned out.
The buzz stopped.
Now my three daughters are used to the truth that her mum is a single stitch.
"" "Harper tells people:" "" "my mom won't be there, but you can write my nanny." "" "" ""
"" "and Emerson says," "" "Estimate, I want to go to Shonda-Land." "" "" ""
These are the children of a Titans.
They are baby titans.
They were 12, 3 and 1, when the humming ceased.
The sums of the engine were speechless.
I didn't love my job any more. the engine was out.
The sums did not come back.
My sums were broken.
I made the same things as always: the same Titanic work, 15 hours-long, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegating, a Titan does not sleep, does not give up, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.
But there was no buzz.
In me was silence.
Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.
Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...
I was the perfect Titan.
I was a showcase-titanium,
Everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore.
And that was my life.
Everything I did.
I was the hum and the sums I was.
So what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade away?
"" "I know some may think:" "" "hypocrites, stupid author-titanium." "" "" ""
But you know you're doing it, you're doing it, you're working to be a teacher, being a banker, being a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love someone else and that gives you the buzz when you know the sums already when the buzz stops, who is you then?
What are you?
What am I?
Am I still a Titan?
When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?
"" "and then my" "" "southern state waitress" "" "asks me a question." ""
"" "I'm on the way out, late and she says," "" "Mom, do you like playing?" "" "" ""
And I want to say no, when two things become aware of me:
"" "first, I must say yes to all and secondly, it didn't call me" "" "estimating" "". "" ""
"" "she calls no one any more" "" "estimation" "". "" ""
When did that happen?
I miss it when I'm Titan and my buzzing shrouds, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.
"" "and so she says," "" "Mum, do you like playing?" "" "" ""
And I say, "Yes."
Nothing special about that.
"" "we play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" "" "Everybody Poops" "". "" ""
Nothing extraordinary.
But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in solitude and lack of money, I can't do anything except to watch out.
I am focused.
I'm quiet.
The land I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone - they no longer exist.
All that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl is releasing into "The Ice Queen."
Everywhere is peace and simplicity.
The air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.
I can hardly believe that I breathe.
Playing is the opposite of works.
And I am happy.
Something in me dissolves.
A mental door opens and an energy rush comes in.
And that not immediately, but it happens, it happens.
I feel it.
The buzzing slowly returns.
No full volume, barely there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.
Not the sums, but a sum.
And now I feel like I know a magical mystery.
But let's stick to the matter.
It is love. that's all.
No secret. no secret. only love.
It is something we have forgotten.
The sums, the working sum, the titanium dioxide, this is just the replacement.
If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am when I describe myself with the help of broadcasts and TV lessons and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.
Buzzing is not a force and it is not labour-specific.
It depends on the joy.
The real buzz is dependent on love.
The buzz is the stream that comes from the zest of life.
The real buzz is self-confidence and peace.
The real buzz ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be accomplished, the expectation and the pressure.
The real buzz is simple and original.
The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for which god told me that I am a Titan?
It is simply love.
We all need a little more love, much more love.
As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.
I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from all guilt as a workaholic.
It is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice, if I want to hear the summing again.
I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.
I don't seem to play in such a way as to work.
The truth hurts,
But I don't like to play it.
I always work because I love it.
I prefer to work at the workplace as at home.
This admission is painful, because what a person prefers to be at home?
Well, I know.
"" "honestly, I call myself" "" "Titan" "" "--" ""
I have to have problems.
That I am too relaxed is none of them.
We are racing around in the garden, in front of and back, back and forth.
We make small dance parties,
We sing and play ball.
We burst soap bubbles.
I mostly feel stiff, absent and puzzled.
I always grab my mobile phone.
But it is ok.
My children show me how to live, and the humming of the universe fills me.
I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?
You can also do it! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.
Perhaps you keep me naive for a daydreamer.
You're right, but you can do it too!
You have time!
And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a muppet show figure.
Your child will find you less interesting than you think.
It is only 15 minutes.
My little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something different.
It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.
After 15 minutes a ladybug or biscuit replaces me.
And when my teenage daughter talks to me for 15 minutes, I am the mother of the year.
It's just 15 minutes, more needn't need it.
Each can bring 15 minutes on the piece, even on a bad day of whim!
15 minutes on the track!
No mobile phone, no clothes, no distraction.
The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to pray.
But 15 minutes are in it!
My children are my feeliness, my world. they don't have to be the children. it is important to feel the buzz, have a place for peace of mind.
It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,
"" "to play" "" "games" "" "in general." ""
Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!
Find out what you're doing well.
Find out and preserve it.
I'm not perfect in it. I fail and I win. meet friends, read books, enjoy the day --
"" "" "" "do you want to play?" "" "is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training when I wanted to exceed myself more and more." ""
15 minutes on the piece, why not treat yourself to 15 minutes?
What can be wrong with it? nothing!
The buzzing came back in my spare time. the buzzing seems to come back when I don't work.
Working does not work without playing.
It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself again in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.
I like the sums, but I don't love it.
I don't need it.
I am not the sums, the sums are not me... no more.
Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.
This is my sum now.
The tottering of life.
The tottering of love.
The buzz of work is part of me, but only a part. and I am so grateful for that.
It's up to me that I'm a Titan. I have never seen a Titan who plays travel to Jerusalem.
I said yes to less work and more games.
And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my campfires are still burning.
The more I play, the happier I and my children.
The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.
The more I play, the more clear my head is.
The more I play, the better I work.
The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the country I am creating, the marathon, which I run, the troops, the canvases, the high clay, the buzzing, the buzzing, the other, the right buzz: the totality of life.
The more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, lasting, bare and new feeling of life is growing in me. less Titan -- more I!
The more I feel exactly that hum, the more I know who I am.
I'm a writer. I think things out, I'm raising you to life.
This belongs to the job, which means living his dream.
This is the dream of this job,
For a dream job should be a little dreamy.
"" "I said" "" "Yes" "" "to less work and more games." ""
Titans don't have a chance here.
"" "" "" "do you want to play?" "" "" ""
Thank you very much.
I am a neurosurgeon.
Like most of my colleagues, I have to deal with human tragedies every day.
I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke or after a car accident.
For us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.
After a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent disability.
This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.
What is a functional neurosurgeon?
A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures.
They certainly have one of the most well-known, the "deep brain stimulation." an electrode is implanted in the brain in order to influence the switching circles of the neurons in such a way that the neurological function improves.
It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease suffering from severe trembling and severe pain.
Neuromodulation however does not mean neuro-healing.
The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the recovery of the brain.
In my opinion, we approach this dream.
I would like to show you that we are very close.
With some help, the brain can help itself.
The story began 15 years ago.
At that time I was senior doctor and worked day and night in emergency.
I often provided patients with a skull-brain trauma.
They have to imagine that in skull-brain trauma the brain swells and the skull pressure increases.
In order to save life, it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull.
To do this, sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.
Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist.
What do I mean by that?
We wanted to let cells grow from this tissue.
This is not an easy task.
To let cells grow from a tissue piece is similar to very small children who are taken out of their families.
You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and surroundings to thrive.
That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.
After many attempts Jean-François managed it.
He saw this under his microscope.
That was a big surprise for us.
Why?
It looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.
Perhaps you know from biology classes that stem cells are immature cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism.
The adult brain has stem cells but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.
It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.
We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they split very quickly.
They never die, they are immortal.
But these cells behaved differently.
They spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died.
So we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.
We needed a long time to understand where they came from.
They originate from these cells.
These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.
We all have them in our brain.
They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.
They play a very important role in our development.
At the stage of the fetus they care for the folding of the brain.
But why don't they get us?
We don't know that.
We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain as we find them in higher concentrations of brain injuries.
But this is not so certain.
One thing is clear, however -- of these cells we received our stem cells.
We are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing.
We had to prove that.
So we decided to develop an experiment.
We wanted to take a piece of brain mass out of the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.
And then mark them in color to be able to follow them in the brain.
In the last step we re-implanted them at the reception point of the same individual.
We call the autologous transplant -- Autotransplantation.
One of our first questions was: what happens if we are re-importing these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we are using the same cells in foamed brain tissue?
Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.
In the first scenario, we implanted the cells in a healthy brain, and we observed that they disappeared completely after a few weeks as if they had been removed, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not used there, so they disappear.
In the second scenario we added a violation and re-implanted exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew into mature neurons.
Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.
These are the cells that have been reimplanted.
The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells that we dye in vitro, in culture.
Of course we couldn't stop here.
Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?
So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.
They had to take feed pellets of a tray.
They did that very well.
When they reached a stable level of dexterity, we injured the motor-motor range in the motor cortex.
After that, the monkeys were paralysed, they could not move their hand any more.
Just as it would happen in people, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.
The patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic cerebral mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just like the monkey.
When we were certain that the ape had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells.
On the left side they see the monkey, who recovered spontaneously.
It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from prior to injury.
It is not so precise and not so fast.
Now see when we reimplanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after plantation.
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.
Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.
We can freeze them and use them later.
We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.
But our dream still is to imitate it in humans.
I really hope that I can show you soon, how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.
Thank you very much.
Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think, "I know someone who can need that."
I definitely.
Of course, the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials in humans.
Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results, one has to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies.
BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, and so on.
JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.
BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available.
JB: that's hard to say.
First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.
Will the authority allow us to start it soon?
Then one has to carry out this study with a small group of patients.
It takes a long time to choose the patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment.
Then you have to apply it to a multicenter study.
You must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.
BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.
BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it.
BG: thank you very much.
Democracy.
We in the West make a big mistake to look at them as a matter of course.
We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it really is, but as an inventory of our society.
We tend to consider them as an immutable entity.
We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.
This is not true.
Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.
In fact democracy dwindles with us, in Europe.
At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally explained to me as Minister of Finance in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not affect the austerity programs that were realized in Greece.
At this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rebellious friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would be abolished if it were to change anything.
At this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy.
I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Euro Group are mistaken, we could save us democracy, but that we need a true and defenceless democracy.
"" "" "" "for without democracy, our societies will become more bleak, our future gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted." ""
On the topic of waste I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our economies.
"" "I call it the twin-summit paradox." "" "" ""
A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt that casts his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.
We all recognize the mountain of debt,
But few recognize his twin.
A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to wealthy depositors and corporations, who are too anxious to invest there where it would be productive and income to produce the debt that humanity urgently needs, for example "green" energy.
I call them two numbers.
In the past 3 months, in the USA, in England and in the eurozone, 3,4 trillion US dollars have been invested in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, rail, equipment and so on and so forth.
3.4 trillion US dollars sound after a lot of money until one compares it to the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time circulated in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing to inflate the stock exchanges and raise the real estate prices.
Thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks which are not equalled by the usual market mechanisms.
The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year olds in the U.S., Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand, which, like in an endless loop, boosts the pessimism of investors, which, like in an endless loop, could boost the pessimism of investors in which they do not invest.
Unintentionally causes the circumstances that cause oilpus to kill him.
This is my coat with capitalism --
"" "" "" "all unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to further develop human talents and especially to finance all the technologies," "" "green" "" "technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth." ""
So is democracy the solution?
But before we proceed, what do we mean by democracy?
Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.
The Athenian democracy, of course, closed too many --
Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.
"" "" "" "however, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Athenian democracy on the basis of these exclusions." ""
The decisive thing about the Athenian democracy was and is that it involved the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they allowed them the right to political co-determination with the same voice weighting in questions of the state cheek.
The Athenian democracy did not last for a long time --
Like a candle, which shines very bright, it is also quickly burned out.
However, our liberal democracies have not their roots in ancient Athens,
But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.
While Athenian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers.
For the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- the world of the corporations -- became a democratic zone.
In our present democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, there was a relentless struggle between the two, by gradually undermining politics and expropriating it.
Are you wondering why politicians are no longer the same as before?
It is not part of a degeneration of its DNA.
It is because nowadays it is possible to be in the government and still not in power, because the power is diverted from politics into the economy and the areas are separated.
I mentioned my hair with capitalism.
If you think about it, it is like a herd of carnivores, which so sustainably decimated the animals from which they feed, that they end up starving at the end.
Similarly, it is with the economy that has so far canniated politics that it hurts itself through the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations is growing, political goods are devalued, the inequality increases, the general economic demand falls and the managers of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies.
The more successful capitalism drives the "demos" out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity.
If that is true, it is obvious that we must reunite politics and economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keep control, as in ancient Athens, apart from exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.
By the way, this is not a new idea.
The Marxian Left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.
The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and waste.
But there is a solution: to abolish the working poor!
Capitalism is doing it by replacing low-wage workers with automation and robots.
The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the extravagance sublime, and social conflicts more deeply, just like it -- already very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China will come.
So we must restructure the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure we are democratizing the reunited area, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy which makes the film "Matrix" appear as a documentation.
So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements he has produced --
The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in "matrix" or by something similar to the society in "Star Trek," in which machines serve the people and the people put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenian "Agora," in long conversations with the meaning of life.
I think we should be optimistic.
So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" like utopia rather than the "Matrix" similar dystopia?
In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples.
In the business sector, please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next, from one firm to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company.
Then all revenues from capital and revenues arise and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.
No distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work in it, and employees working there where the company does not belong. no more exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no uplifting twin peaks.
In the area of global political economy, please note that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest Emerging Markets], in the interests of all mankind.
Suppose the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- let us call it "the cosmos," into entities of "cosmos" -- and each government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund.
Imagine that this fund is investing in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.
This is not a new idea.
It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.
The problem was that at that time you did not have the technical means to implement it.
"" "" "" "today we have them, especially against the backdrop of a reunited policy and economy." ""
The world I describe to you is at the same time a Liberal, in which they prefer privileged individuals, and Marxist, because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the trash of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.
But above all, it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy.
Will we wake up in such a world?
"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""
The answer depends on how we decide politically together.
It is in our hands and we do it better democratic.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani writes: Yanis...
You describe yourself as liberal Marxists in your biography itself.
How relevant is Marx's analysis today?
Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.
The reason for the reunification of politics and economics is... Do we not do that, technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers describes as "long-term stagnation."
By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we see it up-to-date, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is small.
If this analysis is applicable, then Marx is quite relevant,
Just like Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am completely confused.
BG: in fact, and now we are.
YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough.
BG: this is a very Greek, kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said that. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you think from the West's point of view on China.
Would you like to repeat it here?
YV: there is a great measure of hypocrisy.
We have the appearance of democracy in our liberal democracies.
As I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays - the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone.
In a sense, if I can say so provocatively, China today resembles the England of the 19th century.
For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically considered.
Liberalism, Liberals like John Stuart Mill
He was particularly sceptical concerning democratic development.
What one can now observe in China resembles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.
China is now proposing to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells of hypocrisy.
BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.
YV: I suspected that this is coming.
BG: yes...
How do you look back six months later in the first half of the year?
YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the eurozone,
Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,
"" "" "" "to say good-bye to complacency and ongoing denial that a massive fault line went through the eurozone, and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the entire European Union." ""
We had the opportunity on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which by the way, was the first suggestion that revealed this denial.
Unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the Euro Group, have continued to choose the denial.
But you know what comes.
This is the experience of the Soviet Union --
If you try to get an economic system that is not viable by political will and authoritarianism, you might be able to delay it for a while, but when the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive.
BG: what changes do you anticipate?
YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.
BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?
YV: everyday.
BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Seriously...
If there is a finance minister or any minister who, after 6 months in office, particularly in such a tense situation, claims he has made no mistake, then it is a dangerous person.
Of course I made mistakes.
The biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt programme at the end of February.
I believed that there was an honest interest on the part of the financiers to find a common solution.
But that didn't exist.
They only wanted to bring our government down, only because they did not want to deal with the distortions that were going on through the eurozone.
They didn't want to admit that for 5 years they had been a disastrous program in Greece.
We lost one third of our nominal GDP.
"" "there is worse than during" "" "Great Depression." "" "" ""
"" "none of the troika who imposed this policy on us admitted:" "" "that was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""
BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of talks, you seem to be quite pro-European.
YV: absolutely.
"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe." ""
"" "" "" "my biggest fear is that the eurozone does not survive." ""
For if they do not survive, the freestanding centrifuges will be demonic and destroy the European Union.
"" "" "" "this will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy." ""
We are probably the strongest economy in the world.
"" "" "" "if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post-modern 1930, according to which it seems to me, it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as non-Europeans." ""
BG: we hope that you are wrong at this point.
Yanis, thank you for being with TED.
YV: thank you.
Many have never heard of Roy Price even though he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.
Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.
This goes back to the decision that Roy has met three years ago.
Roy Price is an employee at Amazon Studio,
The Amazon TV production company.
He is 47 years old, slim, has a refreshment and refers to Twitter as "Movies, TV, Technology, Tacos."
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.
Of course, this is a very hard-fought industry.
There are so many TV series that Roy does not have any choice.
He has to find shows that are very, very good.
In other words, he has to find shows that are on the right of this curve.
This curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows this review will receive.
If your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner.
Then you have a successful show.
These are shows like Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire, "all the shows that are addictive, where, after a season has looked, your brain asks:" where are more of these episodes? "
This kind of show.
On the left side, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough about what's going on at this end of the turn.
"" "Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to prohibit" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "". "" ""
He makes more thoughts about the average culmination, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't inspire.
So he must make sure that he really is on the right side.
The pressure is present, and of course it's the first time that Amazon is doing something like that, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything.
He wants to create success.
He needs guaranteed success so he holds a competition.
He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents them online, where everyone can watch for free.
And if Amazon doesn't get things out for free, it's up to you, right?
Millions of viewers watch these episodes.
But they do not know that they are watched when watching these shows.
They are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything.
You capture when you start the show when you pause, what parts one skips or looks over again.
They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.
"" "in fact, they collect the data, process them, and this results in the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a Sitcom about four Republican US senators." "" "" ""
They made this show.
Does anybody know the name of this show?
"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many people can remember this show because it wasn't that good." ""
It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this turn is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.
About the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a little different.
Instead of staging a contest, he and his team watched the existing data on the Netflix Viewer, so the reviews that they give the shows their course, which shows they like etc.
Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors.
When they had all the parts together, they took a venture and decided not to make a Sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a senator.
Do you know this show?
Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.
"" "" "" "house of Cards" "" "gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go." ""
Of course, the question is: what has happened here?
It has two very competitive, data-sealed companies.
They connect these many data to each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.
What is this?
Because logic somehow says that it should work with everything.
When you collect millions of data for a decision you make, you should make a good decision.
You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.
You optimize it with very powerful computers.
The minimum thing you can expect is good television, right?
If data analysis does not work this way, this is something frightening, because we live in a time where we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television.
Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems here?
Nobody. OK, that's good.
Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes into contact with this software in this room. come into contact with it, you are in jail.
If someone is in jail in the U.S. and asks for discharge, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether or not it is released.
Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will decide whether a person will be good or bad.
Moderate television, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.
Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,
Not always the best results are generated. that's not because a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.
The data of the most experienced companies is also incorrect.
Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.
In 2009, Google announced that, through data analysis outbursts of flu, the bad way, they can predict -- through data analysis of Google searches.
"" "it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine" "" "Nature." "" "" ""
It worked fine, year around year, until suddenly it didn't work anymore,
And no one could say why.
It simply didn't work, this again was a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine "Nature."
Even the data of the most experienced companies, such as Amazon and Google, sometimes misunderstand something.
Despite all these errors, data flows into decisions of life -- at the workplace, in the enforcement of law, in medicine.
So we should make sure that data is helpful.
I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and unsuccessful decisions. this pattern should be propagated.
If you have to solve a complex problem, mainly do two things:
First, disassemble this problem in its individual parts so that you can analyse the items; as a second, put the items together again to make a decision.
Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.
And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.
Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to disassemble a problem and to understand its parts.
They are not suitable to reassemble the parts and then come to a decision.
There is a different tool for this and we have it all: our brain.
If there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to reassemble parts and pieces, even if the information is incomplete, in order to get a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert.
Therefore, I believe Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process.
They use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have not been capable of. but deciding how to take all these parts together again and make a show like "House of Cards" is not in the data.
Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision.
Amazon however did this in the wrong way.
They used data to control all their decisions first when they were competing for TV ideas, then they chose "Alpha House" as a show.
"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say," "" "This is what the data tells us." "" "" ""
It did not lead to the desired result.
Data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe things are going wrong when data begin to control our decisions.
No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget this device is quite useful.
Many of you will...
Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.
Many know it.
It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question you only have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.
I will challenge it later with a technical demo.
So far I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball in retrospect.
But, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it with a much more sophisticated approach, such as data analysis to make better decisions.
But this does not change the basic structure.
So maybe the ball will be smarter and smarter. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.
And I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data, it still pays off to make decisions, to be an expert in what one does and risks.
Because in the end it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.
Thank you very much.
