this is James Ris@@ en .
they might know him because he won the Pu@@ li@@ tzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
long before someone had heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA had illeg@@ ally heard phones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a disa@@ strous U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA sur@@ rendered to Iran literally dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has investigated risks and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol for the pattern of the government to condemn whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the needy who reveal it .
so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many brave re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , although they have been saying for years that it would be essential for their case , the government &apos;s demands were dropped . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason : in the era of electronic monitoring , the re@@ porters and sources can always hide less and less .
instead of sh@@ utting and split@@ ting up , it could also do his digital Foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , hid his telephone references secretly ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , his return , and even travel tips with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and ris@@ ens supposed source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary condemned more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article about national security has been the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower going to a journalist .
so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first Constitu@@ ent Assembly because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on all .
but just as technology allows the government to b@@ ypass the rights of re@@ porters , the press can use technologies to better protect their sources .
they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand .
today , there are communication software that didn &apos;t exist when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , originally developed by the internet site of Aaron &apos;s Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , in which I work .
instead of sending an email , go to a news website , like the here of the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server where only the relevant news agency has access .
so the government cannot obtain more information secretly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that end@@ anger all of us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to ensure that not only technological men such as Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to get rid of mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , &quot; &quot; &quot;
or a Wall Street insi@@ der , who warns us of the next financial crisis , warns about ab@@ uses in the supply of soldiers . or the nearest environment agent who al@@ erts alert to the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der who warns us of the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 the biggest data le@@ ck of history has been published . &#93; &#91; the Panama Pap@@ ers reveal that rich and mighty &#93; &#91; We have been asking Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; This week we were asked about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has let@@ ter@@ box offices in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a track of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next disclosed documents .
now it sounds like the P@@ lot of an agent or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems crying away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should this happen to us ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
all over the world media and leading politicians , like secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens , are used by a few to hide and obsc@@ ure their fortun@@ es -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these il@@ lic@@ it .
it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters .
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
presumably because there have so far been no prominent Americans who came forward in these revelations , this scandal .
now it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but due to the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ck from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US .
in fact , in some US states you need less information , you need to provide less information to create a company than to obtain a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
frau@@ d@@ sters have allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off particularly vulnerable jet@@ ties .
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks like .
how does this work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 bar firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring susp@@ icious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really shocked the fact that all except one lawyer made proposals to our investig@@ ators how he could transfer his money .
none of these lawyers approached us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
it is not a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian , involved in a scandal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and in order to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game .
we have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult .
this may sound very dull as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing had ever changed , as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite a lot of things started to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have seen more transparency as far as the owners of companies are concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the EU has been collecting key governance at a national level , who really is behind firms in Europe and who controls them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the USA hin@@ ders here .
representatives of both parties have tab@@ led a bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see this Panama @-@ Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ lamps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy to get up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this kind of in@@ transparency by laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end the in@@ transparency that is now enabling this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a sale of the farm .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed standing and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip across the country . after that he would go to the Peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are you sleeping tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what am I doing now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the Peace Corps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to get kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a Maz@@ da !
this is a small luggage compartment !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; u@@ h , please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at night I lay in bed , I gaz@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I get in there ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of bed , sne@@ e@@ zing on to@@ e tips to the door , and shut my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
maybe the people who were sold to me when I was a stranger were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress with .
let &apos;s take a leap , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost bank@@ rupt , my room@@ mate is pulling out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it , transform fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , plus a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air matt@@ resses and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on the wooden floor .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham om@@ el@@ ettes tasted completely different because we made it for our guests .
we tou@@ red all the city with them . when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I started .
had we just discovered that at the same time we were able to find new friends and pay our rent ?
things were rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if this could be a business concept .
so we presented to investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publish publicly pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors are closed when visitors come by .
through the internet , they can then invite other people to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the rocket to ign@@ ite .
but they do not act .
no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we all learned that foreigners are dangerous .
if one has a problem , one ob@@ serves the things that one can do well . we were able to design .
at the Academy of Art , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we were striving for .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hands .
now I &apos;d like you to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left sitting @-@ neighbour .
this silent flight of panic that you are now feeling -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can &apos;t only read your SMS , they can see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most people feel the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason can our company exist .
just so , who &apos;s actually Al G@@ ores &apos;s mobile phone ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he is candidate for the Office of the President ?
you can now return the cell phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I want to tell you about some of the discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first imagined his name ; if he had told where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine that you would have 150 assessments , all of which say , &quot; He can really get hold of very well @-@ designed cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
a well thought @-@ out feedback system significantly strengthens trust .
in the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to leave negative jud@@ gements .
finally , we decided to wait until both host and guest left their assessments before we set them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are regarding age and place of residence .
not surprisingly we trust people most , who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting if you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
if you have fewer than three assessments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good reputation is common . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
we also learned that trust is dependent on how much money is available .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little how , for example , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you won &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too much , for example , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother -- -- the request isn &apos;t accepted either . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; Great works of art in your apartment ! I &apos;m making holidays with my family . &quot;
how can you create it with design to create this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on how to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we didn &apos;t reck@@ on was the great amount of people who were more than willing to put down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
three things can be recognized .
first : incredibly good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
thir@@ dly , a need which had not been covered before .
business is very good for us .
of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who have been part@@ ying un@@ allowed parties or have rav@@ aged apartments .
hosts have left guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood on the front line when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than those calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think about it .
the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , only a fraction of 123 million overnight stays had a problem .
for people are in accordance with each other rightly .
if trust works , something wonderful can emerge .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers who tend to have heart attacks because of se@@ dent@@ ary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are true gu@@ ardian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know one .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital if you die and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want people to feel lonely they pass books .
they can stay longer without charge of extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course not every stay runs off .
but these relationships behind the pure monetary transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions work together ?
it is a matter of economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now it is simply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; share Economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; describes a trade which promises human relationships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people place a part of themselves openly , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , it is easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if trips were a rich buffet made of local impressions ?
what if at every place one visits , a group of residents would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one in a pub @-@ tur@@ pent@@ ine neighborhood of which one has never heard of ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from the ground up to each other ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of sharing one &apos;s share ?
I imagine cities that enable us society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
this project has already begun in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul . many parking spaces owned by the government have already begun .
have been offered to residents . students who were looking for a lead ,
were taught to people whose children were educated , and incu@@ b@@ ate programmes were launched ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ invent the wheel .
there was also a warm hospitality before .
there have been similar websites in front of us .
so why exactly did our work work ?
apart from luck and timing we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I think that &apos;s amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da drives past me .
we know , of course , that design can &apos;t solve any problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this big impact , I wonder what we can use in the near future .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
one study found that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that the Americans think that most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim , it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a w@@ ann@@ abe fitness fan@@ atics ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born like that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have decided to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ ch myself .
no , not as a homos@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friend@@ ships were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : back then it was a feminist declaration of independence , in contrast to the pressure that I felt as a 17 year old , to adapt to a perfect and in@@ accessible beauty ideal .
I have not only adopted the faith of my parents pas@@ sively .
I have strug@@ gled with the Qur &apos;an .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted , and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
have you ever had the feeling that somebody is perc@@ ei@@ ving you , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves you ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I got married and started , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I was sitting in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot;
there was smoke , planes flying in buildings , people jumped from the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical mal@@ function ?
my shock quickly turned into rebellion .
why should we do something like that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I switched to the television channel and heard &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Middle Eastern origin ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my God .
not only my country was attacked , but in the N@@ u the actions of others were transformed by a citizen into a susp@@ icious person .
on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I was going to be silent -- as deep as I went into my seat , and I was the first time I was known to be recognized as Muslim .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be watch@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it became Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings came : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting .
understand@@ ably , the feelings were un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims , or by people who were considered Muslims to be free and struck .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have put the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays we can actually hear people say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we get rid of it ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and make mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the US body .
it is just the question : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know that a malign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less , because the question is wrong .
like all the other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America more secure ?
there may be a few parking spaces , but not stopping the terror .
regular visits to a mosque leads to a more tolerant approach to people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
and as I told me a leader of the police in the Washington DC area , DC recently told me : people are actually not being radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are ra@@ dic@@ alized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
in the process of radi@@ cal@@ isation it has been found that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family , so that the extrem@@ ist group may have a bra@@ in@@ washing which causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or dis@@ liked by faith .
if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we have to stop people going to the mosque .
some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS bases its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , I think we need to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would fit into their imag@@ inations by recognis@@ ing them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology based on their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when you look at them , they don &apos;t do what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preten@@ ded to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . every minister with whom she spoke , she sil@@ enced and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing , and something that would have made sense to her anger , she was a main target for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution .
this Ima@@ m re @-@ established the connection with God and its church .
instead of acc@@ using her for her anger , he showed her constructive ways of real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque was to join the IS .
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear we pass at least three things .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formity and prejudi@@ ce .
one study reveals that when people submit messages that have been reported neg@@ atively about Muslims , they are more likely to have military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you are looking at the time when the Muslims &apos; mood shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I have expected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
perhaps we feel it first , but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms us all .
when assign@@ ing collective guilt it is not just about self @-@ explaining .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was talented , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is such an accomplished young man from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting in the afternoon .
he shot De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism may not only be im@@ moral , but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mosque or were we safe at home ?
we discussed it and it was not an easy decision for us , because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we chose the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we drove through silence , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , pulled out my shoes , went to the prayer hall , and what I saw let me pause .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assembly was Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment , I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had cour@@ age@@ ously and prejudi@@ ced their courage and compassion .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you going to be safe ?
or will you join those who think that we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who might say that you &apos;re holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , working in a pos@@ h think tank , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fo@@ ol@@ ed . I &apos;m perfectly normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as ordinary as it is allowed .
when one looks at the Muslims all over the world , and I did the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
if people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you very much . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about becoming a billi@@ on@@ aire business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research facilities worldwide .
before air package delivery reached our social awareness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRA@@ C Centre in France built a six @-@ metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . a few years ago they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting to each other , flying machines achieve high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test of spaces .
you can also build self @-@ winding structures .
they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to exceed the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , an off@@ shoot of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
every flying machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at the highest level . e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flying machine trying to hit two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in advance , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
unlike most star@@ ters , it can float , and has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ences like wind arches .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight unit will be able to regain the optimum position and improve performance by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that advance at the heart of the matter .
such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of mov@@ able parts coming together to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft , which had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying is working with just one .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simplest remote controlled aircraft . it was invented recently .
there is only one moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross ru@@ dder , no other actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , there is so much happening in the inner life so that it can fly stable and move in space everywhere .
however , it does not have the elegant tail switch algorithm . to get it flying , I have to throw it exactly right .
the probability of throwing it right , if everyone is watching me is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
if the performer is an exercise in in@@ timi@@ dity , this machine is here , the Omni@@ head with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
therefore it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
as a result , he receives the extraordinary capacity ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter which direction it is rot@@ ated or even rot@@ ated .
of course it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers among the eight prop@@ ellers .
some are available in models , the rest is learned directly at flying .
let &apos;s take a look at this .
if flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate twin prop@@ eller aircraft .
this turns clock@@ wise
and the other counter @-@ clock@@ wise .
when assembling them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , if something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller fails , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further if also restricted .
we will now demonstrate this by making half f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ters -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where it is in the room and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe press on the other hand would like to become a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology .
for types like us , wages are in development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that there are creative , clever creatures allowed to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
at 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cled around each other in a very far distant gal@@ axy , turning the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second in pure energy .
these short moments they lit more bri@@ ghtly than all stars in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not use their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us first arrange the events in time .
more than 1.3 billion years ago , there was just a multi @-@ cell life on Earth .
since then , the Earth has produced quite a few : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God help us -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly brave -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector in order to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by colli@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , design and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the Laser @-@ Interfer@@ ometer Gra@@ vity Wave @-@ Observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o increased significantly , which improved the detection performance enormously .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
in early September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes passed through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
and the farewell to my sick father .
basically , these were the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and their observ@@ atories , like Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a wave of gravity is a ri@@ pple in the structure of space and time .
when passing the wave , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and st@@ out into the other .
for illustration , lec@@ turers often perform an upright dance in courses relating to the theory of rel@@ ativity .
&quot; stretch and st@@ ow , stretch and st@@ ow . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and st@@ owed upon arrival of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by 1 . therefore , one explained the Lig@@ o @-@ workers for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometer laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured at less than one thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nuclear nucle@@ us . this is grot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gravity
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the chase after the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public certainly all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne released this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott prefers to say Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical , because in this way you can create a picture or a map of things by seeing the light coming from several points around you .
this is different in sounds .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that particularly mean a lot to you :
about your child &apos;s face .
instead we listen to certain features like pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to make the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now just Alice is talking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob is interrup@@ ting her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot;
the same goes for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
with them we cannot create simple images of objects in space .
but by paying attention to changes in the ampli@@ tude and frequency of waves we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speak .
listening to the gravity can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just around : w@@ up@@ p !
if the two bodies are very fast , you hear the same cir@@ cus with an additional tone change . this sounds like : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , engraved in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render sound &#93; No one knows what to listen to , this recognis@@ es as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes each with 30 @-@ fold solar mass that rotate approximately as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s briefly consider what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , orbit a hundred times per second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we have heard it .
therein lies the lasting significance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o eb@@ net is pav@@ ing an entirely new way to explore the universe as never before .
on this path we can listen to the All and hear the invisible .
much in space we can not see -- practical or basically -- not .
a super @-@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . from them we have learned a lot about the universe .
the exciting physical processes are happening in the nucle@@ us , which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through since these op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them because the Big B@@ ang is obsc@@ ured by its own reflection .
through gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back right up to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen , we will never see and of which we have no idea . things we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt that we had not expected .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes like Lig@@ o they are watching are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , age @-@ old bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are , so to speak , the Sau@@ ri@@ k@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different perspective on what happened in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately also how we came out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as bold as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great metal detectors and listen to the cosmos &apos;s noise and cir@@ cus .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago , I tried out an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to which I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot;
do I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
wanted to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing with the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I was afraid of , removed my fear .
my fear of keeping speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a certain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that changed my life deeply , to an unexpected way . it started with a question of my little ones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for un@@ expla@@ in@@ able reasons , &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ating , I need milk for my be@@ ak @-@ cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
from then on , I disturbed myself to always play with them once you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I &apos;m going , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say to play with my children saved my career . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think things out , you aw@@ aken to life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I created television . I produce television .
I do television , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for putting 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are in production at the same time .
every mission offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days , four television programs , 70 hours TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes that are simultaneously in production , times four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal@@ ous , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series run one after the other on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I created myself , and not just produced , so on top of it . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours TV , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who else does it ?
no one , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you that all of you who work so hard , whether you are managing a company , a country or a class@@ room , take a business or a household , take me seriously when I talk about work , so that you understand that I don &apos;t just mess around on the computer and fancy , and it &apos;s true when I say : I don &apos;t understand that a dream job is not about dreams .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , everything reality , everything blood , sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m deep@@ ened into the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
it is as if I stopped troops when I painted on a canvas .
as if one had a high tone , ran a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
she is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mother@@ ly , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the bu@@ zz .
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy street , I could go on it forever .
many people accept when I explain to them the sums that I &apos;m talking about writing that writing is fun for me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does it .
but the h@@ um -- when I began to work and work and work , build , create and collaborate , I discovered this thing , this hum@@ ming , this energy . the sums !
the sums are more than writing .
bu@@ zz@@ ing is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you can &apos;t strive to be different from size .
the feeling of not being able to asp@@ ire to size , no matter what price .
this is called bu@@ zz@@ ing .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it &apos;s called genius .
perhaps ego is called ego .
perhaps it &apos;s the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I just know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I just know that I love the tot@@ tering .
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it .
in order to make it clear : the more successful I will , the more episodes , the more work there is , the more work there is , the more things are happening , the more I write history , the more expectations there is .
the more I work to be successful , the more I need to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the Marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay , the tot@@ als , the tot@@ als , the tot@@ als .
I like this sum . I love the sums .
I need the sums . I am the h@@ um .
am I just this hum@@ ming ?
and then the tot@@ tering stopped .
revised , over@@ stressed , exagger@@ ated , burned out .
the bu@@ zz stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that her m@@ um is a single stit@@ ch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my mo@@ m won &apos;t be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ stim@@ ate , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the hum@@ ming ceased .
the sums of the engine were spe@@ ech@@ less .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was out .
the sums did not come back .
my sums were broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ anic work , 15 hours @-@ long , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ating , a Titan does not sleep , does not give up , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a showcase @-@ titanium ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the h@@ um and the sums I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hypo@@ c@@ rites , stupid author @-@ titanium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re working to be a teacher , being a ban@@ ker , being a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love someone else and that gives you the bu@@ zz when you know the sums already when the bu@@ zz stops , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no , when two things become aware of me :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I must say yes to all and secondly , it didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ating &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she calls no one any more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did that happen ?
I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and my bu@@ zz@@ ing sh@@ rou@@ ds , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
nothing special about that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in soli@@ tude and lack of money , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out .
I am focused .
I &apos;m quiet .
the land I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl is releasing into &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door opens and an energy rush comes in .
and that not immediately , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing slowly returns .
no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sums , but a sum .
and now I feel like I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stick to the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no secret . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sums , the working sum , the titanium dioxide , this is just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am when I describe myself with the help of broad@@ casts and TV lessons and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
bu@@ zz@@ ing is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on love .
the bu@@ zz is the stream that comes from the z@@ est of life .
the real bu@@ zz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real bu@@ zz ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be accomplished , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which god told me that I am a Titan ?
it is simply love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from all guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice , if I want to hear the sum@@ ming again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
I don &apos;t seem to play in such a way as to work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at the workplace as at home .
this admission is painful , because what a person prefers to be at home ?
well , I know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
we are racing around in the garden , in front of and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
I mostly feel stiff , absent and pu@@ zz@@ led .
I always grab my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live , and the hum@@ ming of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also do it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you keep me nai@@ ve for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something different .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
and when my teen@@ age daughter talks to me for 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year .
it &apos;s just 15 minutes , more need@@ n &apos;t need it .
each can bring 15 minutes on the piece , even on a bad day of whi@@ m !
15 minutes on the track !
no mobile phone , no clothes , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to pray .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my fe@@ el@@ iness , my world . they don &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the bu@@ zz , have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; games &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you &apos;re doing well .
find out and preserve it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I win . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training when I wanted to exceed myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on the piece , why not treat yourself to 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong with it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz@@ ing came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz@@ ing seems to come back when I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself again in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the sums , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sums , the sums are not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my sum now .
the tot@@ tering of life .
the tot@@ tering of love .
the bu@@ zz of work is part of me , but only a part . and I am so grateful for that .
it &apos;s up to me that I &apos;m a Titan . I have never seen a Titan who plays travel to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the country I am creating , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high clay , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the other , the right bu@@ zz : the tot@@ ality of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , lasting , bare and new feeling of life is growing in me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly that h@@ um , the more I know who I am .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things out , I &apos;m raising you to life .
this belongs to the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans don &apos;t have a chance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to deal with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent disability .
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures .
they certainly have one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; an electro@@ de is im@@ planted in the brain in order to influence the switching circles of the neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function improves .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease suffering from severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the recovery of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was senior doctor and worked day and night in emergency .
I often provided patients with a skull @-@ brain trauma .
they have to imagine that in skull @-@ brain trauma the brain sw@@ ells and the skull pressure increases .
in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull .
to do this , sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to let cells grow from a tissue piece is similar to very small children who are taken out of their families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and surroundings to thri@@ ve .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts Jean @-@ François managed it .
he saw this under his microscope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you know from biology classes that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they split very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the folding of the brain .
but why don &apos;t they get us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain as we find them in higher concentrations of brain injuries .
but this is not so certain .
one thing is clear , however -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass out of the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then mark them in color to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we re @-@ im@@ planted them at the reception point of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we are re @-@ im@@ porting these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we are using the same cells in fo@@ amed brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario , we im@@ planted the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that they disappeared completely after a few weeks as if they had been removed , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not used there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added a violation and re @-@ im@@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew into mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been reim@@ planted .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells that we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture .
of course we couldn &apos;t stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take feed pellets of a tray .
they did that very well .
when they reached a stable level of dex@@ ter@@ ity , we injured the motor @-@ motor range in the motor cor@@ tex .
after that , the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could not move their hand any more .
just as it would happen in people , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic cereb@@ ral mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like the monkey .
when we were certain that the ape had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells .
on the left side they see the monkey , who recovered spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now see when we reim@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after plantation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream still is to im@@ itate it in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think , &quot; I know someone who can need that . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials in humans .
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , one has to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , and so on .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then one has to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose the patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply it to a multi@@ center study .
you must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to look at them as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it really is , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as an imm@@ utable entity .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact democracy d@@ wind@@ les with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally explained to me as Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not affect the austerity programs that were realized in Greece .
at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if it were to change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro Group are mistaken , we could save us democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy , our societies will become more ble@@ ak , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are wasted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the topic of waste I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the twin @-@ summit parad@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt that casts his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which belongs to wealthy depos@@ itors and corporations , who are too anxious to invest there where it would be productive and income to produce the debt that humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months , in the USA , in England and in the euro@@ zone , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars have been invested in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , rail , equipment and so on and so forth .
3.@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sound after a lot of money until one compar@@ es it to the 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time circul@@ ated in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate the stock exchanges and raise the real estate prices .
thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks which are not equ@@ alled by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year olds in the U.S. , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand , which , like in an endless loop , boo@@ sts the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which , like in an endless loop , could boost the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors in which they do not invest .
un@@ intentionally causes the circumstances that cause o@@ il@@ pus to kill him .
this is my coat with capitalism --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to further develop human talents and especially to finance all the technologies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we proceed , what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course , closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on the basis of these exclu@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive thing about the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it involved the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they allowed them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same voice weigh@@ ting in questions of the state che@@ ek .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last for a long time --
like a candle , which shines very bright , it is also quickly burned out .
however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers .
for the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- the world of the corporations -- became a democratic zone .
in our present demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , there was a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two , by gradually under@@ mining politics and ex@@ propri@@ ating it .
are you wondering why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not part of a degeneration of its DNA .
it is because nowadays it is possible to be in the government and still not in power , because the power is diver@@ ted from politics into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , which so sustain@@ ably decim@@ ated the animals from which they feed , that they end up star@@ ving at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that has so far can@@ ni@@ ated politics that it hur@@ ts itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , the inequality increases , the general economic demand falls and the managers of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demos &quot; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we must re@@ unite politics and economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; keep control , as in ancient Athens , apart from exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Mar@@ xi@@ an Left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : to aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism is doing it by replacing low @-@ wage workers with automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the extravag@@ ance subli@@ me , and social conflicts more deeply , just like it -- already very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
so we must re@@ structure the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re@@ united area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear as a documentation .
so the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements he has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; matrix &quot; or by something similar to the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines serve the people and the people put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ian &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long conversations with the meaning of life .
I think we should be optimistic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; like utop@@ ia rather than the &quot; Matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples .
in the business sector , please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next , from one firm to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all revenues from capital and revenues arise and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work in it , and employees working there where the company does not belong . no more exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no up@@ lifting twin peaks .
in the area of global political economy , please note that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest Emerging Markets &#93; , in the interests of all mankind .
suppose the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- let us call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; into entities of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time you did not have the technical means to implement it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have them , especially against the backdrop of a re@@ united policy and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world I describe to you is at the same time a Liber@@ al , in which they prefer privileged individuals , and Marxist , because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the tr@@ ash of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all , it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide politically together .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani writes : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liberal Marx@@ ists in your biography itself .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economics is ... Do we not do that , technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers describes as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we see it up @-@ to @-@ date , it will not only destabili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is small .
if this analysis is applicable , then Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Ha@@ ye@@ k , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am completely confused .
BG : in fact , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said that . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you think from the West &apos;s point of view on China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
we have the appearance of democracy in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies .
as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays - the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in a sense , if I can say so pro@@ voc@@ atively , China today resembles the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als like John Stu@@ art Mill
he was particularly scep@@ tical concerning democratic development .
what one can now observe in China resembles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the 19th century , smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I suspected that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later in the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing , because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to say good @-@ bye to compl@@ ac@@ ency and ongoing denial that a massive fault line went through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which by the way , was the first suggestion that revealed this denial .
unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro Group , have continued to choose the denial .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to get an economic system that is not viable by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you anticipate ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : everyday .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ...
if there is a finance minister or any minister who , after 6 months in office , particularly in such a ten@@ se situation , claims he has made no mistake , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the part of the financi@@ ers to find a common solution .
but that didn &apos;t exist .
they only wanted to bring our government down , only because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that were going on through the euro@@ zone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit that for 5 years they had been a disa@@ strous program in Greece .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is worse than during &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika who imposed this policy on us admitted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for if they do not survive , the fre@@ est@@ anding centri@@ fu@@ ges will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , according to which it seems to me , it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
many have never heard of Roy Price even though he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy has met three years ago .
Roy Price is an employee at Amazon Studio ,
the Amazon TV production company .
he is 47 years old , slim , has a refresh@@ ment and refers to Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy does not have any choice .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right of this curve .
this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows this review will receive .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire , &quot; all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where , after a season has looked , your brain asks : &quot; where are more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough about what &apos;s going on at this end of the turn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to prohi@@ bit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the average cul@@ mination , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire .
so he must make sure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing something like that , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create success .
he needs guaranteed success so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents them online , where everyone can watch for free .
and if Amazon doesn &apos;t get things out for free , it &apos;s up to you , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
but they do not know that they are watched when watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything .
you capture when you start the show when you pause , what parts one ski@@ ps or looks over again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them , and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com about four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many people can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this turn is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a little different .
instead of staging a contest , he and his team watched the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x Viewer , so the reviews that they give the shows their course , which shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together , they took a venture and decided not to make a Sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , the question is : what has happened here ?
it has two very competitive , data @-@ sealed companies .
they connect these many data to each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow says that it should work with everything .
when you collect millions of data for a decision you make , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
you optimize it with very powerful computers .
the minimum thing you can expect is good television , right ?
if data analysis does not work this way , this is something frigh@@ tening , because we live in a time where we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television .
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems here ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes into contact with this software in this room . come into contact with it , you are in jail .
if someone is in jail in the U.S. and asks for discharge , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether or not it is released .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will decide whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . that &apos;s not because a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
the data of the most experienced companies is also incorrect .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that , through data analysis out@@ bur@@ sts of flu , the bad way , they can predict -- through data analysis of Google searches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ minated in a publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it worked fine , year around year , until suddenly it didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it simply didn &apos;t work , this again was a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data of the most experienced companies , such as Amazon and Google , sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data flows into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in the enforcement of law , in medicine .
so we should make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and un@@ successful decisions . this pattern should be propag@@ ated .
if you have to solve a complex problem , mainly do two things :
first , dis@@ assemble this problem in its individual parts so that you can analyse the items ; as a second , put the items together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ assemble a problem and to understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re@@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is a different tool for this and we have it all : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to re@@ assemble parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete , in order to get a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I believe Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have not been capable of . but deciding how to take all these parts together again and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; is not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions first when they were competing for TV ideas , then they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is what the data tells us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe things are going wrong when data begin to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you only have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will challenge it later with a technical demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball in retro@@ sp@@ ect .
but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with a much more sophisticated approach , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball will be smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data , it still pays off to make decisions , to be an expert in what one does and risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
