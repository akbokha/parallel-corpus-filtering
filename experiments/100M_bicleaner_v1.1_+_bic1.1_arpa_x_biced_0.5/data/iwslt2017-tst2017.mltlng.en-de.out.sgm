<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone had heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA had illegally heard phones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a disastrous U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA surrendered to Iran literally drafts for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has investigated risks and called upon him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol for the pattern of the government to condemn whistleblower and spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the needy who reveal it.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many brave reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "suddenly, although they have been saying for years that it would be essential for their case, the government's demands were dropped." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the era of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can always hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of shutting and splitting up, it could also do his digital Footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, hid his telephone references secretly,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and bank information, his return, and even travel tips with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and risens supposed source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblower, but instead, the judiciary condemned more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article about national security has been the result of a whistleblower going to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first Constituent Assembly because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology allows the government to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">They can do that from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there are communication software that didn't exist when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblowers, originally developed by the internet site of Aaron's Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, in which I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news website, like the here of the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server where only the relevant news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot obtain more information secretly, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that endanger all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it is important to ensure that not only technological men such as Edward Snowden have a chance to get rid of misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower," ""</seg>
<seg id="39">Or a Wall Street insider, who warns us of the next financial crisis, warns about abuses in the supply of soldiers. or the nearest environment agent who alerts alert to the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wall Street insider who warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016 the biggest data leck of history has been published.] [the Panama Papers reveal that rich and mighty] [We have been asking Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] This week we were asked about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has letterbox offices in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a track of $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others waiting nervously for the next release, and on the next disclosed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the Plot of an agent or a John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems crying away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this happen to us?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">All over the world media and leading politicians, like secret tax havens, are used by a few to hide and obscure their fortunes -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine a Matryoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these illicit.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there have so far been no prominent Americans who came forward in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it's not that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But due to the principle that these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leck from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some US states you need less information, you need to provide less information to create a company than to obtain a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">Fraudsters have allowed scammers to rip off particularly vulnerable jetties.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks like.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does this work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 bar firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked the fact that all except one lawyer made proposals to our investigators how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers approached us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anyone. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covert investigators.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "it's not about a single top politician, involved in a scandal." ""</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And in order to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very dull as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing had ever changed, as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see quite a lot of things started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "over the past few years we have seen more transparency as far as the owners of companies are concerned." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">"" "" "" "since then, the EU has been collecting key governance at a national level, who really is behind firms in Europe and who controls them." ""</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA hinders here.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have tabled a bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see this Panama-Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headlamps.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy to get up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this kind of intransparency by laws." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together we can finally end the intransparency that is now enabling this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a sale of the farm.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed standing and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip across the country. after that he would go to the Peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where are you sleeping tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What am I doing now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the Peace Corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to get kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazda!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small luggage compartment!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard me say," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "one voice in my head said," "" "uh, please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">"" "at night I lay in bed, I gazed at the ceiling and thought," "" "Oh man! what did I get in there?" ""</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "what if he's crazy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of bed, sneezing on toe tips to the door, and shut my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Maybe the people who were sold to me when I was a stranger were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress with.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost bankrupt, my roommate is pulling out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it, transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could earn something. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, plus a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air mattresses and breakfast" [AIRB and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on the wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham omelettes tasted completely different because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured all the city with them. when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I started.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that at the same time we were able to find new friends and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things were rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if this could be a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented to investors: "we want to create a website where people publish publicly pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors are closed when visitors come by.</seg>
<seg id="139">Through the internet, they can then invite other people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the rocket to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not act.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all learned that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If one has a problem, one observes the things that one can do well. we were able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Art, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we were striving for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hands.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile phone to your left sitting-neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent flight of panic that you are now feeling -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can't only read your SMS, they can see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most people feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who's actually Al Gores's mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is candidate for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up. I want to tell you about some of the discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first imagined his name; if he had told where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine that you would have 150 assessments, all of which say, "He can really get hold of very well-designed cell phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well thought-out feedback system significantly strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to leave negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally, we decided to wait until both host and guest left their assessments before we set them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are regarding age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Not surprisingly we trust people most, who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting if you add a person's call -- in our case by judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have fewer than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">"" "" "" "a good reputation is common." ""</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">We also learned that trust is dependent on how much money is available.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little how, for example," "" "Hi!" "" "you won't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "if you tell too much, for example," "" "I have problems with my mother -- -- the request isn't accepted either." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, such as "Great works of art in your apartment! I'm making holidays with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to create this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on how to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we didn't reckon was the great amount of people who were more than willing to put down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">Three things can be recognized.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Thirdly, a need which had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">Business is very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have been partying unallowed parties or have ravaged apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have left guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood on the front line when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than those calls. it hurts when I only think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction of 123 million overnight stays had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people are in accordance with each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, something wonderful can emerge.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers who tend to have heart attacks because of sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are true guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know one.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital if you die and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want people to feel lonely they pass books.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can stay longer without charge of extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course not every stay runs off.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure monetary transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions work together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a matter of economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but now it is simply" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing is not fair." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">"" "" "" "share Economy" "" "describes a trade which promises human relationships." ""</seg>
<seg id="229">People place a part of themselves openly, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, it is easy to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if trips were a rich buffet made of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at every place one visits, a group of residents would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one in a pub-turpentine neighborhood of which one has never heard of;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from the ground up to each other?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of sharing one's share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that enable us society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">This project has already begun in South Korea's capital Seoul. many parking spaces owned by the government have already begun.</seg>
<seg id="240">Have been offered to residents. students who were looking for a lead,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were taught to people whose children were educated, and incubate programmes were launched,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was also a warm hospitality before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There have been similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why exactly did our work work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think that's amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda drives past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design can't solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this big impact, I wonder what we can use in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study found that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>

<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America more secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a few parking spaces, but not stopping the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visits to a mosque leads to a more tolerant approach to people of other faiths, and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as I told me a leader of the police in the Washington DC area, DC recently told me: people are actually not being radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the process of radicalisation it has been found that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their church, even from their family, so that the extremist group may have a brainwashing which causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or disliked by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we have to stop people going to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS bases its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, I think we need to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would fit into their imaginations by recognising them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology based on their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but when you look at them, they don't do what they read in their" "" "Holy Scriptures." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was just the opposite. every minister with whom she spoke, she silenced and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing, and something that would have made sense to her anger, she was a main target for the instrumentalization of extremists who promised her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam re-established the connection with God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing her for her anger, he showed her constructive ways of real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque was to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how the Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear we pass at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study reveals that when people submit messages that have been reported negatively about Muslims, they are more likely to have military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you are looking at the time when the Muslims' mood shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I have expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">"" "" "" "it can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to undermine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens." ""</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>

<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.</seg>

<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and it was not an easy decision for us, because it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat, we drove through silence, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, pulled out my shoes, went to the prayer hall, and what I saw let me pause.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assembly was Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment, I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courageously and prejudiced their courage and compassion.</seg>

<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about becoming a billionaire business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research facilities worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air package delivery reached our social awareness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRAC Centre in France built a six-metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. a few years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting to each other, flying machines achieve high speed and acceleration in the tightest of spaces.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-winding structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, deal with turbulence and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to exceed the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to work autonomously, it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, an offshoot of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Every flying machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available at the highest level. e. g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying machine trying to hit two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in advance, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">Unlike most starters, it can float, and has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulences like wind arches.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight unit will be able to regain the optimum position and improve performance by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that advance at the heart of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with thousands of movable parts coming together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft, which had only two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying is working with just one.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote controlled aircraft. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">There is only one moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and cross rudder, no other actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, there is so much happening in the inner life so that it can fly stable and move in space everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="440">However, it does not have the elegant tail switch algorithm. to get it flying, I have to throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability of throwing it right, if everyone is watching me is small, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the performer is an exercise in intimidity, this machine is here, the Omnihead with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, he receives the extraordinary capacity,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter which direction it is rotated or even rotated.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers among the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some are available in models, the rest is learned directly at flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's take a look at this.</seg>
<seg id="451">If flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate twin propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counter-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When assembling them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, if something goes wrong -- an engine or propeller fails, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further if also restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-quadcopters -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where it is in the room and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe press on the other hand would like to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, wages are in development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that there are creative, clever creatures allowed to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">At 1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled around each other in a very far distant galaxy, turning the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">These short moments they lit more brightly than all stars in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not use their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us first arrange the events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">More than 1.3 billion years ago, there was just a multi-cell life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the Earth has produced quite a few: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God help us -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly brave -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector in order to search for gravitational waves, which are caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, design and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the Laser-Interferometer Gravity Wave-Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up period, the precision of Ligo increased significantly, which improved the detection performance enormously.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">In early September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes passed through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, these were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves from black holes and their observatories, like Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A wave of gravity is a ripple in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the wave, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and stout into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustration, lecturers often perform an upright dance in courses relating to the theory of relativity.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and stow, stretch and stow."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched and stowed upon arrival of the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by 1. therefore, one explained the Ligo-workers for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured at less than one thousandth of the radius of a nuclear nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the chase after the waves as follows:" "" "the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public certainly all obstacles will be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne released this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott prefers to say Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because in this way you can create a picture or a map of things by seeing the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">This is different in sounds.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that particularly mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">About your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain features like pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to make the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now just Alice is talking." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob is interrupting her." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same goes for gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">With them we cannot create simple images of objects in space.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of waves we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe speak.</seg>
<seg id="522">Listening to the gravity can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just around: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">If the two bodies are very fast, you hear the same circus with an additional tone change. this sounds like: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, engraved in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrender sound] No one knows what to listen to, this recognises as sound of -- SH:... two black holes each with 30-fold solar mass that rotate approximately as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's briefly consider what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, orbit a hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the lasting significance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo ebnet is paving an entirely new way to explore the universe as never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the All and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can not see -- practical or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A super-nova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes are happening in the nucleus, which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through since these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them because the Big Bang is obscured by its own reflection.</seg>
<seg id="541">Through gravitational waves it should be possible to look back right up to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, we will never see and of which we have no idea. things we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt that we had not expected.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this subject: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes like Ligo they are watching are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, age-old bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak, the Sauriknochen for our archaeological work.</seg>

<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I was afraid of, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of keeping speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, gone.</seg>

<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I created television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I do television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for putting 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are in production at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="588">Every mission offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days, four television programs, 70 hours TV, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programmes that are simultaneously in production, times four, 16 episodes: scandalous, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run one after the other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I created myself, and not just produced, so on top of it. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the camp fire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours TV, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else does it?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, that's why I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I say it because I know what you think when the word" "" "author" "" "falls." ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work so hard, whether you are managing a company, a country or a classroom, take a business or a household, take me seriously when I talk about work, so that you understand that I don't just mess around on the computer and fancy, and it's true when I say: I don't understand that a dream job is not about dreams.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, everything reality, everything blood, sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm deepened into the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I stopped troops when I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As if one had a high tone, ran a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and motherly, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy street, I could go on it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I explain to them the sums that I'm talking about writing that writing is fun for me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, it does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the hum -- when I began to work and work and work, build, create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this humming, this energy. the sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums are more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">Buzzing is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz, then you can't strive to be different from size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being able to aspire to size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it's called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps ego is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it's the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know that I'm not made for failure, and I just know that I love the tottering.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know that I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">In order to make it clear: the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more work there is, the more work there is, the more things are happening, the more I write history, the more expectations there is.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I need to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the Marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high clay, the totals, the totals, the totals.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sum. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the hum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this humming?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the tottering stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overstressed, exaggerated, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that her mum is a single stitch.</seg>
<seg id="644">"" "Harper tells people:" "" "my mom won't be there, but you can write my nanny." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says," "" "Estimate, I want to go to Shonda-Land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">These are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1, when the humming ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine were speechless.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job any more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums were broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titanic work, 15 hours-long, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegating, a Titan does not sleep, does not give up, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a showcase-titanium,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the hum and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade away?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "hypocrites, stupid author-titanium." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you're doing it, you're doing it, you're working to be a teacher, being a banker, being a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love someone else and that gives you the buzz when you know the sums already when the buzz stops, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern state waitress" "" "asks me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I'm on the way out, late and she says," "" "Mom, do you like playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no, when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "first, I must say yes to all and secondly, it didn't call me" "" "estimating" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she calls no one any more" "" "estimation" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I'm Titan and my buzzing shrouds, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mum, do you like playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">Nothing special about that.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" "" "Everybody Poops" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in solitude and lack of money, I can't do anything except to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I'm quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl is releasing into "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door opens and an energy rush comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that not immediately, but it happens, it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzzing slowly returns.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sum.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stick to the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No secret. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the working sum, the titanium dioxide, this is just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am when I describe myself with the help of broadcasts and TV lessons and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">Buzzing is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the stream that comes from the zest of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real buzz is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real buzz ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be accomplished, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for which god told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from all guilt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice, if I want to hear the summing again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">I don't seem to play in such a way as to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at the workplace as at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what a person prefers to be at home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I know.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "honestly, I call myself" "" "Titan" "" "--" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>

<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I mostly feel stiff, absent and puzzled.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always grab my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the humming of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also do it! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you keep me naive for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You're right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybug or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And when my teenage daughter talks to me for 15 minutes, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It's just 15 minutes, more needn't need it.</seg>

<seg id="753">15 minutes on the track!</seg>

<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to pray.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my feeliness, my world. they don't have to be the children. it is important to feel the buzz, have a place for peace of mind.</seg>

<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself again in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>

<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to deal with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">They certainly have one of the most well-known, the "deep brain stimulation." an electrode is implanted in the brain in order to influence the switching circles of the neurons in such a way that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease suffering from severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was senior doctor and worked day and night in emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often provided patients with a skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that in skull-brain trauma the brain swells and the skull pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">To do this, sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To let cells grow from a tissue piece is similar to very small children who are taken out of their families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and surroundings to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts Jean-François managed it.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you know from biology classes that stem cells are immature cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they split very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why don't they get us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain as we find them in higher concentrations of brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear, however -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass out of the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we re-implanted them at the reception point of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we are re-importing these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we are using the same cells in foamed brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we implanted the cells in a healthy brain, and we observed that they disappeared completely after a few weeks as if they had been removed, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not used there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added a violation and re-implanted exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew into mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells that we dye in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we couldn't stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets of a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did that very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable level of dexterity, we injured the motor-motor range in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">After that, the monkeys were paralysed, they could not move their hand any more.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in people, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic cerebral mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the ape had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side they see the monkey, who recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we reimplanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after plantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream still is to imitate it in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon, how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think, "I know someone who can need that."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials in humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results, one has to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then one has to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to choose the patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply it to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to look at them as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it really is, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as an immutable entity.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact democracy dwindles with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally explained to me as Minister of Finance in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not affect the austerity programs that were realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rebellious friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would be abolished if it were to change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Euro Group are mistaken, we could save us democracy, but that we need a true and defenceless democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">"" "" "" "for without democracy, our societies will become more bleak, our future gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted." ""</seg>
<seg id="914">On the topic of waste I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the twin-summit paradox." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt that casts his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to wealthy depositors and corporations, who are too anxious to invest there where it would be productive and income to produce the debt that humanity urgently needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months, in the USA, in England and in the eurozone, 3,4 trillion US dollars have been invested in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, rail, equipment and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars sound after a lot of money until one compares it to the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time circulated in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing to inflate the stock exchanges and raise the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks which are not equalled by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year olds in the U.S., Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand, which, like in an endless loop, boosts the pessimism of investors, which, like in an endless loop, could boost the pessimism of investors in which they do not invest.</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally causes the circumstances that cause oilpus to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my coat with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"" "" "" "all unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to further develop human talents and especially to finance all the technologies," "" "green" "" "technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth." ""</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we proceed, what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy, of course, closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">"" "" "" "however, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Athenian democracy on the basis of these exclusions." ""</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive thing about the Athenian democracy was and is that it involved the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they allowed them the right to political co-determination with the same voice weighting in questions of the state cheek.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not last for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, which shines very bright, it is also quickly burned out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our liberal democracies have not their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While Athenian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- the world of the corporations -- became a democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, there was a relentless struggle between the two, by gradually undermining politics and expropriating it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not part of a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because nowadays it is possible to be in the government and still not in power, because the power is diverted from politics into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of carnivores, which so sustainably decimated the animals from which they feed, that they end up starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy that has so far canniated politics that it hurts itself through the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations is growing, political goods are devalued, the inequality increases, the general economic demand falls and the managers of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives the "demos" out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we must reunite politics and economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keep control, as in ancient Athens, apart from exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxian Left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism is doing it by replacing low-wage workers with automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the extravagance sublime, and social conflicts more deeply, just like it -- already very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we must restructure the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure we are democratizing the reunited area, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy which makes the film "Matrix" appear as a documentation.</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements he has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in "matrix" or by something similar to the society in "Star Trek," in which machines serve the people and the people put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenian "Agora," in long conversations with the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we should be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" like utopia rather than the "Matrix" similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the business sector, please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next, from one firm to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all revenues from capital and revenues arise and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work in it, and employees working there where the company does not belong. no more exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no uplifting twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy, please note that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest Emerging Markets], in the interests of all mankind.</seg>
<seg id="966">Suppose the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- let us call it "the cosmos," into entities of "cosmos" -- and each government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time you did not have the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"" "" "" "today we have them, especially against the backdrop of a reunited policy and economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is at the same time a Liberal, in which they prefer privileged individuals, and Marxist, because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the trash of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world?</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide politically together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani writes: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as liberal Marxists in your biography itself.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economics is... Do we not do that, technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers describes as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we see it up-to-date, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is small.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is applicable, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am completely confused.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: in fact, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said that. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you think from the West's point of view on China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">We have the appearance of democracy in our liberal democracies.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays - the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a sense, if I can say so provocatively, China today resembles the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals like John Stuart Mill</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical concerning democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What one can now observe in China resembles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now proposing to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I suspected that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later in the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "to say good-bye to complacency and ongoing denial that a massive fault line went through the eurozone, and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the entire European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which by the way, was the first suggestion that revealed this denial.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the Euro Group, have continued to choose the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to get an economic system that is not viable by political will and authoritarianism, you might be able to delay it for a while, but when the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you anticipate?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: everyday.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister or any minister who, after 6 months in office, particularly in such a tense situation, claims he has made no mistake, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the part of the financiers to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that didn't exist.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They only wanted to bring our government down, only because they did not want to deal with the distortions that were going on through the eurozone.</seg>

<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Many have never heard of Roy Price even though he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy has met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is an employee at Amazon Studio,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The Amazon TV production company.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has a refreshment and refers to Twitter as "Movies, TV, Technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy does not have any choice.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are on the right of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows this review will receive.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire, "all the shows that are addictive, where, after a season has looked, your brain asks:" where are more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left side, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough about what's going on at this end of the turn.</seg>
<seg id="1055">"" "Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to prohibit" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the average culmination, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it's the first time that Amazon is doing something like that, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents them online, where everyone can watch for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon doesn't get things out for free, it's up to you, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">But they do not know that they are watched when watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show when you pause, what parts one skips or looks over again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process them, and this results in the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a Sitcom about four Republican US senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many people can remember this show because it wasn't that good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this turn is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a little different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of staging a contest, he and his team watched the existing data on the Netflix Viewer, so the reviews that they give the shows their course, which shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they took a venture and decided not to make a Sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"" "" "" "house of Cards" "" "gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go." ""</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what has happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">It has two very competitive, data-sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data to each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow says that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">When you collect millions of data for a decision you make, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimize it with very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The minimum thing you can expect is good television, right?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work this way, this is something frightening, because we live in a time where we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems here?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes into contact with this software in this room. come into contact with it, you are in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail in the U.S. and asks for discharge, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether or not it is released.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will decide whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. that's not because a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of the most experienced companies is also incorrect.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that, through data analysis outbursts of flu, the bad way, they can predict -- through data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">"" "it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine" "" "Nature." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year around year, until suddenly it didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply didn't work, this again was a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of the most experienced companies, such as Amazon and Google, sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data flows into decisions of life -- at the workplace, in the enforcement of law, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and unsuccessful decisions. this pattern should be propagated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, disassemble this problem in its individual parts so that you can analyse the items; as a second, put the items together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to disassemble a problem and to understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to reassemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is a different tool for this and we have it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to reassemble parts and pieces, even if the information is incomplete, in order to get a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I believe Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have not been capable of. but deciding how to take all these parts together again and make a show like "House of Cards" is not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions first when they were competing for TV ideas, then they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say," "" "This is what the data tells us." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe things are going wrong when data begin to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question you only have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will challenge it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball in retrospect.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it with a much more sophisticated approach, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball will be smarter and smarter. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data, it still pays off to make decisions, to be an expert in what one does and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
