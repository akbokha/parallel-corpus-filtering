Munich, 1856: four cards that change your view of the city
An asylum institution, where young people are supposed to meet.
A pit chapel, where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Farmers cultivate the former cause of farmers.
The oldest official card coin boosts exciting stories.
It is annoying if maps are not up-to-date.
Everyone who had to get upset because the Navi was showing a green meadow instead of a bypass road.
The historic maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bavarian State Government, are anything but up-to-date - but precisely therefore very enlightening.
Especially when comparing them with current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how towns and communities have changed in the area of circulation of Munich's Merkur since the 19th century.
The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a patchwork that is not immediately recognizable as such.
For towns and municipalities, detailed maps, so-called elemental sheets, have been incorporated into the large overview map.
These were created according to the Bavarian Association of Surveying between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic record of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801: it was the present-day neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern card.
Elector Max IV. Joseph continued the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau," and thus the Bavarian surveying management.
The information leaflet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is to be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek (Bavarian State Library).
The comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
One example is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. in 1877, as a Munich suburb.
Today, Untersendling lies in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-written numbered flute pieces from the so-called "Ursus" from which the basic tax was derived.
Small parcels show no farmers there today - but gardeners of the plant "Land in Sun."
A large green area is located north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the October test, was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.
On the other hand of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
"" "in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "" "on the Gasteig" "" "or from the hill" "" "On the air" "" "- but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt "" "." "" "
Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with delusions.
"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich district Irrenanstalt" "" "On the Auer Lüften" "" "was created." ""
From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the establishment - that psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended with the chains of so-called" "" "Irish" "". "" ""
He also prohibited the personnel from using violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum of Haidhausen, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.
There was room for 280 patients, later it was extended to 500 seats.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisepower plant in Haar in 1905.
The Isar-Amper-Klinikum in Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been located there since 2006.
Young people in the Munich Salesianum meet in the area of the former Auer Badan.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with educational establishments.
West is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the Children's House "Casa Don Bosco" was erected - architecturally based on the original construction of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids.
"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "Main Square" "" "around 1856, the Kaufinger Street was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""
The Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs broke many holes in the city centre in December 1944.
A big one remained until today - at Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a chapel chapel dating back to the Middle Ages, once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn commuter route takes place.
With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.
Civil rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the promotion of coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"" "" "" "the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which will enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls for Afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when travelling through the state, as a number of dubious, racial-based incidents occur throughout the state and are noted here," "" "said the Group's opinion." ""
A recent law of Missouri, which makes people more difficult to accuse discrimination, as well as the prosecuting authorities of the state, which are disproportionately aimed at minorities, prompted the group to issue travel warnings, said the NAACP.
"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed, "said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in dignified circumstances at the beginning of the year, after having no fuel at all during the voyage and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
"" "" "" "the Council also points to a recent report by Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black motorists in the state will be 75 percent more common than whites." ""
"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""
"" "" "" "people need to be willing to bring in deposit money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI report program, which classifies the state with regard to the number of injuries to the 16th rank of the country.
The warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult to accuse a company because of housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the States adopted immigration laws that bind local law enforcement agencies to arrest people because of immigration violations, which will contribute to further race profile in view of ACLU.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently, interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Fence project is elementary
The Fischbacher Weidewatering project is a successful project and will continue next year.
The CDU members of Parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac gave a picture on the spot.
In the right-hand courtyard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the fishing company CDU met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.
Markus Schwendemann first provided insights into his farm, where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 milk cows and as many young kittens and accommodates in five apartments holiday-branches.
"" "the" "" "black-white milk" "" "is the alternative marketing path for him for the milk of his cows," "" "Schwendemann" "". "" ""
On the table of the Feriengaeste comes exclusively regional.
"" "as he is also chairman of Fischerbach, he described the electric fence as" "" "essential" "". "" ""
I cannot profitably manage on such steep surfaces.
The green area care for a lot of work, much needs to be done with the brushcutter.
"" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," "" "said Schwendemann." ""
In 2003, he took over the parent company and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even though he did not conduct bio-operations.
"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "" "the Commune recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about the" "" "Leader" "" "promotion." "" "" ""
At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that the afforestation of the land could be extended for quite a while.
"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have are those people who work in agriculture and think about how they can continue their operation," "" "the mayor emphasised." ""
Farmers are often criticised for funding
A total of 25 plots were fenced in 2013 by eleven participants.
The open-up area thus amounts to 40 hectares, which may not be forested until at least 2023.
From the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was promoted over leaders, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischbach.
Thus the farmer stayed 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 km of pasture-fence.
"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and rural women."
Peter Weiss was also convinced: "here, the best foods are produced."
The Landscape Conservation Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state-run promotion of pasture-fences.
The aim is the disclosure of the Black Forest.
The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be smuggable (inclination above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
The application of eight participants with 24 pitches, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence, is currently running for the Fisherbach Weidezauncing Project 2018.
The open-up area is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112,000 euros.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty
The safest sign of regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firenze Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN on the President's suggestions for the drastic limitation of legal migration to the Statue of Liberty.
To stay fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and liberty Imitators would have liked him if he had done it.
But he attacked its meaning, and especially the significance attributed to it, when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after completion of the monument, was added to its base.
When Miller Acosta complained: "I don't want to enter a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.
"" "the poem you refer to is added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""
Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's stirring words, the only ones in which a state not only invites the old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weeds, your poor, and your afflicted masses longing to breathe freely, and the miserable waste of your rich shores."
"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable waste" "" "was better seen on our screens." ""
Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in the USA.
This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict about the significance of America.
Lazarus - and their friends who used to place their words on the basis of their death at the base - knew well that they performed a high political action.
The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicism by presenting the feminine embodiment of freedom in a worn classic image.
Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: mother of Exilantes.
The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from right wing wanted to change it for a long time.
The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty won't invite anyone, but rather an early Neoconservatives who bring the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
"" "the torch should not enlighten the way to the United States." "" "" ""
Limbaugh is quite unusual here.
The meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of view of perception.
Lazarus's great imaginative action was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, miserable, but desperate people after long and often horrible journeys on the deck of ships.
It is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.
And this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch should not light the way, but light the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the United Kingdom Team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the team of Great Britain
"" "the performance director of the UK's athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-piece Scottish contingent in the world championship ader" "" "will make a massive contribution to the team." "" "" ""
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
"" "black believes that" "" "something special develops in Scotland" "" "and the athletics of the UK must learn something from it." ""
"" "" "" "we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out," "" "said Black." ""
"" "" "" "I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done." ""
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the type in the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "
Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butflip - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain by the team.
"Eilidh is rather modest.
"" "their captain's speech was incredible," "" "says Black." ""
"" "" "" "a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated." ""
"" "the passion and the genuine feeling of" "" "Eilidh" "" "were great." "" "" ""
The Commonwealth Silver medal winner, who will compete at the 400 m hurdles at its fifth world championships, says it's "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the UK team.
Scotland's best total number of athletes in the world championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.
"" "the" "" "mid-distance runner" "" "Muir carries on this road and last year set up five British and two European records." ""
It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch for a great season, which included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle recalls her first world championships, when the only other Scotsman was in Team Lee McConnell.
The team captain says that they are "hugely proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots belong not only to the team, but in some cases they will also be involved in medals and finals.
"the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammates had voted for me and chosen me, makes it something very special for me," she added.
"" "" "" "obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team." ""
It just shows how far we have come.
And they are here as well established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podiums.
What is my speech as a captain?
Yes, I think it went well.
I have only indicated that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.
So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from being back at the Olympiastadion.
"" "I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there." "" "" ""
Block Critics via Facebook: do not concern yourself with a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters.
The father of our country knew something of bad news.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers hit him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.
He knocked at the criticism, sure.
But he did not silence his critics.
"" "for in 1783 Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""
That brings me to Maryland, Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him of it at the beginning of this week.
The Governor's staff dismissed the complaint as a frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?."
"it's just Facebook," said many people.
But it is important.
And it is particularly important if it is a type like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary type of heat.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to debutt his hair-less head to chemotherapy on his side.
Hence the blocking of individuals who come to the Governor's side is a public forum that is considered officially and by employees paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the Governor's actions and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the whip online.
The post said with some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profound.
The pastor recited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.
"" "" "" "I commented courteously that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other news," "" "she wrote in the commentary section of the news release" "" "The Post" "". "" ""
"" "" "" "I also do not appreciate this idea, if a number of people take a position on the same subject, they are rather disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""
"" "what the staff of the Governor described as a" "" "concentrated spam attack" "" "would probably call others" "" "intercession" "". "" ""
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
"" "" "" "it is much cleaner than in former times when people have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles or to arrest demonstrators and silence them." ""
But that's exactly what happens digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this issue was Virginia's last week.
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also visited ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
This should not be so difficult.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable port had a similar effect as the internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous scribes suggested to his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Porcio" wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions that criticised his position on the Amity treaty, trade and shipping with Britain overcame his office, according to historical documents collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses belong to the foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts in the Renaissance Club
The former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope to enjoy home comforts during the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian holds the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who last year led to the final round in Archerfield, before he lost against Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the association founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi.

Fewer lung cancers by passive smoking
In the past two decades fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer.
Scientists at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come to this conclusion in a study.
"" "" "" "according to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths can be attributed to passive smoking per year," "" "said Dr. Heiko Becher." ""
As a comparison, he drew up his own study on this issue of 1994.
At that time there were 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking a year in Germany.

In the area of the house connections, the situation is more complicated than suspected, as there is a lot of seamounts in the underground, which is not noted in the plans.
Traffic that continually obstructs construction work represents a major problem for the company's building company Stumpp.
"" "" "" "the driver's ignorance of red lights and barriers is enormous," "" "says Heinze." ""
The road was closed and only the scheduled buses were allowed to go through.

Poverty and Death in the Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
It even rarely uses a pot.
"" "in their wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regent in the unquiet Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually calls a sweet potato - locally called" "" "nota" "" "- directly in the chimney." ""
After half an hour the charred tuber is taken with zealous, unwashed hands and swallowed up.
Degei sits on the clay ground - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, such as washing clothes with murky water from nearby marsh.
A bucket in a homeless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, her fields were not assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course it can be too dangerous to work late: most of the villagers are unemployed, and many are drinking hard, and there are soldiers here.
"nobody dares to run around in the village after 17 o'clock," she says.
It is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was shot in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote in front of the occupation forces.
An existing movement that stirred up the independence of the Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal monitors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua with the independent part of Papua New Guinea that included the eastern part of the island.
The journey includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive with the rental car.
There is no public transport.
The city, with some 19,000 inhabitants, is made up of wooden houses, surrounded by bamboo fences, and from corrugated iron roofs, which have been transformed by rust into various yellowish-brown tones.
Very few Indonesians made their trip here, let alone journalists and practically no foreigner.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans honoured a god named Uga Tamee.
There were also other changes.
"" "" "" "we were not used to wear these clothes," "" "says Degei, pointing to her lively, handwoven turban, her dark shirt and her bright skirt." ""
"" "" "" "in the past we had only leaves on our bodies." "" "" ""
"" "" "" "Papua Indonesia is the poorest province where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst children's mortality and literacy rates in Asia." ""
But it is also Indonesia's Goldland.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grass Hill, owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is located only 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport has mined gold and copper worth 3.1 billion US dollars.
In addition, Papua has assets valued at $78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of misery for the Papua which ensure that Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
An investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid almost 20 million US dollars from local military units and units, including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists more than 500,000 Jews have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army since 1969.
Mass killings in Papuas tribe in the 1970 "s became genocide in accordance with the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"" "" "" "we Will Use All" "" "is reported in a report by the Brisbane Archdiocese from 2016, in which reports on atrocities of the previous year are included, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations." ""
"" "" "" "it is difficult to count the number of victims, as incidents happen every week," "" "says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch." ""
The screws have increased since Papuas resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but the demographic development is changing because Muslim economic migrants are coming from the populated islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warping canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, a mixed vegetables served with peanut sauce.
Local people fight to keep up here.
"" "" "" "the migrants began to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," "" "explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai natives who moved to work in the provincial capital of Jayapura." ""
"" "" "" "the native of Papua - the mom mom [the women] of Papua - cost their market." "" "" ""
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Joko, promised to address inequalities and violations of law in Papua during his campaign in 2014.
The former carpenter claimed 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua, little has changed, and today the locals feel cheated.
"" "" "" "our hearts have been broken because we agreed in 2014 for Jokhoi, with the expectation that it will fill our hopes that justice will be restored," "" "says You." ""
In fact Paniai suffered only two months after the inauguration of Joko's inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas songs before a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them that they should switch on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offense on their tone and later returned to four soldiers, according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk, hunted and beat the group with their rifle pistons, said sacrifices and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was so severely beaten to fall into coma.
A few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bucks and performed the Waita dance - continuously and imitating a birds singing - from Papuas Mee Pago tribe.
Some demonstrators started throwing stones on the police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, the soldiers were sent an order via an internal radio: "if the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," says TIME in an official document that was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the threatening danger and called for peace and urged the crowd to return home.
Nobody was in the mood to listen.
"" "" "" "when I turned around, suddenly I was shot in my left wrist," "" "he said TIME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house." ""
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says that the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here.
"it was overcrowded, many shots were fired," he added.
The native man Alfius Youw was hit three times, his cousin, who was a witness to the shooting.
"" "" "" "I ran to him and tried his body to make sure he was it," "" "said Yohane, who like many Indonesians only bears a name, the TIME in dark mood." ""
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The chief inspector of the Papua-police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because it was attacked.
"" "" "" "we must defend ourselves if people are threatening to kill us," "" "said the spokesperson of the Papua police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015." ""
"it's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch five young demonstrators were killed and many others were injured.
The news of the killings took place only the following day 'filtered' to Jakarta.
Three weeks Jokowi held a passionate speech in Jayapura, in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swore to address the historic abuses in Papua.
"" "" "" "I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future," "" "he said." ""
The Minister of security, Wiranto, said in October 2016 that he would establish an extrajudicial mechanism for the consideration of historical human rights abuses.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90's and at the beginning of the 2000-ies.
"" "the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations, but there are processes that must go through," "" "he said." ""
Then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME on 5 June in Jakarta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
"" "instead, everything is regulated by law," "" "he said." ""
"" "" "" "Wiranto, which the UN charged with" "" "crimes against humanity" "", "which called for more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody independence referendum in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua were already included, including the Paniai incident." ""
"" "" "" "families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with grim disbelief." ""
"" "" "" "I was interviewed four times over the last three years, but there was no progress," "" "says Yohanes." ""
"I am tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"" "" "" "I'm afraid to be arrested by the military, I'm afraid to be shot." "" "" ""
His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that the people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was struck by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims.
"after I had buried the dead bodies, the military sought me," he says.
The shootings have not ceased.
On Tuesday the Indonesian police fired on villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a Baufirma who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital, a person and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, drowned when he fished in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested before the company's siting office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warnings.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd and killing one.
"" "" "" "we were so panic, we are afraid that there will be vengeance," "" "says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were delivered quickly here, the TIME." ""
"I hid myself two days in my house."
The Deiyai Parliament has called upon to hold the officers involved and withdraw the mobile brigade of the police from the territory.
Paniai was always a herd of rest for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of the tribe of Mee, Moni, Dani and damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free State Movement" (OPM), the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of Papua, attacking sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudie Kogoya.
In response to this, thousands of people were arrested in Paniai during the last years and arbitrarily taken into custody under the pretext of "securing national sovereignty."
Some never appear again.
"" "among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as" "" "a tragic forgotten place." "" "" ""
Poverty is strengthening the discontent.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is equally out of reach.
People here are building everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can work on four or five fields of sweet potato.
They retain the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over the course of time, economic inequalities between the native countries of Papua and the new migrants have grown, which since the opening of new flight routes to the airport of Nabire arrived in a larger number.
The few jobs in the region usually go to the better educated and more prosperous migrants.
"" "" "" "Papua people rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to compete with their own businesses." ""
"the young people are not interested in staying in the village... for there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of the Paniai family council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
Furthermore, restrictions on the reporting of international media remain tense.
At the beginning of the year French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia-director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Joko's electoral campaign have not been realised by the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development.
"" "" "" "there are new dangers to foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's unquiet eastern provinces of Papua and West papa: visa denying and a black list," "" "he said in an explanation." ""
A lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.
In March six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "different and widespread injuries" in Papua (including Paniai's shooting).
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
"" "the spokesman for Indonesian Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the accusations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta:" "" "in Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media so that it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights." "" "" ""
Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the Human Rights Ambassador Kees van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, indigenous people broke their silence and urged him "We want freedom," according to a source who participated in the meeting, but would like to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua people say that they will probably not vote for Jokhoi again.
"" "" "" "Jokhoi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots," "" "said Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council." ""
He wants Jokhoi to know that the Paniai people, apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predatory military, is in poor education and health services.
"" "Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their vote for Jokhoi as a" "" "debt" "" "he has to pay back." ""
"they don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shot-sacrifice carried out a last symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried in an area exactly opposite the police and the military station.
They know that perhaps they will never come to justice, but at least they will not forget those responsible for their crimes.
"" "" "" "a member of our family has been killed," "" "says Yacobus with a lowered head." ""
"what else can we do?"
Fire capturing the 'Torch' skyscraper from Dubai for the second time
A fire took place on Friday in one of Dubai's highest homes in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 337 meter high, 79-story building.
It is the second fire that sweeps through the high-rise in just two years, which is sometimes called the Torch Tower (Fackel Tower).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"" "" "" "we slept and we got up with fire alarm and people screaming." ""
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor, "an inhabitant named George Anab, Reuters.
Dubais civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units fire the fire at 4.00 a.m. local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled down the building.
The government said that they are working on providing accommodation to those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of skyscrapers around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage caused by cladding, external cladding to decoration or insulation came.
In Britain the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cladding at the Grenfell Tower in London could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died.
No Davis Cup Reform: next Best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has gone through with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the Ho Chi Minh City session, the only two-thirds majority for this sport was to play a revolutionary proposition to play Davis Cup single sole on two winning sets.
These often very long, but also therefore highly esteemed five-sentence classics remain the traditional competition thus.
63.54% of member countries voted for reform, the goal of ITF president David Haggerty was therefore only marginalized.
"" "" "" "we respect this decision, but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup." ""
"" "we need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions," "" "said Haggerty." ""
We will continue to work on improving the application.
Even before the vote, the proposal came after a lot of contradictions before the proposal to finish the final at a neutral place.
New starting in 2018 is only comparatively minor details: the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the next round in the following year.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements for training places etc. are facilitated and the players will have to complete less official media appointments in front of the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 US travelers brings forbidden items to the plane, finds a survey
A survey conducted among air passengers showed that more than 20 percent were deliberately smuggled into the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent carrying the plane while accidentally carrying prohibited knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent said they were belatedly discovered that they were mistakenly charged with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 persons, conducted by a Jet Charter Service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also noted that younger travellers would rather disregard the rules.
The respondents admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something that was forbidden by the TSA, were 19.7 percent millennials, compared with less than 15 percent, members of Generation X.
The most common items that were deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 per cent stated, knowingly borne items with blades by security control, while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought illegal drugs into the plane.
The company said it asked travelers all over the country to find out how many inadvertently smuggled goods through airport security and how many had done it deliberately.
It is no surprise that people who most likely smuggle in smuggled goods - knowingly or unknowingly - carry on safety, those who fly most frequently.
The company, however, points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure which fluids they are allowed to take with or how much of it.
So it is no surprise that the bulk of the objects confiscated by the TSA are forbidden liquids.
For a while people thought the TSA could watch books as smuggled goods.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care how to cancel tens of thousands of Tesla customers orders
Electric-Tausendsassa Elon Musk likes to deal with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3."
In doing so, he has failed so far that a part of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever triumphant figures for sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla leader Elon Musk has revealed another less impressive number for the first time in the announcement of the latest quarterly balance: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3.
In recent months, Musk frequently had more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery just begins.
Now, Musk admits: of the 518,000 pre-orders, 63.000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are merely non-binding reservations.
In case of a cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 Euros (in the US $1000 and in the UK 1,000 pounds) "Reservation payment."
At the present 45,000 of such non-binding reservations, Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to now about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.
Its argument: the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not in demand but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla supplied 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, all models are to be merged - 500,000, by 2020 one million.
The demand for this is obvious.
According to Musk, 1800 bookings are available per day.
Whoever orders a "Model 3" today must expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive his brand-new production lines never tested in practice without any major interruptions with maximum capacity utilization.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are greater delays, then the non-binding nature of the reservations may become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in droves.
EPA CEO Pruitt moves back because of the delaying of the Obama-Era rules to reduce emissions
One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, took back his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce the emissions of smog-induced air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency turned out to be more responsive to the needs of government authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the complaint lodged against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appeal.
"" "" "" "there is a deadline agreed on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 Ozone standards." ""
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay observing a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering with local decisions or hindering economic growth."
Pruitt, who was before his appointment by President Donald Trump's Prosecutor of Oklahoma, was a reliable opponent of tougher environmental protection for a long time.
Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly resorted to blocking or delaying regulation, which resists the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a Federal Judge Court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration, which required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his reversal of ozone standards quite simply reinforces the willingness of the EPA to co-operate with the States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards.
"" "" "" "under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be indicted by activists and others, and set the date for implementation in an agreement," "" "said Pruitt, who accused EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job." ""
"" "" "" "we do not believe in regulation by legal proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously." ""
"" "we also take the law and the authority we give to us seriously." "" "" ""
"" "nevertheless, the EPA statement said that Pruitt will eventually use his" "" "authority to delay and all other legally available powers" "" "to ensure that the rules are based on a sound policy and the best available information." "" "" ""
The Republicans in Congress push for a more comprehensive new version of the ozone rules.
A draft bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure was not yet made in the Senate.
The New York Deputy Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the Coalition of States, who had sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to uphold the legal pressure.
"" "" "" "the conversion of EPA - after our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," "" "Schneiderman said." ""
In this case, New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia.
Floor-Ozon occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people, and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Representatives of public health care and environmentalists cheered on Pruitts surprising change of course.
"it's worrying how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from those responsible for the protection of the air we inhale," said Lori Ann Burd of Center for Biological Diversity.
"" "" "" "we must continue fighting against the ideological crusade of the Trump government to bid on environmental pollsters and their special interests." "" "" ""
Tumble celebrates 750 Years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, a serenade is invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July, at 4: 30 p.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors of Tumlingens a concern.
Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique village gem."
In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergischer Ursel register: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei by master Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.
According to the text of the document, on the hill of Tumour, apart from the former parish church, there was also a magnificent court, where the church or patronage belonged, and not the other way round.
There were also people living there.
As from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt from 1858, it was beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the city image of Tumlingen, the "mountain" of the third, the magnificent settlers of the village.
Old maps from the period around the year 1600 confirm these historical facts.
The patronage law arose from the early medieval self-church law.
A gentleman who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.
Connected with this was the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The size of the two was shattered on Christmas 1673.
The newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over in 1942 during the Second World War.
In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were cut and the bells were stolen.
The roof was leaky.
In 1796 French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumour Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from radio welding.
In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the church of Hilariuskirche was demolished.
Only the steeple was left.
In the New Year's Eve 1834 a storm split the steeple and half fell.
To prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.
Only the present tower of Turmzwerg was preserved as a witness of the 750 years of the old church history.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Veil are cultivating the Hilarius facility by the "Schaffy Pensioners" as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn.
As organizers, the friends and sponsors of Tumlingens invite the old cemetery to St. Hilariuskapelle on Sunday, July 16th, to the sixth serenade.
This is designed by the Combo of Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with words by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Hartmut Romann refers to the final word.
The program starts at 4: 30 p.m.
Admission is from 3: 30 PM.
For the closing of the serenade, a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery.
"" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," "" "the organisers give out the fantastic view." ""
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is of importance for tumulls and hearers.
The friends and sponsors of Tumlingens feel particularly committed to home care, such as Serenade-organiser Walter Martini.
Association wants to have permission of wind turbines to be checked
"" "" "" "Boisheim resists" "" "does not see any legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the land rat." ""
"" "the association" "" "Boisheim resists" "" "has called upon Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his permit for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette." ""
It is unlawful.
The association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved at all, as at the time in Viersen, only at the town border to Schwalmtal there was a wind power concentration zone.
Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are fundamentally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.
"" "such zones should prevent a" "" "paramount" "" "of the landscape." ""
A few days before, the city of Viersen had decided to change the area of land into a second wind-force concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette - but the district government of Düsseldorf did not approve it because of a fault.
"" "" "" "due to the lack of planning law, the granted approval decision is still illegal and therefore also to be withdrawn," "" "said Christoph Erkens, President of" "" "Boisheim resists." "" "" ""
Current state of affairs: before the summer break, the City Council once again decided to use the wind concentric zone in the Boisheim Nette; a permit from the district government is still pending.
"" "Erkens:" "" "this means that the issuance of a permit for the construction of wind energy plants is excluded." "" "" ""
The circle confirms the entrance of the invitation.
"" "" "" "the corresponding letter has been received by district Viersen from last week," "" "declared a speaker." ""
The circle makes it the occasion to examine the matter again.
However, they do not expect the procedure to be stopped.
With regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the argumentation of the association "Boisheim resists."
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheim Nette.
Last year, the company, in which the city Viersen participates indirectly, closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare site.
With the establishment of the four wind turbines, the electricity demand of around 11 400 households is to be met - that is roughly one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four-bay households.
The NEW Re plans to invest some 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind farm in Übach-Palenberg in the district Heinsberg.
Car and Tractor crash together: woman dies in terrible accident
One terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederdormenbach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was mortally wounded.
Two more people were easily injured.
The road remained closed for hours.
According to the police, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich and her passenger car entered the L 333 in the direction of Bogel with her 53-year-old mother.
City and retailer planning "home shopping" weekend
Bad Langensalaer and people from the region will rediscover shopping opportunities in the city center in September.
The trade association and the municipal authorities want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract residents to shopping in the city centre.
As the chairman of the business association, Christian König, announced, the "home-shopping" weekend aims to sensitize customers about what offers their own city offers away from the usual supermarket commodity.
Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.
In addition, domestic firms should present themselves with their training places.
"" "in addition, the shops of the city center invite to" "" "Mitterhofer shopping" "". "" ""
The action is not only aimed at inhabitants of the city and the region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an internet video and printed bags which point to the action-weekend, so Christian König.
The city administration and commercial association co-operate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
In this way, the trade association and the city go into another stage of the project "Attractive Center."
This includes new offerings, such as the first "active day" to the well festival, with sales open on Sunday, talks with all professionals and hosts, in order to move them to active participation.
Also attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential is to be reopened or reopened.
This includes spa guests and tourists.
But also many locals lost sight of the city centre when shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to contribute to liven the city centre - to landlords, all the city's businesses and clubs.
It was necessary to overcome the lethargy with a network, which had been partly widened, and had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, announced that the nationwide third "home shopping" day, five Thüringer cities, will take part in the first time.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, this is Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
"" "the day should" "" "promote appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities," "" "said Streich." ""
The action conducted by the Chamber of Commerce of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence its direct surroundings with its purchasing behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
Construction work resulted in a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine more wounded, some of them difficult.
According to the fire brigade on Wednesday (local time), there was still a vulnerability in critical condition.
A man died when a part of a school building collapsed during the explosion.
A first missing was later found dead.
The dead were employees of the school.
As a matter of doubt, the authorities suspected working on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday period only a few people stayed in the building of the Minnehaha Academy.
Trump went bankrupt initialled transcripts of phone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post.
On 27 January, Trump announced in a telephone conversation with the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
"" "the US president undertook him because he had publicly denounced the wall. according to reports he said to him," "" "You can't tell the press." "" "" ""
Trump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA, and swore to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transcription of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the USA refugees who emigrated to Australia would be "ridiculous," "bad," and "dumb" and that the existence on the trade that was imparted by the Obama administration would make him look like a "Depp" after he had suggested a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he had said Mr Turnbull, "that's the most unpleasant phone call for the whole day."
Moore Ford massacre: activists fight racial lynch act as a call for justice
A 1948-er Ford Mercury rode through a group of viewers in Monroe, Georgia, and shrunk to the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, was able to reach the bridge, a group of white men came out with guns to block its way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a conifer-suit-suit - took a long train on his cigar and looked through the windshield.
Inside the occupants hovered in fear.
"" "" "" "we want this n ---- r Roger!" "" "the man roared." ""
"get it out of the car!"
Screaming broke the silence when a young black man was crushed by the passenger seat.
Thankfully, this horrible scene, which was played on July 22, is just a nightmare.
"" "but when a loop is thrown around the neck of" "" "Roger" "", "almost everyone in the audience kicked out very real sighs." ""
Since 2005 citizens have come back to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Dorothy Malcom as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - have been synched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one was ever accused of murder.
"" "" "" "it is really inconceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches, although we know who they are," "" "said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organizing the post." ""
"it is a stain on a story, but it is a burden for our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year old congressman of the state Georgia and a lifetime citizen.
For him, the postion serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe communion that a wrong has never been corrected.
"" "" "" "we want criminal prosecution, we want to finish, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," "" "he said." ""
"" "" "" "we cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice." "" "" ""
A court physician places a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford-Lynne on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI agents received from NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the LynchProcess.
But no one was ever accused.
Although the suspects remain on the free foot for decades, civil rights activists say that the double motivation for Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black citizens in Georgia to vote for their vote in the summer ballot campaign.
About the same time, according to the FBI, the black farmers, Roger Malcom, stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said that rumor in the city was that Hester had slept with Malcoms Mrs. Dorothy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband.
On 25 July 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white country owner, paid 600 dollars to free Malcom from prison.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they departed from prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"as it turns out, Harrison, who prepared and ordered the killings, concludes an FBI report.
"" "" "" "it is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution, which was not only involved in the killings, removing evidence and hiding the identity of witnesses." "" "" ""
Brooks puts it even more succinct.
"" "" "" "it was an election law massacre" "", "he said." ""
"" "" "" "they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community:" "" "if you want to register and if you vote, this will happen here." "" "" ""
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has conducted the annual production of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch-Morde.
Their depiction is vivid, poignant and is rooted in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe that in America it no longer exists.
It is difficult to watch, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that is the point.
"" "" "" "we don't want to talk about Lynch because we are confronted with its ugliness in all of us," "" "she said." ""
"" "" "" "but I cannot build a relationship with you, if you don't want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I've done." "" "" ""
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest of black - crowded into a room and listened to a well-coordinated view of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is here Greene Co-director.
He has played the role of chief executive member for many years, but he said that the role will never be easier.
"" "" "" "I feel dirty because I'm not so," "" "said Marbaugh." ""
"" "" "" "but I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to return to those times." "" "" ""
On the other side of the room the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rashid, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The piece starts with Malcom, the testator screams and hugs him, furious that he had slept with his wife Dorothy.
"" "" "" "I said n --- he, disappear from my property!" "" "" ""
Rashid fades the fire.
There is a break.
And then everybody (at least all black actors) breaks out into laughter.
Greene laughs at the loudest.
"" "" "" "what?!" "" "Rashid inquired." ""
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"" "" "" "no," "" "said Greene, still chuckling." ""
"" "" "" "I just don't think white people at that time 'n --- he' said." "" "" ""
"" "" "" "yet," "" "one of the other black actors was sweating." ""
"" "" "" "you just have to hit the hard" "" "R" "". "" ""
And that's exactly where the energy shifts in space, a sense of companionship has replaced the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not just because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rasmus says the N-word, he says it sharp and with reprint.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violent and fast.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman, dressed in a mourning dress, stands above the bodies of the actors and runs Billie Holidays in mourning praise of "Strange Fruit."
Her voice breaks at every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen viewers wipes out sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost equally divided between black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many come down just down the street.
They have spent nearly eight hours of Georas oppressive humidity when Brooks leads her on a pilgrimage to the tombs of Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when one stands in the same country where the Lynch killings took place, the air feels ghostly.
When the last notes of the song sound, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body's name.
Children sit on their heads, register the fake blood and the breastfeeding bodies and whisper each other.
"" "" "" "they're not really dead," "" "a little boy murmurs as if he wants to remember." ""
After a few minutes Greene thanked the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe their tears away.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in suit who has played the clan member.
Nick Rasys hugs two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms weeping, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through him.
"it's okay," one of the women whispers.
"" "" "" "we know this is not in your heart." ""
"" "you did it for one reason." "" "" ""
Later the audience joins the actors for dinner together.
At a table, a white pair from Atlanta talks about the posing with a black pair they just met.
Denise Duplinsky tried to find words that left the performance behind.
"" "" "" "it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds... to come from people that look like you and who do that because they look like you," "" "she said." ""
"" "" "" "what this really does with me makes me believe that Lynch still continues," "" "she added," "" "today it is called only police shooting." "" "" ""
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks is sitting at his table, eating and remembering civil rights.
He said he started planning the performance next year.
"" "" "" "the reproduction is in a certain way inspiring, because it describes the horrors of what we endured, but it is also a moment of learning," "" "he said." ""
"" "" "" "if we learn nothing from it, it can happen again." ""
Those who do not study their own history who do not know their own history are condemned to repeat them. "
"Götterdämmerung" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf relies on a colorful-frivolous production in front of a gigantic, six-story backdrop.
The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows either a shabby street corner with a wall rest and a Dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste and Elaste" logo from East Germany or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes classic car, in which the Rheinthal men posing as a rock band, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil drums remind of Castor's leitmotif - money, power and greed - that goes through his "ring" production.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonise beautifully as already in "Rheingold."
Cess also seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), a corpse in the luggage compartment in Hollywood-Manier and give the riot Clique.
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully clever Hagen that surrounds the aura of a weightlifboxer.
Brutal the scene when he smiles Siegfried.
Later it has to believe Gunther (Markus oak).
The audience thanks the ensemble with a strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski are celebrated stormy; he humbles himself and bends his hands to Merkel-Raute.
There is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra, which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual wear.
The show was eagerly awaited by Frank Castorf and his team.
"" "in 2013 he had to pass a gellenic pipe concert, five years later there were great cheers in which the scattered" "" "Buh" "" "calls went down." ""
Festspielchefin Katharina Wagner is likely to have been happy about this.
"" "" "" "one notices that the audience with the" "" "Ring" "" "has grown together in a way," "" "she said just before the performance of the dpa." ""
The audience has not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but also has grown an understanding of its view.
I prefer a positive résumé.
Max quantity working as a volunteer
They work in several places in their volunteer year.
Where anywhere?
Quantity: normally in Steinfurt, in the furniture fair, once a week I help in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I also worked at school in the open whole day.
What are your experiences with it?
Quantity: it is a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
They are now 26 years, thus a late professional volunteer.
How does that come about?
A lot: I did a high school.
And then a civil engineering study, let's say, successfully aborted.
I realized for myself that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something different with people working.
And then I asked myself what are you doing.
Do a social year, there is an insight where you can see how it is, in the focal point, maybe also, really.
And was it like that?
Lot: I collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in social welfare in the winter semester.
I'm going to study the dual, probably in the Jugendamt Herne, I'm studying a social worker and studying in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service?
Quantity: yes, it is very variable.
It always depends where you are doing your FSJ.
It is possible to do it from retirement home to youth work - in all aspects of social work.
With me it was very varied.
I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me it was just the right thing that matured me.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works.
Different from civil engineering studies?
A lot: well, it's not about calculating Statiks here.
There are always other people who have a completely different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, be it a teenager, who has been brought out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have reservations?
Quantity: I'm not the guy for that.
It is an area that gives a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but that's the way life is.
Pearson cuts further 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revive business
The British education group Pearson said on Friday that she will cut another 3,000 jobs and cut their interim dividend by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure with which the company is confronted.
In addition to its previous restructuring, the job reductions attributed to the general director John Fallon in late 2018 and early 2019 are in addition to his previous restructuring where 4,000 jobs have already been lost.
Pearson announced in May in a third cost reduction program a cost reduction plan by another 300 million pounds (394 million US dollars) to revive a business driven by the fast pace of digital learning.
The company, which last month sold its stake in Penguin Random House to the partner Bertelsmann, said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after a 1 percent increase in the first half of the year to 2.05 billion pounds.
Kabul convoy's attack: NATO soldier killed at suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Kabul, Afghanistan, killed a NATO soldier and injured several others, say officials.
"" "" "" "five soldiers and an interpreter have been injured," "" "said NATO." ""
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians died in the attack in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has taken this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people close to the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
In an opinion of Nato it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "improvised explosive device" carried by people. "
The statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and treated at the US military hospital on the Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a great concern for NATO troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
On 31 May, a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the deadliest militant attack in the country, since the US-led forces pushed the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as U.S. President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that in recent weeks the suicide bombings in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, the call of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA Returns Decision to Delay Smog Rule after defeats
The U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration, in which States are obliged to curb the smog-causing emissions. this took place a day after 15 States sued the agency for the sake of stepping.
"" "the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so-called" "" "ozone provisions of 2015" "", "and said they show the commitment of the agency to work with States." ""
"" "" "" "we believe in dialogue and that we respond to our state partners," "" "said EPA CEO Scott Pruitt in an explanation." ""
In June Pruitt announced the intention of the EPA to determine the Ozone provisions in which pollutant emissions should be measured in a part of the country to specify where clippings must be made to delay the stricter level of air quality - to delay a year until October 2018.
A group of 15 largely democratic states, along with the Colombia district, filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
The government of President Donald Trump has tried to return a wide range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama, as part of a broader agenda that is to boost economic growth according to Trump.
"" "" "" "however, efforts have triggered the setbacks of democrats and conservatives who are worried about the impact of larger emissions on public health." ""
"" "the EPA's website says that inhaling air containing ozone" "" "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms," "" "such as asthma." ""
Common Forum wants community room
In the end, the decision was clear: in two opposing voices, the municipal council of Fluorio Winner decides to establish a common room in the future seniors residence.
Before the discussion there is an important information: the purchase contract for the still missing part of the property was signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
It will take a while until the church community has so far been owned by community, but now there is no need for planning for the project to be stemmed from a private investor.
There is a discussion about a common space for this.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, it would provide a living space - around 55 square meters - and an adjoining terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and majority of the Municipal Council hovers in front of such a common space not to be seen as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the elderly-righteous living, but openly in the church.
"" "for example, the word" "" "Strickcafé" "" "made the round." ""
"" "" "" "the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided last autumn by funding opportunities." ""
The building is in the refurbishment area.
The establishment of a common room would be, as reported Tjaden, capable of promoting 60 percent of 30 percent.
The proposed resolution looks at the investor to signal that in this respect it does not want to throw a stick between the legs, the statement that both semitrail- and the surrounding buildings - as well as a pulpit - would be possible.
Needless to say, not only Wilfried Sohmer means this addition.
When it helps: unanimously, he passes the body.
It's not as easy as the common room.
Daniela's call refers to the many buildings that are not so easy to move forward, but now they lean into the common room out of the window, she says: "I am struggling with it."
Yvonne Staiger absolutely speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation.
It sees behind it a hidden subsidy to either wealthy or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because with the purchase of the surface there is no surplus, but I get a real counter-value in the case of doubt, the counter-speech is.
"" "" "" "Stayers's request to track down the proposal will find three proponents." ""
"" "this is how it remains with two counterparts in the original programme that summarizes Stefan Haller:" "" "if we grasp the decision, we make a giant leap to close a huge gap in our infrastructure." "" "" ""
Collision with car: Radler is thrown on the road
When crossing the road, a 82-year-old cyclist on Wednesday in Garath was captured by a car and seriously injured.
As the police informed, the 82-year-old Langenfelder was on the bicycle track of the road Schwarzer Weg from the direction of Hilden approaching at 12.20 o'clock.
The senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the road Am Buchholzer Busch.
A passenger car driving in the same direction was given priority.
When the Langenfelder was on the road, he obviously didn't pay attention to the counter-traffic.
He met with a car that controlled a 66-year-old Hildenerin.
The man was thrown into the street.
He suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a return carriage.
FC Bayern Munich has to do without Borussia Dortmund in the Supercup at David Alaba and Thiago
The Supercup will take place without him: David Alaba will have to suck the game against Dortmund.
With personnel safety, the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory play of the new season.
Seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the winner of the Cup.
The staff members at the German football record champion Bayern München are getting bigger before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 p.m. / ZDF and Eurosport) at Pocalsieger Borussia Dortmund.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti does not have to forgo David Alaba in the duel with the BVB.
The Italian confirmed on Friday.
The Munchmen Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeats in the past six trials, Ancelsius made the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team.
"" "" "" "we know that we are not in the best physical condition," "" "said Ancelotti and added:" "" "the most important point is the balance in the team." ""
"" "that was not good at last." "" "" ""
However, the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season.
"football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities.
The team is ready.
"" "we want to play intelligent," "" "said Ancelotti, expecting a" "" "difficult, intense game" "". "" ""
The duel of the two German football heavyweights put the fans under their spell.
The game is sold out with 81.360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Walking in the resin from the star to the star
"" "the first" "" "Starpath" "" "is to be created in the resin." ""
This is planned by the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003.
"" "a" "" "starpath" "" "is coming to meet the need for information of many visitors." ""
It connects nature, science, movement and athletic performance.
The members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations.
"" "in a first phase until 2018, the association plans" "" "good-to-reach installations in five to six locations" "" "in Oberharz." ""
Question: St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the panels should be supplemented by the internet.
This is why a good mobile network reception has a role in the selection of locations.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later the Starpath Ticket to Ride is to be extended.
"" "" "" "on the starpath the viewer experienced a lot of worth knowing, for example about the physics of the individual stars," "" "the association explained." ""
They also learned why stars have different colors, or why a star is more luminaire than another, even though it is much further away.
Also, in which constellation is a selected star and when it is best to see.
The association has been operating the highest observatory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg.
According to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation, the location in the middle of the National Park Harz is one of the six darkest regions in Germany.
Often from there the Milky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy with the naked eye can be seen clearly.
Since 2003, there is something similar to the Planetary Trail in the Uni-Stadt (Initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen).
Starting in front of Gebhard's Hotel in the Goetheallee that forms the interior of our solar system, the Planetary Trail leads up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "extra-terrestrial" site in Diemarden (community of Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.
The stelae with the individual planets - including the Pluto at the end point of the dwarf Planet - are set exactly at the distance and the scale of one to two billion.
The Earth shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun is exactly 75 metres away and measures 70 centimeters.
The entire distance from the planet path is just four kilometres.
While the light of Sun requires approximately eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour up to the plug with Pluto.
Pedestrians are thus faster than light in the cosmos.
The march to the next fixation would take half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time discussing a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were to stand in a collision course in order to stage the most exciting boxing match under 147 pounds in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion who went down to Lomachenko to greet the World Boxing Organisation super-suspension champion.
After Garcia's victory through a unanimous decision on the former four Divisions World Champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five Pound-for Pound list.
"" "Garcia stretched out his right hand and said," "" "How are you, champion?" ""
I wish you good luck. "
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude."
"I am a former spring weight," Garcia remembered.
"" "" "" "I rose up for bronze [to 140 pounds], but I am not so great." ""
I am small for 140.
I would like to come down to light weight.
And he must move to lightweight weights [135 pounds] and then we fight.
They demand the fans.
Let us give them this. "
Lomachenko was right.
"boxing takes this fight."
Klimas asked whether it should be on Pay-per-View, part of a strategy that Lomachenko must fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree on the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell following their lightweight-weight title fight in the Forum on September 23.
"" "" "" "this fight could take place in pay-per-view mode, because all fans asked for it," "" "Garcia said, and later expressed himself openly to fight with the network offering the best financial package." ""
We are the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready... "
Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter," and he may be participating in his Saturday battle.
"" "but Lomachenko held with the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks the three-fight champion from Riverside looks very slow, sorry Mikey... you wanted the co-Aus." "" "" ""
Garcia said that the focus was to show drummer strength, then boxes.
Both said they could feel the momentum that built up for their own struggle.
"" "" "" "this is the battle that must be carried out." ""
No other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
"" "I'm more than happy to work on it," "" "said Garcia." ""
"" "Lomachenko said," "" "I waited for the top warriors, and that's Mikey." ""
It will be a great fight. "
Four injured to the top of the tyre
In the case of an accident on the A7, four people were injured in part heavily on Thursday afternoon.
After the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control over his vehicle shortly before the end of the market.
The car hurled to the right into the embankment, where it overcame and then remained on the roof in the green stripe.
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were badly injured in the accident.
During the first provision of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was locked in the direction of the north for about an hour, then the traffic on the left side of the lane could be passed by the accident site.
Fortuna Hoffmann: "three-chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann is hoping for the 2: 2 season opener for the season opener that optimizes the defense formation in Aue points.
With the first round of the season Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result as well, wouldn't have been the two opposers at 2: 2 against Braunschweig.
"" "" "" "these were two opponents too much, and we have to watch out even better in Aue," "" "says Fortuna Düsseldorf defenders." ""
In the Erzgebirge, the three-chain is to be further optimized.
And a gate after a free hit do not want to catch up the runes any more.
"" "" "" "for the future there will be no more besides Michael (Rensing) on the line." "" "" ""
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will get better after the experiences in preparation with the three-chain, than with the four-chain.
"I don't yet know how we will act in Aue," says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is confident of his cause, "because we have right in the three-chain at the halfway positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build up well," Hoffmann said.
"" "" "" "the prerequisite is, however, that we are even better harmonizing and we do not have so many playing errors in the construction." "" "" ""
Of course Hoffmann goes to Aue to win the game.
"" "" "" "but if you can talk about a failed start, you don't know." ""
"" "the performance could be okay," "" "said Hoffmann." ""
"" "" "" "but if we have four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the trophies, we will certainly be able to speak of a good season opener." "" "" ""
His trainer didn't want to know anything about that.
"" "" "" "I do not judge the start into the season only after six to eight playing days," "" "said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to talk about an advantage over Aue just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be cancelled due to a storm." ""
"" "" "" "now they can start the season with a home game," "" "said Funkel and Hoffmann believe that the players from Aue might be even a bit fresher because they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascension favorite in the bones." ""
"" "" "" "but they don't know so 100% where they are at the moment," "" "says the Fortuna." ""
Admittedly, the guests from the Rhineland are considered an easy favourite on Sunday in the meeting at the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"that we sweep it away simply because we have the right to get under the first six is bullshit," says Funkel, whose balance sheet with only one defeat against Aue out of nine games is quite positive.
"" "" "" "there is no team in the second Bundesliga which one has to beat from the beginning," "" "explains Fortuna Head coach." ""
"making such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And so Funkel does not want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results from Swedish asylum-based evaluation tests published
Recent results of trials for asylum seekers in Sweden submitted to a new method for medical assessment of their age show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Medicinal Drug Administration (Rättsmedicinalverket) started the tests last year.
During the asylum process, they are to take a closer look at the assessment of age after the Swedish Migration Service (Migrationsverket) has been criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who have been minor.
Until today, migration salaries have sent 6,880 tests to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were considered 18 or older, while in further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."
In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person "may be under the age of 18."
The tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are constant over the past few months.
"" "" "" "we don't see a big difference in the statistics of the past months, the figures are pretty constant," "" "he said to The Local." ""
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean the asylum seeker has lied about his age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases that "suggest that the examined person was 18 years or older."
When the paper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 results, she noted that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of the medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints are made, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they were usually preceded by puberty sooner or later.
"I had reason to think about it and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
Assessing biological age in this way is very unsafe.
"" "if we cannot confidently say, we should not do as if we could," "" "he said to the Metro." ""
"" "however, Göransson of Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests:" "" "in general, you can say that the risk of a child as an adult is negligible." ""
"" "the biggest risk is that if the person is under 18, in this case, this is about 10 percent." "" "" ""
Full in the plan
The works on the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"" "" "" "we are very good at the time, it works great," "" "says Reinhold Leicht, Head of the Road Engineering Department and Transport in the Regierungspräsidium Freiburg." ""
In April, the works began at the same time on all three bridges in need of refurbishment between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The end of the building is planned for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule will be met.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads across the Trombach.
It is an arch bridge made of concrete, covered with red sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 metres.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10,60 metres long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now been preserved on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.30m wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.
This is a border fastener, which is also used as operating distance.
A 2.20-metre-wide bridge-cap is to be used on Friday at the southern part of the bridge.
Then the pedestrian walkway is to run.
The special thing about it is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
Special fingertip feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a fibre-optic cable to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed in advance of the work by handouts about the project.
Furthermore, fish and crabs had to be fished.
For bridges between the building yard and the conglomeration in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated by a traffic light.
"" "the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel" "" "Tannenhof" "" "and" "" "Seven Linden" "" "is fully closed for construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach town entrance." ""
The costs for the three bridges together amount to €700,000.
The whole thing is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: under protest with German potato salad
It is not so common that parties pull together, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to reconcile.
The parties represented in the circle of volcanic Eifel (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, left) belong to a broad alliance that shows peacefully this day, because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle invites Rondell to a "big election campaign."
And well-known names start - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24, and the deputy president Beatrix of Storch.
But those who are on site hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD-lern but demonstrate.
"" "the motto" "" "Eifel remains colorful." "" "" ""
Originally, the town picnic under the motto "All at a table" was planned on the fountain square, but is now on the parking lot below the Rondells - and thus right in front of the eyes of those coming to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.
A colourful picture that is offered.
And what Christa Karoli, chair of the Forum A World and one of the authoritative organizers, is really happy: "great how many people came together here."
"" "there is music and lots of food, including a" "" "uralistic potato salad, which could also eat the AfD easily," "" "says the woman who brought him along." ""
The police has ordered a lot of civil servants to Gerolstein, showing a presence especially at the station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompe reports from the AfD vulcanic Eifel, he tried to do such an event and get the supplement.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf was first asked in Daun, but there was a cancellation, because there were not enough parking spaces available because of the built-up garden.
Now the Rondell is pleased that "we can have such a nice event here."
"" "looking at the event on the Rondellplatz he says:" "" "this is the good right of people, the main thing, it remains peaceful." "" "" ""
There is also a band for entertainment at around 20 o'clock on the Rondellplatz a band for entertainment, in the Stadthalle several speakers, among them the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD-chairwoman Uwe Jung.
In the hall there are about 200 people waiting for the candidate to vote for the election of the Bundestag, Alice Weidel, and the deputy president Beatrix of Storch.
The police presence remains unchanged, but until now the officials had a quiet evening.
A little more than an hour, the AfD event, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there it is announced shortly after 21 o'clock.
The police can press down - no special occurrences.
Trombone meets trumpet
A meeting with the Wolfacher Posaunisten Frederic Belli is available in the series Haslacher KlosterConcertos tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 pm in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black sea meets Black Forest," or even "Balkan folklore" meets classical German training with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchestras.
Thus Petkov Solotromper is the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is Soloposaunist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire to not only exceed the limits on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
In this way Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new guise, Daniel Schnyder's world music unites with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by the jazz musician Nils Wogram, classical, jazz and free play combine to form a fascinating overall art work.
This piece of the programme was first performed with a huge success in Freiburg this spring.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more: the Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.

West Virginia Governor announces that he changes the party
The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday evening in a demonstration with President Trump that he would change the party.
"" "whether you like it or not, the democrats have removed from me," "" "said Governor Justice." ""
"" "" "" "today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of rethinking... Today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia, I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor." "" "" ""
The rally broke out in jubilation.
"tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
"" "" "" "as a coach I would say it's time to play another game." "" "" ""
Mr. Trump announced a big announcement in the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not endorse the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns carbon mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father.
It is worth approximately $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, on Thursday evening the Republican National Committee issued an explanation in which it said: "the change of the Party of Governor Justice is yet another blow to a Democratic Party, which would rather prevent us from working to make our country great again."
"" "" "" "with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the final rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without guidance and is not able to find a positive, engaging message," "" "said RNC president Ronna McDaniel in an explanation of the CBS news." ""
"" "COE praises" "" "honest" "" "Russian excuse for doping scandal" ""
The world leader of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be reabsorbed into the sport.
Russian athletics head Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF World Championships on the eve of the Athletics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from sport and that he was determined to fight the doping.
"" "he said that he was sorry for" "" "all athletes, who were seized by competitors gold and silver medals." "" "" ""
Despite its comments, the IAAF congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) had found evidence of state-sponsored Doping in Russia.
"" "" "" "I thought it was a very open response today, a very honest presentation," "" "said IAAF President Coe the reporter." ""
"" "" "" "the whole Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation recognized by itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned." "" "" ""
"" "COE said he was also" "" "delighted" "" "that Russia accepted the criteria for its re-launch." ""
"" "" "" "I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but the Congress does support the Task Force's recommendations that it is not the moment to use Russia again," "" "Coe said." ""
"" "" "" "we have to do everything in the coming months to normalize this situation." ""
"" "the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the depraved system," "" "he added." ""
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete in the World Athletics World Championships, which begin on Friday in London, following the stringent IAAF criteria as neutral actors.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia had to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.

Obituary for soldiers of Mali Stoned in Mali
At a funeral service in the North Hessen town of Fritzlar, around 1000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures.
According to Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU), Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the unsolved crash.
"" "they described the two opposite pilots as" "" "Könner of their trade." "" "" ""
"" "" "" "we bow before this highest sacrifice that they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany," "" "she explained." ""
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Stabshauptmann of Nordhessen came to life on Wednesday a week ago in Mali.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a vigil of the Bundeswehr in the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter.
At midday only the members of the church took leave.
After that, the funeral celebration began in the circle of the family, closest friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr as well as politics.
Among them were Hessens Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the General Inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
The branches of mourning lay down, the relatives stood arm in the arm of the coffins.
In front of the church Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
"" "the Minister of Defence of the Leyen called the soldiers" "" "highly decorated" "" "and saddled in." ""
The Stabshauptmann has built the flight operations of the fighting helicopter tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained tigers of his regiment.
Also Volker Bauersach, commander of the regiment, to whom the soldiers belong, declared: "if this occupation could not turn down the crash, nobody would have liked it."
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show the minister of the Leyen: the deployment was dangerous.
"" "but it is also of great importance" "" "for a country we are separated only by two states," "" "she said." ""
After the funeral ceremony the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik wants no grave next to his wife
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), will not be buried next to his wife after his death.
"" "" "" "this is what the King's House said on Thursday." ""
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried at the Roskilde cathedral.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen was in agreement with her husband's decision.
It is unclear where Prince Henrik will be buried.
But he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title.
After the accession of his wife Margrethe in 1972 he would have liked to become king.
"" "he retired in 2016 and also cuts the title" "" "Crown Prince" "". "" ""
Since Henrik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted, he did not see himself as equal to his wife - even after death, Lene Balleby, the chief speaker of the Danish royal court.
The last resting place of the 83-year-old will ultimately be unclear.
But he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he has worked for over the past 50 years.
The native Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French nobility, met Margrethe in London in 1965.
At the Thames he worked in the French embassy.
During his later wife, the sympathies of the people, Prince Henrik had a heavy stand in his nearly 50-year-old reign.
"" "in an autobiography, Henrik stated about the first years in Denmark:" "" "a few months after my arrival everything I did was criticised." ""
My Danish was wavering, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk socks instead of knitting socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gaulises I smoked instead of Virginia-tobacco and who had the reputation in this country to be the brand of socio-critical intellectuals, I could not hope for indulgence.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed.
"" "these were two mistakes!" "" "" ""
Prime Minister Weil wants rapid re-election
CDU and FDP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony
According to the loss of the red-green government majority for a rapid re-election of the Landtag, Niedersachsen's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) does not want to resign.
"" "" "" "because of the resolution of the Parliament on Friday." ""
Previously, the surprise of a Green deputies from their Landtag fraction in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the Landtag elections the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its scarce one-voice majority in parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
Elke Tests, a former Green Party member, founded her step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in its constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained on Friday in Hanover.
Ms. Björn Thümler, CDU leader, wants to recommend his Group to include her.
With that, CDU and FDP together with 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament, SPD and Green 68 seats would have.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new Landtag is regularly elected on the 14th of January next year.
"" "" "" "Thümler said the red-green state government must now decide whether it could govern in this situation without a majority." ""
However, Stephan Weil believes it is indispensable that the Landtag decides to resolve its own self-resolution as quickly as possible.
The CDU faction is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
"" "" "" "state Constitution also provides the opportunity for the Prime Minister to withdraw his trust and elect a successor." ""
"our Constitution provides several options.
"" "these options must be checked legally clean," "" "said Thümler." ""
"" "" "" "one will calmly discuss all the questions if they are properly examined." "" "" ""
"" "Thümler called" "" "TWest's step" "" "but something kurios." "" "" ""
"" "the politician himself stressed:" "" "I am not a traitor." ""
"" "I feel very good." "" "" ""
She described herself as a follower of black-green.
"" "" "" "the Greens called for the dissident legislators to return their country's mandate." ""
"" "" "" "of course, we assume that it returns its agricultural mandate, which it has received via the Green Land List, with immediate effect," "" "said the president Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner." ""
"" "s & D Group leader Anja Piel said:" "" "we deeply regret the decision of Elke Tests." "" "" ""
"" "" "" "she has deliberately decided not to speak pronunciation in the group." ""
"" "" "" "even against the background that there were no differences in content, we cannot understand this step." "" "" ""
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the resignation of the Lower Saxony Green Party members Elke Tests as a betrayal.
"" "" "" "the behaviour of former Green Party members in Lower Saxony is not only treason to voters, but also treason to red-green," "" "wrote the German Social-Democrats leader on Facebook on Friday." ""
He supported the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to quickly choose the Landtag.
The exit of Twestens costs red-green in Lower Saxony the majority.
"" "the politicians" "" "in their vanquished vanity and in their frustration are their personal interests before the good of the country," "" "said SPD general secretary Hubertus Heil." ""
"" "" "" "it is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony participates in this dirty trick game and tries to make it political capital." "" "" ""
Niedersachsen's CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his deputies to include Elke Tests in the CDU.
The leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, designed vests to falsify the results of the 2013 Landtag election with personal career gifts.
The CDU was at that time the strongest power in front of the SPD, SPD and Greens had a very thin majority of a vote in the Parliament day.
Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from gypsies, Mr. Schmidt?
Germany discusses polluted eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
The Minister of Agriculture, Christian Schmidt (CSU), talks and answers in an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mr. Schmidt, How can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
"" "" "" "I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp printed." ""
On the consumer protection portal www.growarnung.de, the federal states provide the latest information on the eggs-batches concerned.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, after all, what we are currently aware of is a health hazard practically excluded.
Aldi now takes over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of supply - because the central role of the clarifier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the task of the federal states.
In spite of this, my house has turned upside down and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany's dismissal.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
As well as the manufacturers, trade has to ensure that the products sold are traffic-capable and harmless to health.
If the residual oil content of eggs exceeds 0.005mg / kg, these are non-transferable.
Unloaded eggs can however be sold and eaten.
This time, the companies are not to blame.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
As far as knowledge is concerned, production plants do not meet any direct debt.
On the contrary, they have to reckon with economic damage as a result of presumed illegal practices of service providers.
As always, there is too little control in the emergency.
Is it missing only in the personnel or also in conclusive competence?
It was precisely the official controls that revealed the process.
However, the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent ruled out.
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent education of such events and the transfer to the prosecutors in the cases in which crimes can be present are of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear that I expect a complete clarification by the responsible authorities.
Is regular alarms really necessary for food scandals?
"" "" "" "consumers have the right to only get safe and marketable food." ""
If a non-approved insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are justified by law.
By means of the paneled means, manufacturers, traders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In general, it must be clear that the unlawful use of the insecticide irradiil in the attitude of food-sustaining animals is intolerable and must be terminated immediately.
You have to work consistently and with high pressure on all levels.
I expect from all relevant authorities that the facts are solved speedily and comprehensively.
How the finance rules of football on Neymars move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded expenditure on European football associations will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Saint Germain.
Any consequences will come from the UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain, as the guiding organization who oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious champions league tournament.
Financial Fair Play Regulations that were launched in 2011 by the UEFA mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer from Neymar was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilians out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.
PSG can make money easy for Neymar to sign up and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, in view of the financing of the team by the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but have to deal with legitimate income sources that allow them to break even the break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs which had taken enormous debts in their quest for success effectively cheated and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP declined from concentrating on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses.
The change meant that the business model, which Roman Abramovich used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue.
During the current three-year FFP investment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses amounting to 30 million euros.
And although Platini has fallen in favour of the presidency in 2015, its successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to discourage excessive expenditure.
"" "" "" "surely FFP is not dead and we will surely reinforce the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at the UEFA, compared to The Associated Press in the past week." ""
Although the PSG has paid the Buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract.
"" "" "" "Neymar signed a five-year contract, so that the sum total of €44.4 million can be accounted for in the financial statements for the next five years." ""
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 brought the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros ($82 million at that time), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a catastrophic company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market sets, UEFA would not allow this to be considered a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments of the organizing committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar WM will be ambassador and such a manoeuvre for UEFA regulators could easily be figured out.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to ignore any attempt to circumvent the rules.
The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, announcing on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.
They talked about the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than €10 million with a turnover of €542.4 million.
Accounts for the last fiscal year have to be published.
PSG expects that Neymars arrival is a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and tricot sales.
The association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after signature.
The Spanish League was clearly labeled to see one of the best football players, and tried to prevent Neymars move by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the president of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar's last ownership stake in PSG." ""
Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American Sport-Tycoon, shares the reservations of La League against a state financed by an association.
"" "" "" "it is the consequence of the ownership and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the past 15 years," "" "Wenger said on Thursday." ""
"once a country has an association, everything is possible.
"" "" "" "it will be very difficult to respect the financing of Fairplay because it is possible to have different ways or have different interests, if a country has such a great actor to represent a country." "" "" ""
Swiss is looking for a new shooter supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey board chocolate has produced Swiss-style chocolate.
Now the sweet cooperation is facing a possible end: the airline is rewriting the contract.
"" "Swiss speaker Meike Fuhlrott also confirmed on request of the news agency sda a corresponding report of the newspaper" "" "Nordwestschweiz" "" "of Friday." ""
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"we are very happy with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the speaker.
About 17 million tiny shocking shocks of 14 grams are distributed each year before landing on passengers.
The Swiss did not want to give any information about the costs.
According to "North West Switzerland," industry insiders estimate the volume of orders to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of about 1 billion Swiss francs.
But more important is the advertising effect: it is a prestigious order for a shooter manufacturer.
The Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants have submitted it to the new tender.
But only Swiss manufacturers come into question.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey will endeavour to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
For the sda the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not achievable for a comment.
Swiss have been distributing chocolate bars on board their flights since 2006.
Before signing a contract with the Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut had supplied the chocolate tablet in collaboration with Hug.
Swiss Life took the opportunity to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline cooperates with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers will be spoiled with goodies from the Sprüngli Confiserie, in the business class nasal passengers Schoggi by Lindt and in Economy Class Schoggi by Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi also distributes Schoggi from Chocolat Frey, both in business and economy class.
Athletics - Discus Olympic Champion Robert Harting reaches World Cup final
The triple world champion fights for a medal on Saturday in the final.
His brother Christoph, Olympic Champion of 2016, had failed in the national championship excretion and was able to look at the discus competition only from the tribune.
Also with the first attempt the Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski qualified for the final fight, Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 metres away.
Nostalgia goes to "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the niche
This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80's, for the 90-year-grunge era (as the pioneer David Wain and Michael Showalter the Sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for himself - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd were going to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise it feels like time is running out.
"" "" "" "first Day of Camp" "" "worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humors (it contained an original story for a speaking can of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin)." ""
By focusing on the core of the gags - middle-aged actors play cool kids who grow up - yet they have the impossibility to win the final part of the Witzes back.
Ten Years Later, with his adults, who now play adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the watering pattern principle, including a riff on Stalker's films of the 90's like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("Die Hand That Keeps the Cradle").
At one point, a character runs through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."
Many of the central stories are the same.
The amiable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
And there's another crazy evil plot involved in Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-done impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the exams are the best part of the franchise.
"" "it is especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons's underwater beard of" "" "singles" "", "whose former big-man-on-camp Andy is now feeling like an old boy." ""
It's the moments of random insanity that could heat up this franchise as a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until he achieves what I see as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the band premiere of Wet Hot American Summer.
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia: the revival of Cold War by "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East versus West wrestling iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka as director gives us the chance to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues are synchronised by Channing Tatum (also an executing producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It is an ingenious idea.
But it is not much more than an idea.
There are a few beautiful gags to look at (the police spends the time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent game 'Find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so much involved in the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single.
With six long episodes, it moves along, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"" "" "" "Comrade Detective" "", "which has been reduced to a lesser length, could better deliver his Agitprop satire, since Gregor and Iosef keep visiting the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers." ""
The message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for food.
The fictitious Romanian authors were not wrong: we even do it with our own younger story and with theirs.
Slap against drugs mafia in the country
The police shot a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Baar district, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the public prosecutor Constance filed on Friday.
In doing so, 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and had already issued arrest warrants against them.
In addition, the officers established larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms as well as several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested in Italy during the same raid in Italy.
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects Italians.
The two will probably be extradited to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the campaign.
A total of more than 300 policemen were in use.
The members of the Mafia are accused of organized trafficking of drugs, heavy acts of violence, attempted murder as well as robbery and blackmail.
As early as summer 2016, the public prosecutor's office established Constance against organised drug trade in southern Germany.
Between the public prosecutors in Constance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Cripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the Grand Prix was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning.
The aim of the investigations was mainly Italian nationals with close relation to the Italian Mafia.
Also a incident on 27th May in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, is likely to go to the bonds bank account.
Large gaps in the foreigner's register
"" "" "" "data from citizens who should not show up" "" ": according to a report, the foreign registry office in Germany shows significant deficiencies." ""
This leads to partly serious misdecisions regarding asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the commissioner for the refugee management of the German government, Frank-Jürgen Weise, pointed out to a large number of gaps in the Ausländerbehörde.
"" "deficiencies in the data recorded there could lead to" "" "grave wrong decisions" "" "in case of asylum procedures and deportations, warned in an analysis of the" "" "Süddeutsche Zeitung" "". "" ""
According to the Register, ten million people with foreign citizenship are registered in the register, including around 5.7 million people from non-EU countries.
The data will therefore be administered by approximately 600 Aliens Authorities in Germany.
Because the data have not been sufficiently maintained, the quality of data has not been good in parts so far.
"" "in individual cases data from 1921 were found," "" "of people who are no longer in life, or by citizens who have become German citizens and should actually no longer appear in the register." "" "" ""
"" "" "" "faulty data input may slow down return processes," "" "says the report." ""
The statistics on sufficient people are also included in EU citizens who don't have to leave at all.
"" "such false arrangements, however, led" "" "to a distorted debate on how to deal with sufficient" "", "it is therefore stated in the analysis." ""
Meanwhile, the Federal Government has apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with under 16-year-old children, when they came from there.
"" "this results from an internal paper of the Federal Office of Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the" "" "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" "". "" ""
"" "in the paper it is said that the BAMF is conducting such procedures" "" "concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017." "" "" ""
Since the end of 2014 this was virtually no longer possible, so the newspaper referred to the difficult situation on site.
"" "" "" "after the Dublin Agreement, the EU state is responsible for refugees who first reach them." ""
If a immigrant continues to travel to another EU country, this state can send it back to the entry-country.
"" "the office now writes:" "" "in the meantime, the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly." "" "" ""
Italy provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
"" "" "" "other EU states would also send asylum to refugees as part of the Dublin Agreement." ""
"" "the domestic spokeswoman of the left-hand faction in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticised the decision:" "" "families with children are threatened because of the deficiencies in the Italian asylum system of unlawful reception conditions and a threat to child welfare." "" "" ""
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 liters of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach already provided blood donation service to other people.
At least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
Jürgen Greule, who has now donated 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, in the meeting of the council, the community honors multiple readiness to donate blood.
"" "" "" "it is ingenious how our body is designed for it and we pay respect for the donors who make their blood available to strangers," "" "underlined Mayor Karlheinz Kistner." ""
"a single blood donation helps several people," explained the Regional Development Manager of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the canned foods are decomposed into their constituents.
So three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisman reported about the actions carried out in Oberreichenbach in the spring.
"" "" "" "this year, we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," "" "said the DRK district manager." ""
Obviously, the change in the theatre house led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago.
Already before, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umrel were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 contributions in donated blood.
Half as many as Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter emitted ten times each 500 milliliter of their life-juice.
The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England will probably later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and weakening of inflation have dampened speculation about an increase.
"" "" "" "the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain" "" "sluggish" "" "as it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure." ""
The political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members reaching a rise in this month, as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an upliftment.
In its quarterly inflation forecast, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that the pressure on budgetary income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to almost 3% in the fall.
But she signaled that interest increases would be necessary over the next few years to curb the inflation of inflation and she said that loan costs would have to rise more than expected on the financial markets.
The members also agreed to withdraw part of the mammoth economic package issued a year ago after the Brexit.
It will require time for the financial plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks as of the upcoming February, although it has been said that it is now expected that it will provide £15 billion more within the framework of this system - with £115 billion.
"" "minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said:" "" "in the central forecast of the MPC the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak at short notice, as the pressure on the real income of households continues to impair consumption." "" "" ""
"" "in the interest rates it repeated that" "" "a certain tightening of monetary policy" "" "would be required to cool inflation and a" "" "bigger" "" "extent than the markets expect." ""
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
"" "however, the bank emphasised that increases would be" "" "gradual" "" "and" "" "limited" "". "" ""
The Bank's growth forecasts, adjusted downwards for this and next year, are 1.9% and 1.7% projected in May.
It has maintained its forecast for growth of 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound dropped by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and dropped by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision for no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened the rise in interest rates and increased GDP in the second quarter of 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although the Bank will recover slightly towards the end of the year.
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households to be affected by rising inflation and marginal increase in salary as the tightening first becomes worse before it improves.
She added that in the coming years, monetary policy will not "avert" the income tax, but she added that wages will recover significantly at the end of her three-year forecasts.
The economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.
"" "" "" "the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.25% in the last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the sinking of the pound." ""
The Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until it will fully reach the prices and the economy.
Before the Bank's final decision on interest rates, the call for interest rates increased as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers demanding an increase of 0.5% in July.
Inflation decreased from 2.9% in June last month to 2.6% in June, although the bank said this was expected and will attract them over the coming months.
"" "the Bank said the exceeding in proportion to its goal of 2% was" "" "quite" "" "attributable to the weak pound." ""
"" "Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers said:" "" "in view of the recent return of the Swap installments, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as the lenders are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way." ""
"" "the market is particularly good for those with whom the existing deals are expiring and the new mortgages are closed, and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular." "" "" ""
NHS (National Health Service) is to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
"" "patients will receive access to a" "" "transformative" "" "HIV prevention treatment in September following a fight against the High Court against the financing of the drug in NHS." ""
NHS England announced that a Prep Prevention Prevention (prep), which was taken before the intercourse, can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, now being delivered by healthcare through a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to finance the trial after the Appeals Court confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court that the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep, despite the assertion that local authorities should fund him.
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England CEO Simon Stevens as an important new intervention, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as the "decisive moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to permit the registration of people, and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Prep Prevention (prep) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces HIV transmission in risk of infection.
To take prep before intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or as long as two hours prior to sexual intercourse.
Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In clinics, suitable participants are identified who agree to the study including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People living in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will sign £10 million and NHS England signed a contract for delivery of the drugs this week following an international competitive purchase.
The study aims to assess the full potential of prep by collecting clinical evidence, how it is systematically used, recorded and implemented on a large scale.
"" "Stevens said:" "" "this great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV." ""
"" "" "" "it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in dealing with one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity." "" "" ""
"" "Deborah gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said:" "" "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV." ""
Prep, when targeted towards needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many lives.
"" "we welcome this announcement." "" "" ""
"" "Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" "" "the priority must now be that the study is quickly carried out across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind." ""
"" "now that prep test medicine was obtained, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people." "" "" ""
"" "Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health, said:" "" "the beginning of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitating implementation by the government." ""
The evidence shows how transformative this drug may be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of prep.
"" "" "" "now it is important that this study is conducted as quickly as possible across the country to protect people infected with HIV and that it will contribute to a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society." "" "" ""
Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resized in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment.
It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it's proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
"before I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," Joanne says.
"" "" "" "I looked for something comparable to my price." ""
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.
"" "I fell in love with her and made an offer this day." "" "" ""
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot was completely overhauled.
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement, "she says.
For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.
"" "" "" "the steel work is quite complicated," "" "he explains." ""
"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend." ""
"" "it wasn't just about building a simple platform, but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""
This arrangement made it possible to place two rooms at full height above each other - with much additional drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille illumination set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work for longer.
In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.
Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Foldable kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"" "" "" "a little bit of engineering went inside," "" "explains Erfan of the reinforced, veneered MDF-door." ""
"" "" "" "it's important, so when you push the door, it glides very easily." "" "" ""
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and improved layout.
"" "" "" "at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued," "" "says Erfan." ""
"" "" "" "in a vestigial form, a real estate agent will enter and conduct a calculation based on the floor size." "" "" ""
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space while at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"" "" "" "the materials are the things that touch you and therefore help create an emotional attachment to a home," "" "says Erfan." ""
"" "" "" "you don't dearest into the electrical sockets in the walls." ""
"" "these are important, but they do not play with your heart." "" "" ""
It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of some standard in something quite amazing.
Indeed, as Joanne, you could decide not to leave this.
Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in a confrontation over one of the largest real estate imperialist Victorias worth more than $500 million.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and assets should be split.
Paul wanted to retire from family operations since 2014, but a sharp conflict about the separation takes place at the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers acquired 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood.
There, the Westco family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 to USD 85 million.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De LUTIS now encompasses offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt. Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs.
After an agreement with her dead father Colin - Paul describes as "principal operator and the dominant personality" in the De LUTIS family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.
A court record states that Colin owns property worth 316 million dollars and Paul worth $176 million.
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"" "" "" "the divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," "" "he wrote in 2015 in a first Affidavit." ""
Last Friday, after several failed attempts, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers now also struggle to control the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul asserts, has excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul to manage some possessions incompetent.
In an early affair, which was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"" "" "" "my Italian inheritance stipulates that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""
The costs rise in the case of hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held on both sides.
Mrs. De LUTIS and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran dairy and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first denim of the family.
Colin says he began Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De LUTIS says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to share her property to her sons.
"" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land before judgment," "" "she wrote." ""
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De LUTIS group of companies, whereas Colin claims that Mark paid $10 million and Luke 26 million when leaving the company.
"" "both Luke and Mark are, Paul says," "" "bitterness on the conditions of their financial separation." "" "" ""
Colin held back very well although he was a former AFL member of the board and after a biography of the year 2015 by Eddie McGuire, he was the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De LUTIS and their lawyers.
"" "only Colin answered by SMS to say" "" "I really can't say much" "", "because the case is in front of the courts." ""
"" "" "" "it is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and draw our surname through the courts," "" "he wrote." ""
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to meet his brother's demands.
"" "" "" "our father would not wish that Paul and I would end up in our current fight," "" "he said, adding that he" "" "still hope for a solution." "" "" ""
On Friday, this hope seemed to be over.
"" "" "" "our issue will be solved in the near future by the courts," "" "Colin wrote." ""
"" "" "" "the new Chief of Staff is planning to curtail the president's media abstinence." ""
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, it will be the first.
Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on an even more uniform course.
Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior officials on his first day of work, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trump White House, which he wanted to repair: poor information that was placed in the president's hands.
Kelly said to the staff that information should flow on him - whether on paper or briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information. "
Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring its media density.
President Trumpy's relationship with television reaches decades back - and now, wherever he is in the White House, his television commercials are still strong.
"" "" "" "if Trump was angry with unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were to convince," "" "said former electoral adviser Sam Nunberg in February against Politico." ""
"" "Politico Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keep the Twitter habit under control, according to six former electoral campaigns, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise." "" "" ""
Okay.
"" "but the idea that the Twitter habit was ever" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""
Perhaps these campaign officials do not know what we do not know others - that without their interventions, trumps would have contained even more combustibles.
We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.
If his employees were making it a few times to keep anger away from him, their efforts paid off.
But no one has consistently prevented the creation of Trump controversies.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, are trying to advance their own agenda by presenting trump material that could possibly promote their views from the world.
In May, Politico - dealing entirely with this story - reported about the preference of advisers to the president for strategic reasons without doubtful information.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react to negative press clippings like a volcano, especially those with damaged leaks, and find out where they come from." ""
This is exactly what happened at the end of February when someone had maliciously accused the president of a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a heap of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banished from Twitter for harassment or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and has revoked it.
"" "Trump read the article and began to question staff about Walsh." "" "" ""
"" "Goldmakers added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," "" "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork and to document the dump." "" "" ""
How did that work?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive for influence.
These unchangeable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.
Most sought-after criminals receive mail from Europol

Travelers negotiate a ditch and return to the 'Millionaire range'
Some of the wealthiest house owners in West Midlands are standing again with some resolute travellers on war feet, who have negotiated a trench drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
"" "the travellers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a prosperous road called Solihull, which is called the" "" "Millionaire Series" "". "" ""
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out in May without being deterred by a trench dug by the Council to prevent their seizures.
The tactful group found a gap in defense systems and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
"" "angry residents have urged the advice of Solihull, who said that it was" "" "useless to deal with the problem." "" "" ""
"" "an anonymous owner said:" "" "they moved there on Monday evening after they were sent to Bentley Heath where they threw stones on the passers-by." ""
"" "" "" "the Council must be compelled by shame to implement it, as it was useless when dealing with the problem." ""
The travellers were there in May, were moved and are now back again.
"" "more arrived yesterday evening, probably even more today." "" "" ""

From Birkenhof, Waldhotel Luise
"" "from the former Hotel Birkenhof, the" "" "Waldhotel Luise" "" "is located." ""
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.
These are good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also income from the tourist tax.
In autumn 2014, in view of the dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the county, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation to the district council, which provided controversial discussions.
The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not disputed at that time in the municipal council.
But above all Freudenstadt's Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and even then spoke of serious interested parties at the house.
He should be right.
The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
You will be called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been building shuttles in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renovation works are made.
The floors were torn out, ceilings broken down, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still much to do until March.
"it's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything should be redone in the Black Forest Style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
"" "everything should become" "" "nice" "" "later, as Thomas Scherer is expressing." ""
"we want to make a piece of jewellery."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities.
One does not want to position itself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an upscale downtown level, Scherer emphasizes.
The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide, Scherer explains further.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable at the hotel.
He has already conducted talks with OB Julian Osswald and director of the Tourism Director Michael Krause, so Scherer.
The city's performances are identical to those of the hotel group.
"we are on the same line."
Thomas Scherer doesn't want to define himself precisely after the investments have been made.
He pays less than a million euros, he reckons.
The external investments are also brought to the fore, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard, a large terrace develops, which will be accessible from the restaurant which is open to the public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."
Russia Affair: U.S. Special Investigator sets Grand Jury
In the Russia affair around US president Donald Trump, special genealogist Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury after a report.
The committee has resumed the work in recent weeks, writes the "Wall Street Journal" calling on people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper took the step as a sign that Mueller has widened and intensified his investigation.
The CNN broadcaster reported that there are already first summaries of the committee in connection with a meeting between the oldest son and a Russian lawyer.
Us intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of interfering with the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller examined whether there were agreements between the election campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation focused on several men who acted as advisers to the Republicans during the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller took a close look at more and more trumps as a private and business environment.
"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Investigator Trump went personally to the centre and investigate whether the president could possibly hinder the judiciary in the course of the affair." ""
The main task of Grand Jurys is to prove this evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether prosecution is to be charged.
Grand Jurys are therefore also called the Prosecutors.
Most of the time, they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases.
The procedure is always done behind closed doors.
The body can also be engaged by the public prosecutor in order to invite individuals to take an oath.
According to CNN, previous invitations have been issued which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People who were involved in the meeting were asked to testify, called it in the report.
In addition, they should provide documents.
Along with Trump Jr., Trump advisers and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his head-in-law, Paul Manafort, were in the conversation.
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the substitution shows that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he would act quickly.
"" "" "" "but it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charging of an indictment." ""
However, the suspension of the committee was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for president Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"" "" "" "the Russian history is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""
"" "the issue gives the democrats a chance to" "" "feel good" "" "because they have nothing else about which they can talk about." "" "" ""
His special advisor, Ty Cobb, explained in a statement that he did not know anything about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
But he also usually works in secret, he emphasised.
"" "the White House endorses all measures that expedite the work of the Special Investigator in a" "" "fair" "" "way." ""
"" "" "" "the former FBI chief James Comey said three times that it was not against the president." ""
One has no reason to believe that something has changed, so it continued in the statement.
Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.
"" "" "" "because of this rationality, accusations against Trump have become loud, he has obstructed the judiciary." ""
Comey said in June of a Senate committee, Trump has asked him to set up investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.
After the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees.
That sparked speculation as to whether Trump Mueller wanted to release Mueller.
Unlike an independent investigator of the Congress, such as the Watergate affair around the late President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the President's margins.
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.
There were two groups of republican and democratic senators on Thursday that the Special Investigators could no longer be released so easily.
Antarctica: gigantic iceberg drives in Antarctica
In the western Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg has been solved by the narrowly seven-fold size of Berlin from the ice shelf.
This was shared by the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener-Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
The Koloss, weighing over a trillion of heavy and 5800 square kilometres, is now driving to the north and will probably need two or three years until it has melted.
With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades.
There is no danger to human beings.
According to research data, the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear.
In total, however, for some 30 years there have been a series of unusual bursts of ice-snups in the region, writes the US research centre for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now broken colossus has been part of the Larsen-C-Schelslab so far.
Schelcowl swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It continues to grow further into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C-Schelslab is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this shelf life was disturbed by the balance of waxing and abstention a few years ago.
AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete ice shelf.
It is worth mentioning that the Larsen-C-Schelice shelf is also in danger, because the front edge has never dropped as far as it is currently.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and can be broken if a piece breaks down at a key point.
The melting of ice shelf and iceberg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and squeeze ice as much water as it produces after melting.
However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.
This could possibly increase sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).
According to AWI, Larsen-C-Schelslab is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica after AWI data with nearly 50,000 square kilometres.
At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks periodically.
"" "" "" "although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University." ""
"" "" "" "this is the most popular retreat since the beginning of records," "" "he also affirmed." ""
"" "scientists have argued whether the Larsen-C ice shelf will grow back or fall back in the long term and possibly collapse," "" "said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" "" "our models say that it will be less stable." "" "" ""
But this development will take decades.
Even if these researchers do not bring back the departure of this giant iceberg to climate change, many of the Antarctic Peninsula has fallen apart in recent decades.
This long skirt of the Antarctic stretches in the direction of South America.
According to the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The rise in temperature contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has been warming up around three degrees in the past 50 years and is counting on the areas where the temperature is the fastest.
CDU wants to make house arif at staff
Because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vacant jobs, the CDU demands to step out of the employers' association to become more attractive.
Only shortly before the summer break, 41 new jobs in the administration had penetrated 41 new positions.
More than 1,100 clerks and civil servants are working for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 trainees have had their first day of work.
The apprenticeships in the circle are obviously very much sought after.
Some 620 applications for the places to be presented this year were to be recorded.
Nevertheless, the group is still lacking personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
At present, there are still 50 unoccupied positions in the Mettmann district.
Among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as general administration forces.
The CDU would now want to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
"" "according to the request of the parties, the administration should" "" "develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development." "" "" ""
The aim is not only to cover short-term needs for skilled workers but to counteract the future-oriented application shortage.
The overall concept should orientate internally and externally, demonstrate concrete measures for cross-entry and include a training initiative, call for CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you did not know before.
Other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
"" "speech is from a real" "" "competition of public employers" "". "" ""
In addition, there is a high number of employees who retire from the service of disease or age.
"" "" "" "so it's high time for action so that there are no more places left unoccupied." ""
But Klaus-Dieter Fuhrmann, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the joint motion with his party.
He caused a bad surprise already in the circle day, when he publicly challenged the personnel costs and the other parties startled.
"" "" "" "people want all opportunities to be reviewed which allow an exit from the local employers' association." ""
"" "" "" "if we do not arrive at short notice to a satisfactory solution, the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county-affiliated cities - should aim for a" "" "Haustarif" "", "so peoples." ""
In this way the CDU is trying to pay better the employees and officials when it actually envisages the tariff for the public service.
The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money is only available if you move to a higher level, which is oriented towards professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years.
Only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act.
Last but not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendel and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little personnel.
Italy exacerbates the tone of NGO-migrants' lifeboats
"" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs who use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea, warned that they cannot continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations." ""
"" "" "" "if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can work," "" "said Home Secretary Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa." ""
Minnitis's warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat of the German aid organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their team had worked effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio's extensive allegations.
"for us, the salvation of human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone," the organisation said in a statement on the social media.
"" "" "" "we can only assess all accusations currently being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation." "" "" ""
"" "the Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of" "" "Youth Rettet" "", "the Iuventa, since October." ""
It is suspected that its crew will ship dinghy migrants to be delivered directly by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart for the ships to be used again.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file whose content was published by Italian media.
The occupation is suspected of overriding the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue missions in the area for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.
Under the Code of Conduct boats such as the Iuventa must first have an Italian police officer who supervises their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have previously agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring any "significant changes or disabilities" to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel laureate organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures in Italy had declined sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.
"" "" "" "in the last days, we started to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "said the Minister." ""
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to achieve Europe.
Ascents and Trials
"" "nine Weilermer Biker, the" "" "Berlin outpost" "" "and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the northern Pfalz for four days to enjoy trials and sights." ""
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The Burg- und Weinfest by Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
There were viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the Palatinate Forest and the upstream plains.
In between there were repeatedely longer climbs, for the long trials reward.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and the folk festival sausage market.
"" "again, a view point rested on the lookout spot, connected by" "" "flying" "" "trials and moderate ascents." ""
On the last two days many altimeters were announced again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refuges brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim the bikers inhaled saline saline in the open-air inhalatorium.
Neustadt was also controlled.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 metres altitude, the group had met the Pfälzer Wald from its best side - sporty and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga matches e-sport
Do the sports stars in the future sit in front of computer consoles, instead of sweating through the stadium racing at wind and weather?
Fact: e-sport has long been a serious business, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gades included.
"" "" "" "these have also recognised the first federal states that are increasingly involved in this field." ""
The beginning made the VfB Wolfsburg in 2015, followed by FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"" "" "" "we hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB," "" "says CEO Jochen Röttgermann." ""
"" "he is sure" "" "there are still several clubs rising on this train." "" "" ""
"" "the FIFA World Cup in London organised the first" "" "Interactive Club World Cup" "", "where the gamers of various clubs compete against each other next weekend." ""
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven are qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen meanwhile has consulted an agency for virtual football players.
"" "" "" "real football must deal with the 14 to 30 year olds in particular, that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future," "" "says the 52-year-old." ""
And: the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-athletes under contract, one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send to Asia only once a year.
What is it all about?
At E-Sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the soccer simulation FIFA will be contested at competitive level.
As in normal sports, long ago, leagues have become established in which the pros compete against each other.
And in the Asian Games in 2022 e-sport is already part of the official program.
But is it a proper kind of sport?
For many, the idea is certain to get used to.
Ingo Frobats has also dealt with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and showing many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classic sports such as increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical insight, and a fast response capability.
Professional gamers should exercise not only on the console, but also exercise their body and pay attention to the diet.
"" "" "" "the fitte player is a good player." "" "" ""
"" "but crawling also sees problems:" "" "doping is becoming more and more a topic." "" "" ""
Controls are difficult to perform on online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing.
The scientist emphasizes the high integrative effect of the E-sport.
The players are on the move internationally, that's like a big global family, because there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by the company advisory company Deloitte and the Federal Association for Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.
In 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsorship and large tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to be at EUR 130 million.
This is little against the 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundesliga.
"" "however, the e-sport" "" "is no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," "" "the Deloitte consultants write." ""
Many countries are already on the move.
Big markets are Asia and the USA, where ex basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and Baseball player Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the e-sports betting company Unikrs.
There is also a lot happening in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sport was introduced as a teaching subject, says Frobber.
In the Netherlands and in France, the soccer league associations, according to Dutt, are now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
"" "" "" "Germany is lagging behind in Europe," "" "says VfB board member Röttgermann." ""
Only to decay in nostalgia, and to clarify the old times, is no longer enough today.
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but at the same time align the company with the modern market.
"we live in a digital world," says Dutt.
"" "" "" "you can't stick to the fact that only football stays as it was." "" "" ""
Venison-eggs ade - The egg-alternatives for cooking and baking
In the meantime, almost all states have been affected by the scandal surrounding poisoned eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and all eggs were taken from the sale throughout Germany.
In the regiments only eggs are to be taken, which are demonstrably not containing fipronil.
Michelle Carter sentenced to suicide because of the lyrics Conrad Roy remembers
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years, because she encouraged her boyfriend through texts and calls to commit suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of their conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to probation.
Carter was convicted in June for the negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who took life on 13 July 2014.
"" "the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing:" "" "my family is uncomforting." ""
"" "my son was my best friend." "" "" ""
Carter was allowed to remain free until his appeal.
She had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream coloured blouse, Carter was standing there with tears in his eyes, with folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was convicted.
"" "" "" "her actions have changed Conrad Roy," "" "said the prosecutor to the court." ""
"" "" "" "she finished his life to make her own better." ""
"" "she took no responsibility," "" "she said." ""
"" "" "" "she showed no regret." "" "" ""
"" "but Carter's lawyer said it was a" "" "awful circumstance which they deplore." "" "" ""
"" "however, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find out that their" "" "age or maturity" "" "or mental illness have a significant impact on their actions." "" "" ""
A public prosecutor read a statement by Roys's mother Lynn Roy saying that there is "no day in which I do not spend the loss of my beloved son.
"" "I want him to be proud of me and how I move with everything. I try to be there for eternity in spite of all my pain that we will carry for eternity." "" "" ""
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "persecuted" by the realization that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or would be a aunt for his children.
"" "" "" "not having this single person with whom I was together every day since I was born, is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," "" "she said." ""
The case appears to be a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to urge another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from a carbon monoxide poisoning in a car in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to finish his life.
"" "" "" "jump up, spring from a building, I don't know, there are many ways," "" "she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was on vacation with his family." ""
"" "in the moments before his suicide, she wrote:" "" "you have to do it, Conrad" "" "and" "" "Everything you have to do is turn the generator on and you will be free and happy." "" "" ""
Judge Moniz said Carter's attention was sought by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by any press.
The case has shared the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for murder on her British roommate in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago.
"" "Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times:" "" "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison." "" "" ""
"" "Joshua Kimmich: learning from the new" "" "Mini-Lahm" "" "of FC Bayern" ""
That Joshua Kimber was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup is no accident.
The FC Bayern will win a big season to the Confed-Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, which looked at Joshua at once, even though the extra piece of clothing was very, very small.
But as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cups, of course no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer could be seen, he made the rush to his arm.
"the trainer did not announce it," said the Confed-Cup winner afterwards, after his first deployment as Bavaria-captain.
Good, the stand could have run better than at 0: 2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign from the coach could hint at me.
Not the eight year older Arturo Vidal had been chosen as a player guide in the C-Elf from youth players, devotees and especially from the holiday.
Sugar l is best distributed to those who want to keep a lot of people who want to keep you in a good mood.
Those who have been chosen to take the inheritance of Lahm can only use a little extra motivation.
Kimmich confirmed: "this is what you want as a player: take responsibility."
On Wednesday the 22-year-old flew over the field as a mini-Lahm.
To the right rear, that is his position, the white bandage did the rest.
And Kimmich sat in such a position as the one who can best take the helm in his hand.
He gave instructions, tried to direct the untrained troupe.
He had the look for the whole while many others were busy with himself.
Vidal's inability to replay his missing fitness (hardly collapsed); Renato Sanches pointed out to the devil to get out of the achievements of the Asia trip (also only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle do not fall negatively in their first appearance in the Bayern-Trikot.
After all, it worked very well.
Süle ran beside Kimmich, Rudy before the defense, both acted confidently.
The nameless Napoli storm was often difficult, and in addition Süle tried a few times in the game design.
"" "his colleague Rudy admittedly admitted that the result was" "" "not as we have hoped for." "" "" ""
But he also showed a good performance at his debut.
"" "game relocation, tempo change:" "" "for this style, I was also picked up." "" "" ""
As unusual as this Bayern-World is still for the new entrances, one sees in the connection to the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but six or seven interviews.
Kimber said goodbye to his new fellow players after a few crunchy statements.
"" "there he heard an interesting proposition from Süle:" "" "what is going on here I have already noticed." ""
"" "in Bavaria, you just have to win each game." "" "" ""
At least he doesn't have to teach the new one.
Alaba motivated ÖFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's most well-known footballer fell short of the game about Twitter and wished the ÖFB ladies all the best.
The Bayern-Legionnaire is a club colleague from ÖFB-Kapitänern Schnaderbeck and plucked with our Ladys.
The tweets of the Austrian football tournament of the year and champions league winner should be a special motivational syringe.
Our ladies might also need the famous Bavarian Dusel well.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Wirtschaft loges Wisdom speed
It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is shown after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region talk to T V enquiry from a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister.
Frank natus, Chairman of the Association of Trier Corporations (VTU), says, "Wissing addresses the needs of the economy that blocked Lemke all."
The biggest turnaround sees natus in infrastructure policy: the gap between the motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the priority list of the country.
This year the Ministry is hoping for a planning procedure until 2021 is supposed to stand construction law.
A role in the plans of the country is also alluding to the Westumgehung Trier, which stands in the urgent need of the national transport timetable.
The goal was to put the circuit into operation in December 2020, says Ministerial spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees in this sign a sign to support regional, but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier aims, as was suggested by Wissing, to produce a Rhineland-Palatinate-Label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German exports falling for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company, praise the Chamber of Commerce.
The Handwerkskammer Trier sees in the new Master Bonus an additional incentive for young apprentices, says managing director Matthias Schwalbach.
A bonus of 1000 euro is planned for the passed master test and 2500 Euro, if graduates are self-employed within ten years after the master's training.
But the homework list for the country remains long.
At the planned road construction, facts are to be created quickly, at the same time it lacks the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, chief executive officer of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier.
Only 29 positions have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to employ Wissing at the state-run mobility.
The Chamber of Industry calls for more jobs to be allocated to external offices.
Christian Baldauf, CDU vice-president, points to calculations of the Court of Auditors, the country investing more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018.
In addition, Frank natus is also expecting a concept of the country as it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
Further broadband expansion in the country is also sobering.
In 2016, regional companies only rated the grid supply in an IHK survey only with a score of 3,4.
They complained about stagnant Internet connections and quarries.
Ex-Minister for Economic Affairs, Eveline Lemke, is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green faction left Lemke for April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where after four months of inconsistencies it cleared the field again.
Audi has to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter-reaction
One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW leader said that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," and moved to European cities - including Munich where BMW is located - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the undertaking as a recall.
European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations.
But nitrogen oxides which emit diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The costs for car manufacturers, systems for neutralizing the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles, also increase what makes it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of losing the powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.
The companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called write-off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but to return to normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees were indicted, others are being examined on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was expanded.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could seriously strain Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer greatly contributes to Volkswagen's profit.
This message has the raft on Saturday at the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order for the Isar visitors to participate, a raft goes to Munich on Saturday, which has a special message.
If there is again on Saturday the Isar, there will be a big raft between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And this is not a common raft, with Isar-tourists.
But the Construction Department wants to clarify.
On the raft one sees a large infotransparent.
It shows a garbage mountain.
The kick-off to an outreach campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
"" "with the motto" "" "True Love" ""... "the understanding of the Isar should be sharpened as a desirable wild flow." ""
Last summer the raft sailed over the Isar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillos Knoll's noses and the laughter of the suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most publicized cartoons, the nostrils of his characters are his trademark.
Even with 85, the Argentineer still draws and works on a film.
"" "his message: laugh," "" "for there is too much suffering in the world." "" "" ""
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrant in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, he suggested himself as a draftsman for congratulating cards - which frustrated him.
"" "" "" "the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," "" "he said once." ""
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match," and then in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, roundish Mordillo figures tumble in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning he is still sitting at the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
Over calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, plush toys and clocks still find its funny characters wide spread worldwide.
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a jack-of-all as a counterpart.
For the first time, his figures show in the 3D film, which is to come to the cinema screen in 2019.
"" "" "" "I don't know exactly what they will say, it's strange for me," "" "says Mordillo." ""
The script is not written by him.
This is why he relies more on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced without a word.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is declining because of the conditions which are reminiscent of drought and due to diseases transmitted by scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, causing great headaches.
Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively at risk, because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.
"" "there is also a small iccade, a micro-bacterium, which transfers the Little Gocleiades, and in the case of very dry weather, there are many of them." "" "" ""
And there is much on the game.
Lavender oil not only attracts tourists, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
"" "so we have fewer parts with essential oil." "" "" ""
The solutions considered include a better distribution of water and the slowdown of evaporation from the soil, but also spraying plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The small town of Geisa in the Thuringian border is celebrating its 1200th anniversary this year.
Festhöhning Point is this Saturday and Sunday with a Medieval festival.
Shoppers, guilds, dealers, vagabonds or a landing place should be experienced in the city centre these days.
The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly Rijeka are usually meeting wednesday in order to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the State of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-level journalists are discussing what feels safer: they should take their children into the office, which in 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.
They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government's salary list or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no break from violence, and while throughout the country the bodies are piling up, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are following attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven states this year.
Among the latter is her editor and her inspirer of Rijeka, co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "Valdez also wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""
His absence is felt deep, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hanging on the facade of the Rijeka building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.
Although a German Federal Attorney General was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, the Committee for the Protection of Journalists only launched two criminal proceedings.
As with most thousands of murders linked every year to drug trafficking and organised crime, journalists are rarely brought to justice by journalists.
At Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting and even though the terrain is still more treacherous.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefit, says Ibarra.
"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why, we distrust everybody." "" "" ""
In the morning of 15 May, Valdez moved the office of the newspaper Rijeka to the capital of Culiacan.
He managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with "Twelve River."
The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it close.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a wife and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.
But on the topic of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of adorned, two-storeyed mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" if only a cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.
Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken by guilt that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival card fractions in the war with Guzmans sons.
This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected gang members bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own security after the confiscation of another newspaper publishing the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing was considered a milestone in Mexican aggression against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for the Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues for the establishment of Rijeka and sold 50 US dollars.
"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug poison problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising grew.
Reporters liked to be able to publish hard-fitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the establishment of Rijeka, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for their coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award 'of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists for his courage in prosecuting the Mexican drug story wherever she was leading.
He willingly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
"" "" "" "drug trade in Sinaloa" "" "is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." ""
"" "" "" "you must take on the task that you like as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb." ""
"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what did you do in the face of so many dead... why didn't you say what was going on?" "" "" ""
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun-bird, who could curse like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: was his love for routine his destruction?
His death forced them to question their own assumptions about how they best carry out their work and stay alive.
"" "" "" "they don't like to deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways and runways to move drugs." ""
"" "" "" "these things were not allowed," "" "said Bojorquez." ""
The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells bad, stay away from it.
"" "the trouble is, the editor of the Rijeka Andres Villarreal said that" "" "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened with Javier." "" "" ""
The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggled smuggled, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is changing constantly.
In the room where staff from Rijeka met for safety training, there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed. days before it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Rijeka in a four-storey building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves if these officers were among the 50 percent of the policemen who the governor was not trustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For the issue of this week, Rijeka has spent three main stories.
There was the assassination of the brother of the former famous xer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government spending, focusing on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group that was in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, led through a kidnapping.
There was no official word on who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knows: that the restaurant is a favorite pub of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was recorded under the name of a politician who belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled almost all the political levels almost the entire century.
Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this pub, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, the readers would have viewed the column of Valdez as the most informed source of abduction.
"" "" "" "before we had known what happened," "" "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" "" "El Flaco" "" "because of his slender body keyboard." ""
"" "" "" "now all communication channels are broken with our sources." "" "" ""
Valdez's office became a storage room for notes and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped up a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning for another journalist for the office of the prosecutor.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan.
A burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA testing that it is its.
Journalists all over the country have become louder by writing down in organized protests "SOS Press" on pavements and buildings.
On that day, director Bojorquez goes away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and killing them because they told the truth.
She has since asked for her to be re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
"" "Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were" "" "surrounded" "" "by organised crime, government officials and an indifferent society." ""
In his last book "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime.
"" "last year, the Media Wächtergruppe" Articulo 19 "" "" has assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials. "" "
"" "" "" "in Mexico you die because they want you to keep the mouth," "" "said Ramirez." ""
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
"" "her body was found together with a note signed by the Zetas Kartell:" "" "here I am because of my reports." "" "" ""
A computer keyboard and headphones were located next to their head.
Some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do as El Manana did in Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of its director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the title page with the title "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even from the country.
It is a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it seems to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who, together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, was murdered three months after the flight from Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue working, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade scares him.
"" "" "" "Mexico goes to hell, so I became a reporter," "" "he said." ""
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue was finished, the editors of Rijeka sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones began to hum.
A number of shootings with rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region.
From the curb edge you have published the news on the website of Rijeka via mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens howled nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez threw a glance at the policemen who kept guard to see if they were in readiness.
If they were afraid, they didn't show it.
Under the mighty portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for all of Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his tracks.
"" "" "" "how can you just think about it," "" "said Bojorquez," "" "when the day Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send them to the street." "" "" ""
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid its enemies
At first sight it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening one.
Researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian miner have been preserved so well that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."
"" "it was so good that they could even notice that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had had something of a" "" "troubled past" "". "" ""
"" "the report in the journal" Current Biology "" "" described him as "" "" the best-preserved dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world. "" "" "" "
The fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurier, living in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years.
His unbelievably well preserved condition has amazed researchers who describe it as "truly remarkable."
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivorous is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk, when he founded the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.
He met something that seemed missing from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely.
The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal in the 2500 pound (1.100 kg) of heavy earth clots.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"" "" "" "if you only blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," "" "said the chief author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen." ""
"it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurier."
Researchers found out that this herbivorous, although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, was probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as a counter-burial, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed him to get better in his surroundings and to avoid his enemies, say experts, suggesting that it has been threatened by bigger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines in May and is now in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markwithchelli according to the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to discover it carefully.
The amazing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered the counter shading, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although the countershading is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the animals today living.
It points out that the dinosaurs were hunted by dinosaurs eating enough pressure that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use the counter shading - think of roe deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, which signalizes that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.
"" "" "" "strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs prey must have been," "" "Brown said." ""
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about his life, including his preserved intestine, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and pushed out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the seabed.
At this time Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans are probably more widespread inland than they are today.
"this Nodosaurier is truly remarkable, because it is completely covered with conserved scaly skin but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," Brown said.
"" "" "" "the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early Cretaceous period." ""
"" "you don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just squint a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is asleep." "" "" ""
The Cretaceous period was a time when huge thermal diodes, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.
To this belongs the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mumified in mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he buried at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from muzzle to hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch long tips that hung from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored herbivorous was swept through Western Canada, until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the underwater cremation of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail.
The petrified remnants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains cover still bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur
"" "as Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is" "" "rare as a win in lotto." "" "" ""
The more I approach it, the more confusing it becomes.
Petrified remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates bearing the skull of the animal.
His right front foot rests on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
"" "I can count the scales at his sole." "" "" ""
In the thunderstorm: mass wreckage on A8: many wounded
Violent accident on Thursday evening at the A8: just under 30 vehicles are involved in a mass collision.
There are numerous wounded, kilometres long roads - and Gaffer.
Around 20 people were injured on the Autobahn in Stuttgart-Munich (A8) on Thursday afternoon.
According to the first indications of the police, between the junctions of Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm almost 30 vehicles, among them probably trucks, crashed into one another.
The exact number of injured parties first did not provide any information.
"" "" "" "it is a matter of light to moderate injuries," "" "said a police spokesman." ""
A large array of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.
The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.
In the direction of travel Munich was a round ten kilometres long back-stau.
As reported by an AZ reporter, it also came on the opposite rail to massive disabilities - through numerous Gaffer.
The fire brigade reported the car drivers' registration plates, which now have to be reckoned with sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 18: 45 o'clock a second accident happened on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a passenger car.
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: group tests "comfort check-in"
It is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: unsuspecting you are sitting in the train and sleeping.
Or one is deepened in his work and has just a brilliant mind.
And then: buffered.
If the conductor comes and wakes an unsuspected, or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket control.
You simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and thus validate your ticket.
Currently, a test run is running on two tracks.
"" "" "" "if the offer arrives, we expand it." ""
"" "it is expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany in the beginning of next year," "" "said a railway narrator." ""
"" "" "" "comfort check-in" "" "calls the train ticket devaluation without Schaffner." ""
In order to be able to use this, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.
And you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do anyway.
It is also necessary to buy the DB Navigator app, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway.
And finally, you need a seat reservation.
"" "because the" "" "comfort check-in" "" "works like this: you go to the train, call his ticket at" "" "My Tickets" "". "" ""
The test customers then have a button for the electronic devaluation.
The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passengers X is in the train and took the booked seat Y.
When the train companion arrives at the ticket inspection at Place Y, he knows that a passenger is sitting there with an already validated online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, continue working, keep silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers.
"" "" "" "if you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train cabin crew, simply check in the DB Navigator yourself." ""
"" "this allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal," "" "says Michael Peterson, DB Fernverkehr's marketing management board." ""
"" "second plus:" "" "and our employees have more time than today to respond to their individual customer needs." "" "" ""
Those who often travel by train know that alongside delays and missed trains, ticket inspections are among the biggest offences.
Because often one has, in any case, one of the fellow travellers does not have all the documents that one needs to devaluation of online tickets.
Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to show is missing.
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passenger, which leads to a bad mood in the evenings or large space and delays in controlling their own ticket and the conductor at the end takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And this applies only to ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
"" "" "" "other newcomers on the same track are not yet unlocked." ""
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.
Only one day after she arrived in New York City, she sat in St. Louis Giorene on the bed of an airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled over a post from someone from the High School.
"" "" "" "the police have just killed an 18 year old child, and it is still on the streets," "" "said the police." ""
Confused as nobody else posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly on their timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was to tweeter the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., live.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street and staying there for four hours.
"" "" "" "that's wild," "" "said Ferrell." ""
But death was nothing new for them and their community.
She stopped her cell phone in order to return later in the evening to Tweets about people on the Canfield-Drive.
"" "there were photos of the police band and people shouting, and of a man claiming to be Browns father who wore a sign with the inscription:" "" "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!" "" "" ""
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman secured his gun and shouted, "I'll kill you... Animals all."
"" "" "" "this is not common," "" "recalls Ferrell." ""
"" "" "" "this is not the type of murder we have gotten used to and which we can call typical." "" "" ""
At that moment, I felt chills.
"" "I was angry and wept." "" "" ""
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would ride to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary, Whose Streets?, "in the cinemas from November 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience, which consists of the view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a flower-dress and a fitting crown, the two discussed a conversation that they had "over the black experience and the black state countless times before this morning."
"" "" "" "you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "she remembered what she said." ""
"" "" "" "we are now going to Ferguson, because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right." ""
"" "I couldn't take it away," "" "said Ferrell later." ""
"" "" "" "what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past." ""
It must know it and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black Constitution, and what we need to do to free ourselves.
Even if I am fortunate enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women's child.
"" "I feel that I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it." "" "" ""
The first station, when they arrived at Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of officers Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for heel shape.
"my activism changed completely after 9 August," she said, and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis Presidency of the minority student Nurse Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
"" "everything has come." "" "" ""
Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.
"" "Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to" "" "document" "" "what happened." ""
One question raised Ferrell in mind: "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"
This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often white people - in a community benefiting from their pain and their resilience.
"" "as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "" "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to make it different." "" "" ""
Folayan had already collaborated with the co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todebecke inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of Whose Streets? "in the years after Brown's shooting.
"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks with us. we're talking," Davis said.
"" "" "" "that was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, for so I will be represented." "" "" ""
The goal was not to concentrate on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - it turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film.
As a result, documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, as she fell in love with her wife.
"" "" "" "I felt like naked," "" "said Ferrell, laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time." ""
"" "" "" "but I have understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people." "" "" ""
In addition, Ferrell's history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement who shaped the film "Blacklive Matter" in social media after the killing of the black teenager, Trayvon Martin, identified themselves as gay.
"" "" "" "black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement together," "" "said Ferrell," "" "and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts." ""
"" "black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything." "" "" ""
"" "Folayan agreed to note that" "" "the movement is really held by black women and many black women." "" "" ""
"" "however, it insists that" "" "this is not an affirmatized type of action," "" "when heel was selected as the heart of the film due to their identity." ""
"" "" "" "she was the person who shook this energy," "" "she said." ""
"" "" "" "it is no accident, although it was at the forefront, because in a life at these junctions as a black, gay woman stands so much at stake." ""
"" "you can feel their energy through the screen." "" "" ""
In the meantime, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial lines between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos."
Nevertheless she clings to a song and she feels bound to this memory since she went to the street three years ago in Ferguson.
"" "" "" "it is our duty to fight for our freedom." ""
It is our duty to win.
We have to love and support each other.
"" "we have nothing to lose - except our chains." "" "" ""
From "Dream" to "megalomania": TV-readers discuss about bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people even though they are not built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping mall at the south end of the pedestrian precinct has been split by supporters and opponents since the first presentation of 2009.
Cold leaves the subject hard.
"" "the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page" "" "Volksfreund Bitburg" "". "" ""
"" "while one can say to the bit gallery:" "" "that would be a dream" "" "(Anja Becker) or" "" "that would be real great" "" "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" "" "don't need a person" "" "(Siggi Betzen) or quite simply:" "" "megalomania!" "" "(Lars Scholz)." ""
While the proponents are building a gallery more customers move into the city, from which the other businesses benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the plot on which the farmers market hall is located, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.
This will end with the beginning of the construction work.
The Gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Beda-Platz with the possibility to sit outside.
"" "Simone Zimmer:" "" "for many years now, we have been selling almost every week in the farmer's market hall." ""
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women always very happy again.
We also discovered the butcher's shop for us.
We would like that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.
In other cities there is also.
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "
Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery will settle, depends on the amount of rent.
"" "but this should not be low in the new project." "" "" ""
Eva Kilic: "why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether it's clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets, I think that's superfluous.
There is plenty of that in our city.
You can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years.
But since there is not even a weekly market place, it is even more important that at least the market hall remains intact.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive.
As you can see, shop shops are rented in a shopping mall only by larger companies, because the mids there are often not portable for a retailer.
"" "too bad, special deals are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear." "" "" ""
Wolf Fandel: "a mall with a market hall fits me not together.
And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.
Above all: where should the farmers market hall look like during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes eventually.
Or does the Gespenst Bit gallery already manage to sell all the shops in Bitburg? "
George Marquet: "that simply won't work.
And there's no need for a shopping center that's empty.
In my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery.
But thanks to the unbelievably many - as I can find - there is no room for senseless construction projects in Bitburg for a farmer's market hall.
When the farmers market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again. "
A fitting similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks-tuppers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after having publicly launched diplomatic reports on WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is named A Becoming resemblance.
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline singled out her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and groundbreaking dissident, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he only had three days in his office.
According to the algorithmic analysis of DNA, which was extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits, as someone with these genomic data could look like, a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual commentary was created not only in the form of DNA data - the many ways they interpret and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.
Her picture was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie, sitting visibly uncomfortable on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum blonde wig - with whom she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was just hit by the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In this the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts like cigarette stub and chewing gum, extracting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people might look.
This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"" "" "" "they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "" "explained Dewey-Hagalla at a press preview of the new exhibition." ""
And she could not visit at that time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her jailed muse were turned into unequal letters, which in the course of two years exchanged several letters.
"" "they even created a comic" "" "Suppressed Images" "" "illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the President of Chelsea would transform judgment and she would be able to personally see the exhibition." ""
That Obama really was only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas would be a welcome form of happy coincidence.
There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweezable ways to further inflame the rigid splits he was supposed to fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things she said that "things happen for a certain reason."
In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning concluded with her oversized signature underneath (the "i" in her surname is equipped with a heart) an end of "automatic fragmentation" whose basis sex, race, sexuality and culture have been. "
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
With the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), Dewey-Hagalla had hoped to show how astonishingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"what people hope to take with it is that our genome is not responsible for who we are and how openly genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also visible.
"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are." "" "" ""
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic book.
She shows Manning how she emerges with a hands-free hands from the disciplinarian tanks of the United States such as King Kong.
"" "" "" "when they put down your speech, they have won," "" "he said." ""
"" "" "" "so never stop the mouth." "" "" ""
"" "" "" "it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "" "said the artist who greeted me from Philadelphia." ""
"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it, it will be welcomed in the middle of space by the masks, from their own genomic simulations, which gather like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition until the size (5 "2, Manning Stature), where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg on the portraits.
"" "" "" "I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind her liberation." "" "" ""
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee at Oxford University because of murder
A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at the University of Oxford who are looked for as suspects after a man had been stabbed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued arrest warrants for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as evidenced by the files of the Cook County Local Court.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several bites.
A joint warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the corpse was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still found dead at the scene of the event, and detectives examine the stitches as murder, while the police actively seek the two suspects, said officials.
Since 2007, Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice-president of university relations, said in an e-mail explaining that it had now been certified and excluded from entering the Campus of Northwestern University.
"" "" "" "this is now a criminal case examined by the relevant authorities, and Northwestern University co-operates in this investigation," "" "said Cubgage." ""
Warren is senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
"" "a spokesman of the University and Somerville college told in an email that" "" "we are in contact with the police in the UK and are prepared to help the US investigative authorities in any way possible." "" "" ""
The statement also added that Warrens' colleagues were shocked and want him to be.
"" "" "" "chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urges the suspects to face the authorities." ""
"" "" "" "the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them reinforce," "" "said Guglielmi." ""
"" "" "" "Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities will help to find suspects." ""
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip that said that something happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27th.
It was confirmed by security cameras that they were in the building.
"" "" "" "we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," "" "said Guglielmi." ""
The management team at Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents: "the police are currently working on the victim's timeline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"" "" "" "we will conclude the WADA roadmap in the near future" "" "- Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko" ""
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency (RUSADA).
"at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in co-operation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
"" "the WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect," "" "said Mutko on Thursday." ""
The PM commented on the second part of WADA's schedule to comply with the code, which describes the criteria for reestablishment of RUSADA and recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.
"" "" "" "everything has been announced, everything is being implemented." ""
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future, "he added.
One of the criteria listed in the list, however, states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the results of the investigation approved by the WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to publicly subsidized doping in Russian sports.
"" "referring to the matter, mutko said:" "" "we carry out the investigation as our anti-doping system has made a mistake." ""
All measures have been implemented.
"" "but there were no government programs, and we won't admit anything that does not exist." "" "" ""
Mutkos words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
"" "in conversation with the Russian sales agency rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov made problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, then added:" "" "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations." ""
"" "nobody has to accept this report unconditionally," "" "added Smirnov." ""
RUSADA was banned in November 2015 by the Doping scandal of the WADA by conducting doping checks in Russia.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After visiting the Moscow headquarters in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA "moved in the right direction" to be used again.
Aldi does not sell eggs for the time being
These divided the company groups.
It was a mere precaution, it could not go further from any health impairment, it was said in the message.
From now on only eggs can only be supplied to Aldi, which have been proven to have been tested negative on fipronilateral Anti-Luttering.
Aldi wanted to create clarity and transparency with his customers.
The Start-ups that will help your company not to become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the luck with your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.
Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - deceptive.
And even if you promised anonymity some workers did not mourn the process.
"there was never any consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.
It has called people from outside for help.
A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is at the waxing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to perform surveys, offer specific groups and demographic groups, employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases, whistleblowers allow to bypass the C-Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors.
"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with GLINT.
In addition to the Snap-Polls and Surveys from certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low tuned results - so that you can post, why.
Companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you are not the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken were punished.
For start-ups like GLINT, this wish is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion by 2020, following the financial technical site Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the Uber-Fall in Misskredit.
Cent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered as a client.
As GLINT, Convercent will send you tailor-made "Pulse" Surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows staff to report bad behavior.
And when the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"public opinion polls the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.
If a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences by consumers boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has employed Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.
Now that the company uses Convercent, problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed faster - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices.
"" "" "" "I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience of employment," "" "said Vitrano, who runs the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday." ""
"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes." "" "" ""
Companies began to take Ethics, Values and Employees Commitment in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
"" "but it took until the" "" "social media came to their right" "" "that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry went online." ""
"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""
Both GLINT and Convercent offer your software as a service, and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.
"" "" "" "it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups." ""
Cent received $10 million in funding in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.
Glistening secured $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes.
The staff want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"" "" "" "if people are happy to be in a company that is their votes and that the work they do is worthwhile, they feel more committed to making this company successful," "" "said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and GLINT." ""
Investors gain reputation when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.
If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase engagement and deployment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important.
But the data is useless if the caretakers of a company do not take action.
In fact, if a company asks staff for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if the Shift is not fast enough or not at all, it can grow disappointments and demotiate employees.
"" "" "" "if you ask for 4.000 ideas, you must be prepared to have 4,000 talks," "" "said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data." ""
"" "" "" "for if you don't follow, staff will ask," "" "Have you really heard me?" ""
Do you care about it?
"" "and if you don't care, why should I?" "" "" ""
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported about GLINT, so Errett.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize multiple teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.
In Ruby Tuesday, the company will always get new insights into the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better retention of employees in an industry that is well-known for high turnover.
"if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"" "" "" "and if you lose people, you also lose customers." ""
And if you lose customers, you will lose companies.
The NCAA removes the two-day practices and makes a long day for the fry
It starts at 23 o'clock when a lot of UCLA footballers chat on one side of the new training fields of the team on campus.
Some withdrew their jersey tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes are a lunch break.
Players who are enrolled at the Summer Courses will return to their final audits after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Waterman Football Center next morning at 6: 30 p.m.
"" "" "" "this is a real treadmill for the boys for the next three days," "" "said Bruzin-Trainer Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday." ""
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden of players, and they have actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three training sessions of the UCLA should start at 7: 15 p.m. in order to meet the already fully packed schedule of the players.
The compromise between the two days is more than a day when the Brotherhood moved the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school, for the first time during Moras, six times in Westwood performed practical exercises.
They are supposed to hold 18 exercises over the course of August. 20 before the start of formal play preparations for their prelude to Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supports the change of the NCAA, even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players.
"" "" "" "we put this enormous strain on them three or four days, and it's very challenging," "" "Mora said." ""
"" "" "" "and they simply pushed through, they are moving on, they are great people." ""
I think once we get to Saturday and we have more time, it will really be great. "
UCLA will finish its practices as soon as the camp is terminated, which will be no easy task in view of the clear line of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the upscale class that has already cleared a safety net behind a gate post.
Broker players should occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season.
"" "" "" "we will use our security," "" "Mora said." ""
"" "" "" "this is a real problem, and it is not far fetched to think that people are renting a room there and then set up to record an exercise." ""
If you have the video tape of an exercise, it's a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking 8.
We will do the best with what we have.
That's why I don't worry too much.
We have a plan. "
Facebook wants to intensify facts-review in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third parties and display their results under the original contribution, the world's largest online social network on Thursday said. it is one of his efforts to fight so-called fake news.
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false notifications and send them to factants that may display results of the fact inspection from the original article.
Facebook has been criticised as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe they have also influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential elections.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May, and Germany supports a plan to be punished after social media networks, if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings as before elections in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany, a test of the new facts inspection was started.
"" "" "" "in addition to the knowledge, which stories of factual proverbs are challenged by third parties, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," "" "said Sara Su, Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog." ""
She added that Facebook still will be testing his feature on the "related article" and works on other changes to his news feed to reduce false news.
Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England
In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980's.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Irl River Valley in Kent and is now a inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a cosmopolitan Yorkshire man with a preference for historical documents.
"" "" "" "I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," "" "he says wistfully." ""
"" "" "" "what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand." "" "" ""
'A Castle in England 'covers the time from the Middle Ages through to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. each story has been illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Herzog iewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes that is based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotionally.
"" "" "" "I only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double-agent in the 1700" s working for the Jacobins, "" "" he says. "" "
"this is his thumb print!
And letters always smell like smoke, because at that time a fire lit up because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he himself is there.
Oh, I love archives! "
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have a little overvalued") all this seems too beautiful to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trench.
He wandered through the site and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscaping, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
"" "then, at night he drank" "" "Whiskey" "" "and began to write." "" "" ""
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown as the National Trust received full access until 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees began to look after the archives, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said," Oh, throw it on the attic. "
Diaries, letters from the time of English Empires, cards that represent what he had: "you could think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch fighting for the two families.
Guys, let everything go its way! "
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse themselves in the English history, including 'The Labourer', who follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"there is a record of an upheaval that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes.
"" "" "" "the uprising started in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start." ""
"" "maybe they are joined together?" "" "" ""
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Jesuit painter, who hid the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell is presented from the 18th century, who produced his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was dug up).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney: "the masters seemed to be quite gay, always making debts and spending money on things they could not afford.
"" "other generations of Darrell-men blew their debt crisis by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking guys, with a talent to recruit" "". "" ""
After the end of his deployment in the castle, Rhodes is searching for other unique writing experiences
He has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"" "" "" "I was sorry to go back," "" "he says." ""
"" "it was like" "" "Ah, now I have to deal with the damned life again." "" "" ""
Campaign launched: over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf covered
With the opening of the 301 year old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the City of Bad Honnef started their campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand (Rundschau from Thursday).
Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret until Thursday.
At the end of August there will be a feast on the island Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"too nice for us.
"" "or?" "" "asked the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorf chapel." ""
"" "" "" "we don't really think this (of course!)," "" "she wrote on her website yesterday." ""
"" "" "" "but we use this measure to attract your attention." ""
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems.
"" "basically, we are convinced that as a bad Honnef citizens, we are very well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city." "" "" ""
"" "when it comes to action, more than" "" "just" "" "a logo and a slogan, it continues." ""
"" "" "" "it is important to formulate an all-inclusive promise, one that gives the city a distinctive unique selling proposition." "" "" ""
Finally, she is competing with other communities.
The City of Bad Honnef will pay a mid-five-figure amount to its new umbrella brand and the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirees and promotions in the officer corps.
So this week too.
At first sight a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff, as before, but in the Prime Minister's office.
Under the head of the government, the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Ministers took part in the consultations.
As a result, the civilians in the YAS were in the over number.
The government tightens the reins in the military.
The Chief of Staff, Hulusi Akar, remains in office but the commander of the army, the Air Force and the Navy have been dismissed.
Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan 169 fired the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged ties to the movement of the Exile Preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as the wirepuller of the coup attempt.
Against 486 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt will be acting in Ankara for this week.
"" "already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the coup attempt as" "" "God's gift" "", "because he gave him the opportunity to" "" "completely clean up the armed forces." "" "" ""
But does Erdogan really have the army under control?
At the end of February, the "Hürriyet" newspaper published an article entitled "Unease in Military Headquarters."
"" "in the general staff there are concerns about increasing" "" "Islamization" "" "of the army, which, among other things, manifests itself in the repeal of the head ban on soldiers, wrote the paper." ""
In any case, the major involvement of the army and the security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan had a decree firing more than 7395 heads of state, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as if Erdogan tamed the military.
The generals were sooner than the actual masters of the country.
Three times they appealed to their role as custodians of the secular state order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed the power of the military step by step, not least by calling on the reform targets of the European Union.
Former officers say that Erdogan is driving forward an Islamisation of the armed forces.
"" "in the magazine" "" "Vocal Europe" "" "a particular non-respected officer sought asylum after the coup attempt out of fear of persecution abroad, the Turkish army will be" "" "full of extremists and Salafists" "" "in a few years." ""
If this is true, such a development could not leave Nato cold.
In any case, after the purgations, there is doubt that there are doubts about the preparedness of the Turkish army.
"" "the management structures and operational skills are" "" "weakened" "", "say Nato diplomats." ""
Washington changes the rules for Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, cited by the media.
It envisages the reduction of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress.
"" "" "" "this law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do this by changing the way citizens from other countries will issue green cards." "" "" ""
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
"" "this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy," "" "said Trump, quoted by the American media." ""
Ministry wants to rehabilitate circuit for road safety shuttle
Again and again over the past few months over the future of the race-race-shuttles has been fought - now it is to go very fast.
Even before the end of the year, the railway line on which the tourist train is going to be built will be built.
In order to secure the long-term future of the race-breaker, according to the Ministry of Transport, construction work on the track is to begin this year.
"with the decision to further order and renovate the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this important connection," declared State Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
He estimated the cost of repairing the track to about 2.5 million euros.
Of this sum, the country surpasses 75 percent.
The contract, on which the shuttle is to be ordered also in the future from the country, is currently being finalized, explained Sühl.
The Ministry and the Southern Thuringia railway as operators are already in agreement on the technical details.
"" "" "" "this means that the roadmap, vehicles used and quality standards are traded," "" "said Sühl." ""
The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years.
As a result, the Rennsteig-Shuttle should be ordered regularly in December 2017.
"" "the" "" "Rennsteig-Shuttle" "" "is a rail link that is popular especially for tourists between the stations Ilmenau and Rennsteig." ""
Over the past few months, a pilot plant has been tested to determine whether the route is used by a large number of people to order them regularly in the future.
The track is also strongly coloured in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
Just as you thought it won't be even more crazy in 2017, there's a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yes, actually.
Sex robots are currently a big deal.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking their ascension seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
"" "" "" "people make fun of it, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them more often," "" "Mr. Sharkey said in the publication of his new report." ""
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adjust" his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot via the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
"" "but it becomes even more worrying as many robots have the" "" "personalities" "" "that would make a steppe-woman look progressive." ""
Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there's the Roxxxy gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of timidity and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible," "" "says True Companion's website." ""
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
In the course of the day, it also has its moods - just like real people!
"" "it can be tired to be fixed on conversation or it can be" "" "in mood" "" "!" ""
There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape, if one goes one step on Frigid (means here: reluctant) Farrah, restless one the most.
On its website True Companion Roxxxy was compared with a vibrator, but for men.
"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?" is it on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just just another sex toy.
Their formation and their increasing refinement point to something more dense and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.
Most men, of course, will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR remembers their rising popularity they still remain on the verge of consumer culture.
But what transpires from the marginal zones can be very instructive in relation to the spirit of time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.
However, there is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time where women's rights are threatened all over the world, in which there is a president in the White House who boasted women being sexually assaulted.
The most frightening aspect of the TV series' The maid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the entwined body and the eyes out, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap.
The aim behind these sex robots is to establish a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).
Their constructors want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.
"" "but, brought to the point when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots are not real women." ""
They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.
They have no communication or background story, nothing that suggests independence or anything that might disturb the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are bogus slaves.
Or to put it in the statement of 2017: maid service
Pumps great performance?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of a healthy human mind
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized US voters have also split families in small format.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving Day there were newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horrors of Trump-Choosing relatives.
We are all trying to make our filter bubbles burst.
Less noted is the power of mumps to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.
It reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House everyone whom she knows, including the republican relationship with which she had fought for decades for politics, is suddenly and completely strange on the same page.
Around the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it is obvious to me that this also involves considerable risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the provocative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
"" "when we talk about" "" "normalization" "" "and" "" "Trump" "", "we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his kittens will no longer be thrown away." ""
There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republican normalizes the right wing, which suddenly appears as a term of reasonableness in comparison with its standards.
I find myself now infested by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both in comparison to Trump are indeed a very mild crime.
If Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republican only needs to be mentally healthy in order to qualify as immeasurable enhancement.
When my cousin was in the city, we brought our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest carousel in the New York Parks Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine.
The horses are enormous, fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are creaty and the animals twist in order to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the klimpering music conveys this in a curious way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines are too familiar to provide a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage - the Topic Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big roundabout in the north of London.
The Central Park Carousel is still a strange magic experience, as two two-year-old, 11-year-old and two women in the 40-twenties can go on it and have a great time.
If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked for it.
On the other hand, during this week I was forced to assess my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.
In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.
This not only leads to a slowdown of what should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need arises.
The poor woman in the department store was apologizing, while I was tired of experiencing my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius transferred to hospital with chest pain
Pistorius left the prison for the second time.
Last year, he was hospitalised for the treatment of carving in his wrists, according to the prison authorities, after a fall in his cell.
After an appeal of the prosecutors, Pistorius was sentenced to a first death-seat.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day in 2013, taking it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria on her.
Pistorius claimed he had his girlfriend for a nighttime intruder hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appeal, of which they say she is too lenient.
The National Prosecutor's Office said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year.
Pistorius risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
As farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberger schools, the four-tankers from Fiero and Epfenhofen have been discharged into the school holidays and in the secondary schools.
Three of the students go to secondary school in the future, four to the secondary school.
On Tuesday evening, school manager Angelika Sitte greeted the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen.
The 29 pupils of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle, who grew up in the chicken farm, but then released to freedom.
"" "the mlower band played a musical with the title" "" "The Eagle in the chicken farm" "". "" ""
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and caused it to breed from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken-kens a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making a chicken out of him smashed, the eagle started spreading his wings on a high mountain.
After that the classes showed three and four in the studio of Yvonne Frank a chicken dance.
The hens danced with the young gockles, the cylinders wore to make the bet.
The Eagle stands for integration, said school director Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different from the other kittens (chicks), but belongs to it.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His destiny is to be free.
She wished each quadruped, that he felt accepted in his new school.
There followed thanks to the colleagues, former schoolmaster Michael Müller, who repeatedly jumps into teaching passports, and the parents "representatives.
The kitchen time is over now, declared class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She only dismiss her students after two years of lessons, because it was a really great time.
Finally she was able to rely on the four-door-ässler.
At the end all students made a song of summer time and holiday time.
At the same time great joy broke out with the children.
Eight first-grade students have already registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camps in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted on television, shared.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of illegal detention people were arrested in Sithonia, among them the two Bulgarian people.
On the same day, they were released while an investigation is underway.
The State Department reported BTV that the Bulgarians were released later.
"" "" "" "the Greek authorities have exacerbated control of the free camping and put on everyone who is found to stay in a place that is not meant for this purpose, considerable fines." ""
Controls are continued throughout the season.
The Ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: what people need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers need to take part in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are supposed to improve the emission performance of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and some Euro 6.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the software updates managed are voluntary.
"" "" "" "the mandatory updates previously only apply to vehicles that have cheating software," "" "says Anja Smetanin." ""
The post-retrofitting has ordered the Federal Aviation Office (KBA).
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months, but not yet called an exact date.
Daimler advised to appeal to every person affected.
If an inspection is due anyway, this will be done within the scope of the inspection.
How long are the changes to be drawn up altogether?
"" "" "" "hard to say," "" "says Smetanin." ""
It depends on the manufacturer's commitment and political pressure.
"" "" "" "because we have seen, the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment up to now." "" "" ""
How long should the update last?
The retrofitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers do that do not drive a car of BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?
The ACE will advise you to wait.
Probably foreign manufacturers would reproduce, so Smetanin.
Does a massive price decline of Euro-4 cars now threaten?
The ACE is afraid of that.
But in the regions where driving licences threaten.
In rural areas, there has so far been no loss of value for older diesels.
The ACE will advise you to wait for sale.
Ll Cool J Receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Award Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners does not want to come - from protest.
Ll Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95) belong to the scholars.
The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, U.S. President Donald Trump will hold a reception and together with his wife Melania will attend the award ceremony.
The prize-winner Lear, who has become known with progressive TV series, has already announced that he would refrain from participating in the gala.
"" "the" "" "New York Times" "" "he said:" "" "this presidency has decided to neglect the arts and human rights - even the means - and that burdens me." "" "" ""
The 59-year-old Estefan emphasized that she will use Trump to clarify her point of view.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
The former prize winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, is going to retire next year.
The place is already written - but suitable candidates are rare.
For 31 years, Wacker has been a city master builder.
And the work is still a lot of fun to him, as he teaches in the press conference.
He reports of varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.
At the same time, it is surprising that no application has yet to fulfil the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the earliest possible date.
In this way - taking into account the regular periods of notice - there is still enough time for a familiarization.
Since Haslach is acting as a sub-law office for the Administrative Community, the applicant must present corresponding agreements.
Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.
If they were unable to fill them any more, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But the proximity to the city is important to the city and to it itself, says Wacker, who reports from a good working atmosphere as well as a good mood between the authorities and citizens.
Over 30 years in office, a number of significant projects have gathered to look back at the Wacker with pride.
"" "" "" "we make the city worth living," "" "he is sure about the construction department and its staff." ""
But also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla-Areals and the Niederhofen Park are about to be initiated.
The Kinzig Bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, and the stadium refurbishment is still a topic.
"" "the latter only will strike some 1.5 million euros," "" "if we do it right," "" "says Wacker." ""
"all in all great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun. "
In terms of design, there is considerable leeway for a city master builder.
Haslachs's own yard and gardener can react to many things flexibly.
"" "" "" "you can move a lot," "" "says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors." ""
As the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in," when new buildings are approved, the outgoing urban builder emphasises.
Anyway, the architect has a high level of responsibility.
"" "he is the client," "" "in the end everything runs over my table." "" "" ""
With care and coordination, he can count on many years of staff: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been there for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) has been there for 15 years.
Also that his successor remains for a long time, Wacker wants: "we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place."
Continuity is not only important for a good working climate but also for the further design of the city.
If you want to be able to inherit Roland Wacker, you should be able to instruct the city of Haslach as a graduate engineer or a bachelor's degree in architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and construction planning.
The municipal construction department is subject to high and civil engineering, construction planning, undermining opportunities, administration of urban properties, urban depot with building yard and urban gardeners as well as the Lower Building Law Department, including monuments conservation.
Bicycles tossed on leads: closed on the south track
According to the police, the previously unknown culprits had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track crossing in the area of the Leobener Straße (B116) onto the leaderships.
These were so severely damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators go out of two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night.
Close to the scene there were witnessed by a shooter and a bicycle driver by witnesses.
"" "" "" "this goes far beyond a Lausannois," "" "said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to APA." ""
"" "" "" "the perpetrator would have brought himself into great danger and jeopardized traction." ""
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, as well as the delay in delay and the costs for rail-moving traffic, there may also be a number of sponsors of the railway customers to the perpetrators.
"" "overall, a" "" "substantial" "" "sum was to be assumed, the speaker said." ""
The damages had been repaired on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the south-rail track could be guided without obstructions.
Nearly ten people had fallen off on Friday morning, two of them entered the correspondence.
Freight trains did not fall out, but they were delayed.
According to ÖBB-spokesman Christoph Posch, some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study says exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.
The incurable condition affecting around 1.3 million in the US and in the UK 300,000 causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The leading researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrolling in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes, which hide in the food, do not penetrate the body.
Cells that are able to cause inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease.
In experiments it was found that a type of tolerance promoting immune cells occurs in mice carrying a specific bacterium in their bowels.
And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an on tryptophan diet tolerant diet tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus promotes, if the same system also applies to humans.
The postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan researched a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which, however, had not had this.
It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiome of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and six bacterial species were found that were present in mice with the immune cells, but were missing in mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were created by the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers sent L. reuteri into a liquid and then passed small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on immature immune cells isolated from mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was cleaned from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, which is known as an Indol-3 lactic acid.
If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's feed, the number of cells increased by approximately 50 percent, but if the tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
"" "she said:" "" "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine." ""
"" "potentially high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population." "" "" ""
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has committed a "genius" to Nemanja Matic
"" "with Nemanja Matic, Manchester United signed a" "" "genius" "", "Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder on Wednesday evening had his debut against Sampdoria." ""
The 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2: 1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup kicked off against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed the holder roll as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched at will.
However, matic was excluded from the pre-delivery Asia tour of the blues and only managed 45 minutes to improve Mourinho, that he had to improve before the opening of the Premier League season.
"he needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"" "" "" "we will help him to be ready sooner than later." "" "" ""
Alongside Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho formed his start-XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed that Mourinho wanted another three new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" to meet three of his four primary new obligations.

Boeing "paints" Dreamliner in the sky
The aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew away from Seattle in the US state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in US state Michigan and moved into the form of a Dreamliner via the USA, which are several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
The form of a Dreamliner was to be on the radar screens.
The whole thing was a endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had already made such advertisement earlier.

New setback for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader, S & D prime ministers always looked for Berlin with a certain concern before elections.
Only a fire from the central party, but no headwind from the Confederation, was the most important wish of the election fighters.
Since Martin Schulz leads the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the staff members from Willy-Brandt-Haus have been observing the events in the provincial capitals of the SPD (SPD).
What Schulz has gotten from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach by headwinds.
There were deep setbacks.
One after another.
The federal CDU looks after the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony as a general signal against the coalition of the SPD and the Greens.
"" "" "" "this shows once again: red-green can simply not rule out reliably," "" "said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber, the editorial network Germany (RND)." ""
The surprise fraction of a Green Party deputies has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the election of the Landtag, its red-green coalition lost its one-voice majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The Green Federal Executive Director Michael Kellner has called on the backsliding Lower Saxony Green Party member Elke Tests to return their mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear forgery of the electorate.
"" "Elke Tests must immediately return her mandate," "" "said the Federal Executive Director and Leader of the Green Party (RND)." ""
"" "" "" "that must not be true," "" "an SPD election campaigner sigh, when Friday morning the new job message reaches the party headquarters." ""
Stephan Weil, SPD-Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is facing the CDU without its own government majority following the resignation of the green deputies Elke Tests.
It is the provisional climax of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD state associations.
And nobody knows what comes next.
The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, not more, the comrades were reassuring at that time.
After the legislative elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
Then it became - and indeed everything became much worse.
The defeat in Kiel put the SPD in exchange, the Düsseldorf-Pleite was slipping the party smoothly.
In the weeks after, comrades, the comrades were again laboriously raging.
Then, when they had just had new courage, the G-20 summit from Hamburg came.
And with him came the next deep-blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD member of the SPD, lost his nimbus that weekend, because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned.
And because in crisis communication he did everything wrong with what you can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now also Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW Exhaust and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Lower Saxony's Prime Minister has long been criticised.
Slight changes in demand were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil has always tried to establish accents in the Confederation over the past few weeks.
The ambitions of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin also did not remain hidden in the context of Martin Schulz.
They let him grant, because they promised a stabilization of the party by Weil.
Now the exact opposite could occur.
"" "" "" "in this respect, Weil does not blame the party internal constraint of the Lower Saxon Greens." ""
And Schulz is not at all.
For the time being, comrades, therefore, try to keep their own ranks closed.
Their anger is directed towards the Greens, and especially to the backsliding Parliamentarian TWest.
"" "" "" "it is intolerable and democratic how Mrs. Tvest puts her own career income on the interests of all the others," "" "says Matthias Miersch, head of the SPD Parliamentary Left in the SPD Parliamentary Group, the editorial network Germany (RND)." ""
"" "" "" "Frau Twesten couldn't be elected as a direct candidate because of their person, but by the Land List of the Lower Saxony Green Party," "" "the Lower Saxon deputies continued." ""
The logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.
"" "Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD Parliamentary Group, complains of an" "" "undemocratic maneuver." "" "" ""
"" "" "" "the voters over four years ago was clear: people have made Stephan Weil a prime minister," "" "says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the leading candidate in the election of the Bundestag, the RND." ""
"" "" "" "now the personal career of a future CDU member falsifies the election result," "" "said Oppermann." ""
He called for the background to be clarified.
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments to the CDU of Lower Saxony.
Funding money for town core III
Those who want to rehabilitate their own house in the years can get support from the country soon.
In addition, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of the jetty of town development announced on Wednesday in a sensation.
At the beginning of the information session, Schindler once again gave a look back on what happened so far.
Since 1991, there have been some sanitation areas.
At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land Baden-Württemberg had taken over two-thirds of the funding amount.
In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.
"" "for Schindler, previous refurbishments are a" "" "successful project" "" "- it is finally important to encourage the development of the interior and not only to open up new construction areas." ""
On April 4, the Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III.
The funding amount amounts to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros would come from the country, the rest of the community's feelings.
How does a redevelopment area arise?
"" "one would, as Schindler further, investigate, where the" "" "really old" "" "houses are." ""
But it also plays a role as to whether in the planned area there is any interest in sanitising.
If necessary, the territorial borders may also shift again.
The bridge was on Wednesday evening Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.
"" "Keller presented the contents of the federal program" "" "Social City" "", "where the renovations would then be carried out." ""
The core of the program is the revitalisation of inner cities, improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure.
The measures would be objective-related, i.e. per plot.
The restructuring area would then finally be set as a statute.
The grants period for the subsidies has been running since January 1, 2017 until April 30, 2026.
Until September this year, however, the stocktaking will only take place once, in the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area receive a questionnaire to fill out the questionnaire.
In November or December, it should take place as soon as possible, so that the renovation can begin next year.
After that, Pietzschmann explained that each commune had to carry out the said preventive examinations.
The aim is to evaluate and decide when it will be sanitised and to what extent.
For the respective property there will be also a memorandum of repayment in the land register.
"" "" "" "Pietzschmann will come to himself once more, and make a picture of the situation," "" "she promised." ""
Gotzel emphasised that the project was a key success factor for the project.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out by the end of the summer holidays.
"" "the yellow questionnaire is the" "" "Building and Property sheet" "", "in which there is, among other things, the structural condition and the refurbishment views." ""
"" "in the grey questionnaire, the" "" "House- and Housing Rainbow" "", "data on size, distribution and residents of a residential area can be made." ""
"" "the blue" "" "Worksheet" "" "can only be filled if business premises are operated in the building." ""
However, it is important to note that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible for funding.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of funds according to the "greyhound principle" - whoever comes first, first advises.
"" "you cannot" "" "reserve" "" "subsidies for later." ""
"" "finally, photos of the project" "" "Location II" "" "were shown to make the audience a" "" "tasty" "" "renovation." ""
British inventor sets itself a microchip to come with a hand movement in house and car
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip, so that he can open his doorstep, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between the thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has partnered with Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisory anaesthesia in the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dogs implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the locks of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip, everything for a surcharge of £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and in his BMW Z4 technology which begins when his hand is at the wheel.
The advertising costs of the White House cost taxpayers thousands
The White House decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing in the last month costs taxpayers according to the military provided to the TIME magazine, up to 24,000 US dollars.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states.
In addition to a yacht made of Maine, a fireman made of Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi, the helicopter produced in Connecticut was exhibited.
The military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or cargo, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of it, because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event, the deputy commander of the Naval Aviation Committee.
The news showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o'clock in the morning at 7 o'clock in the morning at the South Lawn for the event, and so long stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, a second crew is required for the return flight due to restricting service hours.
The original flight crew was during the event with the helicopter while the security personnel of the unit remained on the plane during the time on the plane.
From the recordings provided by the TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act forbids federal employees to use state property for political purposes.
Records show that HMX-1 has asked if the event could violate destiny.
"" "" "" "a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed that this was not the case," "" "the commandant wrote." ""
"" "" "" "sounds as if you're locked," "" "said the deputy commander." ""
"" "the event" "" "Made in America" "" "was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act." ""
But also official events have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave an impetus to reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.
But to claim their use only for a photo op is unusual.
Trump performed an investigation in February when the presidential plane was in front of the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of messages complaining about the use of the presidential aeroplane by its predecessor.
"" "" "" "the White House is enthusiastic about the show" "" "Made In America" "" "- the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials," "" "said the deputy secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters." ""
HMX-1 crew often carry training flights in the area around Washington and the South Lawn to depose US President in the White House with precise centimetres.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training courses in the White House.
"" "the flight for the" "" "Made in America" "" "event counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said a civil servant." ""
Helicopters also flew 11 hours this day for "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said that taxpayers took over the burden of none of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in exporting the helicopter to the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget labels for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
According to the hourly rate of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per flight.
Records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate.
"" "" "" "the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for refund rates is highly misleading," "" "Walters said." ""
"" "" "" "these estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual funding." "" "" ""
According to a 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and conclusion of the contract.
At that time, the former spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the helicopter for the event.
"the idea is to present things that are produced in America this week," Spicer said.
"" "" "" "and I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security and I expect hundreds if not thousands of people depend on it." ""
And I think like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
Of course it is appropriate to emphasize that. "
It was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat down in the driver's seat of a fire engine.
In the White House Trump said to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss in front of tricky job
Runner-up of the Second Tennis Bundesliga kicks off at the Tabular-third Suchsdorf SV.
The TC blue-white Neuss performs tomorrow at 11 o'clock in Kiel at the table third Suchsdorf SV.
Despite five batches of still flawless balance, the leader of the Second Tennis League has gained the sense of reality.
Team Principal Marius Zay in any case has respect for the opponent.
"" "" "" "this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation." ""
Especially at the rear positions I find the team very good. "
For class and stability at the Suchsdorf SV, imports from the high North are mainly concerned.
"their Danes and Finns can even point to deployments in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in doubles, "says Zay, looking at Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören und Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerska (all Denmark).
"" "" "" "this will be hard for us as always." ""
"" "you also need a good dose of luck." "" "" ""
The Neusser crew for the trip to the high north is convenient.
Maxime Janvier could give his debut for blue-white.
If the Frenchman, currently active in the Challenger tournament in the Italian biella active Frenchman, does not succeed in the Bundesliga, the Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) playing at the tournament in the Czech Liberec will be his first deployment in this season.
The previously undefeated Chiene Hans Podlesnik-Castillo was yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski still at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel at the ball.
But he should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster, also Máté Valkusz could re-enter the team.
If it is enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was the number one of the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the trainer at Marius Zay fills the cadre.
How America can harm OMV
Donald Trump was not really happy when he put his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to tighten sanctions against Russia.

Since then, investors of the local OMV, who co-financed the construction of the Russian Eastern Province North Stream 2 together with other European companies.

Roll back: the city introduces 46 kitchen aids
The city organises the Kita lunch table itself.
With firm contact persons for the children and a delegation to the team.
In the city's day care centers, the clock is turned back.
On September 1st the city of Krefeld takes over food supply in the city's daycare centres (Kitas) again in self-control.
"" "for Sonja Pommeranz, deputy head of the youth welfare department, this is a good news:" "" "we were all very pleased." "" "" ""
Cooking is still out of the house: a caterer takes over this task and delivers fresh water cooled.
The city operates in the Krefeld area 46 daycare centers, in 44 children get a hot meal at lunchtime.
In the past kiting year 2,800 children sat at the tables, and the demand is growing steadily.
"" "" "" "in the meantime, not only children who are cared for 45 days of the week are eating in the" "" "Kita" "", "explained Pomeranz." ""
"" "" "" "the offer also applies in the 35-hour supervision, if children stay until 14 o'clock." "" "" ""
46 partial-time employees have kitchen service from 1 September: they heat the meals supplied, supplement them with salad, raw food and fruit, portions the meal individually, give away the meal, clean out, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"" "" "" "the employees are assigned to a ita," "" "says Pomeranz." ""
The size - there are two grouped as well as seven-group equipment - determines the hourly circumference.
"the kitchen staff are now part of the Kita team," says Pommeranz.
"" "" "" "so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement pedagogical concepts." "" "" ""
Because it is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons.
"" "" "" "the children should help prepare the food." "" "" ""
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is reasonable.
Also for the children.

This continuity is important for children.
Cleaning the Kita-premises - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out by special cleaning staff in the future.
This variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has, in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen power, also the charm that it has challenged in the cost comparison between self-control and foreign distribution for the city as the most economical one, it reads from the press office.
And that, although 46 partial-time forces are newly hired.

GMB apprehension on investments at McVidars factory in Glasgow
A union wants to ensure the long-term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow at managers of Biskuit manufacturer McViast.
GMB Scotland said that the company kept silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross location.
More than 500 employees work in the factory, which, in addition to other products, produces hobnobs and pure tea cookies.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than £5 million in recent years.
"" "he added that employees and union representatives would" "" "experience first" "" "if their activities would change." ""
In a letter to the head of the company, GMB Scotland McVitie's urged to "express concerns that financing for modernization of production lines will not be pushed forward."
GMB-Senior-Organizer Drew Duffy said: "the fact that we can't gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross affects our members deeply.
Generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrate heavily on the local community and the Glasgow, an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantaged.
Thus, under the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the background of the Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline, the Eastern end of Glasgow is in urgent need of a thriving production presence at McViast. "
"" "a spokeswoman of Pladis said:" "" "the branch manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond right to it as we value the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives." ""
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive.
"" "she added:" "" "in recent years we have invested more than £5 million in our Tollcross site, especially in production lines and operational improvements." ""
We recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a production facility. if our operations change at the location, employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this. "
Did the PSG Barcelona warned of Neymar three years ago?
The page of La Liga may show its interest to Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain won't leave Neymar after she has given an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but did she warn Barcelona three years before the world record attack?
The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record more than twice the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United in the last season for $89 million.
After finishing, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.
Barcelona is mad about the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source near the Catalans board insists that the club has always done his best to take care of him since his arrival in Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago from the PSG president?
When Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for every club who wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.
"" "" "" "I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," "" "said Al-Khelaifi." ""
"we respect all clubs.
"" "but if they try to sign one of our players with them, this will have consequences." "" "" ""
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, where the Spanish association expressed interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price deals for Neymar.
Scooter reversed and damaged
In the night of Friday on Saturday, an unknown perpetrator had intentionally upset one in the Königsfeld street in front of the property number 30 and so on the disguise of the vehicle material damage of more than 200 euros.
The police station Schramberg, telephone 07422 / 27 01-0, asks for instructions.
The police witnesses are looking for witnesses to an accident at the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
The driver of a VW Touran had to evade a car and toured the crash barrier.
On Thursday evening the 34-year old from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW came from Stolzenau on the B 215 from Stolzenau in the direction of Leese.
In the area of the bypass of Stolzenau, a passenger car came to meet him in his driving lane, so that he had to move to the right.
The Touran-driver toured the crash barriers.
Damage to the car was caused by material damage.
The driver of the coming passenger car, a Mercedes Benz, had overhauled a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident.
According to the accident damaged, it may well be good that the cyclist had not noticed the accident at all.
The police now ask witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the prisoner's vehicle to contact the Commissariat in Stolzenau on tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburger Domspatzen-report on the misuse cases relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.
This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann says.
The final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussion.
Christian Weissler, speaker of the reform movement "Wir sind Kirche," declared after publication in relation to the German press agency, he expected from the former Regensburg Bishop and current Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.
It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then incorrect evaluation of the processes.
"" "the Vatican newspaper" Osservatore Romano "" "" on the other hand criticized that in reporting about violence in the domes of domes with "" "" double standards "" "." "" "
In regard to the assaults in Regensburg no one doubted that it would be "shameful and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; but the author Lucetta Scaraffia, Historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee.
"" "" "" "the habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scaraffia." ""
"" "Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "" "one would like to go to the church and it's a devoured fresher." "" "" ""
"" "she also pointed out that in her youth" "" "blows were a normal pedagogical means" "" "to be done with cheeky children, as I was one." "" "" ""
It would be unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on the misuse cases, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann writes, who wrote with Ratzinger the "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).
"" "" "" "I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he assesses the results of the final report." ""
What exactly is in the 440-page report submitted by the Bishum Regensburg to the Enlightenment Attorney Ulrich Weber?
A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were subjected to sexual abuse between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s with high plausibility.
In the final report Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, says: "in summary, it can be said that many cases of physical and psychological violence have been used by Domkapellmeister.
Especially in the case of high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more intense.
Nevertheless, contrary to numerous other allegations, many victims have appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even bring positive memories to him despite violence. "
In the interview, Heshemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger seems to be relieved.
Mr. Heshemann, the 440-page report on the "Incidents of the Exercise of Protection of Violence at the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a conflicting picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
"" "for one, many students emphasise his" "" "humanity" "". "" ""
On the other hand, it appears as choleriker and perfectionist, which became handy when a Domspatz brought no top performance musically.
How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?
Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long story from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is common in it.
He is particularly devoted to eight pages and he is clearly spoken of every suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of violence at the pre-school also took place outside its sphere of influence.
At best it is possible to reproach him, to experience it too late or to have taken first hints seriously enough.
"" "the" "" "Domspatzengymnasium" "", "on which he worked, was felt by virtually all the respondents as - literally -" "" "redemption," "" "" heaven "" "" and "" "" better world "" "." "" "
The vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also provides an excellent certificate, described him as "warm-hearted," "skilled" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy, and "always surrounded by grapes of children."
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to rage eruptions.
The fact that he did not only snooze with chairs and threw the mudlock on the floor, but he also distributed earthen ears and too cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
"" "" "" "to his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widely used in the questionable period, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents and teachers." ""
Do you know such methods of breeding?
Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.
I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state school.
Compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the violent excesses of violence at the preschool, they are of course bagatellen.
One wonders whether it is not to do with his familiarity and role as the brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just rushed to him.
Many people who have never understood him are still working diligently on the Bavarian Pope.
But the truth is: the report ratifies Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
In the media, a lot has been reported in connection with the report on the subject of abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen.
Is Georg Ratzinger also involved in any involvement or involvement with regard to sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: clearly no.
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claimed to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapellmeister.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
"" "" "" "I never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "" "said one of the afflicted," "" "It was all very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""
The real problem in educating sexual abuse was, however, that most victims remain silent.
If they did not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir director, who would have been a colleague of the culprits in a professional manner.
How do the Domspatzen pupil rate Ratzinger's role with regard to the misuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it like this: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely evidence and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I consider it... even to be really absurd to assume that it was to him... Bubs more intrusive or clearer or more opened than towards their parents, interns, trusts of trust, etc.
That one talks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "
"" "thus the report concludes with a clear result:" "" "that the students and / or their surroundings affected him in advance could not be confirmed as part of the investigation." "" "" ""
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is free to speak of any co-existence.
He cannot be accused of preventing or displaying him.
Therefore there is no reason to associate a good name with these refutable crimes, as happened in some cases.
"" "there was a lot of" "" "violent excesses" "" "in the media to read in the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""
"" "the former Domkapellmeister, Georg Ratzinger, is accused of" "" "looking away" "" "in the report." ""
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything was mixed up in the reporting and mixed into a huge orange melange of sexual abuse and violent excesses and somewhere, right in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.
But this is in turn a misuse of the report.
Because it is separated cleanly: between the pre-school and the high-school of the domes, between sexual abuse and violent excesses and, let's say, other allegations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, so also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the chorus of the Cathedral Sparrows.
The whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were literally harassled and maltreated, and suffered from them, all happened at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to prevail.
But with those whom Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only to face when they were already at the cathedral-cat-school-nasium.
"" "on this, like most of the witnesses, the theme of" "" "primary school" "" "was taboo." ""
"" "one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even" "" "paradisiacal" "" "conditions." ""
What else was different at the cathedral-cat-school?
Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic power.
"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims appreciate the general humanity of R." "" "and therefore in numerous cases even unite positive memories with him in numerous cases." "" "" ""
At most, the reproach still remains to have looked away.
But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the preschool.
The first time in 1970 / 71 when he just started to establish himself and from the events at a school in which he did not work and was responsible, (thus the witness) wanted to hear nothing, and then again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently shut the ears in front of the states?
Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the high school gymnasium, which the report was even reproduced.
"" "in this he points out," "" "that in the preparatory school there will continue to be the punishment." "" "" ""
In the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed when Prüfer's penalties were banned in Bavaria too.
Before that they took place in a legal grey-zone, as each of us knows well.
It was difficult for him to estimate, where the sufferers might be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded.
But you can't say that he has always looked away.
This is simply not true.
It was only in 1980 that the capital punishment of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis insists that it is unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time at that time.
How do you see it?
"" "Michael hesemann:" "" "historians are talking about the" "" "snare of anachronism" "", "i.e. the risk of assessing the past according to today's moral standards." ""
The princess is right.
But this of course does not apply to sexual abuse, which has been abhorrent at all times, and not for what has been banned in the preschool of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond that at that time.
This is all very horrible and I am glad that it will finally work.
But at the same time I have to take protection from Georg Ratzinger because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, that is to say earrings and ears and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When corporal punishment was then banned, he kept strictly adhering to it.
"" "which picture of his Regensburg time did Georg Ratzinger play in talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""
Did the subject of the trial judge also speak in the language?
Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI tells from his perspective that the Cathedral Sparrows played only a minor role.
Nevertheless, I do not at all show that he led a strict regiment there.
But even this must be said once: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang from the hitherto nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, the true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and candy alone, one does not make a big singer out of unruly boys and every success, whatever the area, but always discipline, passion and overcoming.
What kind of people have you experienced as Georg Ratzinger at the conversations with her book?
Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I have met Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful, humorous, grounded, deep-believing and heartily-hearted people, of whom you can't imagine that he could only do something for a fly.
I regularly get contact with him, like many former Domspatzen today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly visit him, read it, read it - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.
Those who did not forgive him until today that he was strictly speaking to them are clearly in the minority.
Most of the domes are thankful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music.
And that he is always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, of course, that may be - but also a lovely respectable person, to which they still look up today and which they almost revere.
And please, again clearly: everything you accuse to him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time.
We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.
But it is highly unfair to make a man just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make a media scapegoat.
The evil intent that is behind it is all too obvious.
For the report, which was just published, relieves him.
Now he would command a 93-year-old man who acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany would probably know no one of the Regensburger Domspatzen.
