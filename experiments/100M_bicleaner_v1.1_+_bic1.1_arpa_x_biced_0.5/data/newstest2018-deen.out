Munich , 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
an asylum institution , where young people are supposed to meet .
a pit chapel , where it is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
farmers cultivate the former cause of farmers .
the oldest official card coin boo@@ sts exciting stories .
it is annoying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everyone who had to get upset because the Nav@@ i was showing a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historic maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavarian State Government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but precisely therefore very enligh@@ tening .
especially when comparing them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how towns and communities have changed in the area of circulation of Munich &apos;s Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that is not immediately recognizable as such .
for towns and municipalities , detailed maps , so @-@ called elem@@ ental sheets , have been incorporated into the large overview map .
these were created according to the Bavarian Association of Sur@@ veying between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic record of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops finally with@@ drew with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on 9 February 18@@ 01 : it was the present @-@ day neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern card .
Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph continued the project , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau , &quot; and thus the Bavarian sur@@ veying management .
the information leaf@@ let for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is to be found on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek ( Bavarian State Library ) .
the comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. in 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling lies in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where the West@@ park is today , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand @-@ written numbered flute pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ sus &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
small par@@ c@@ els show no farmers there today - but gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 the scene of the October test , was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert .
on the other hand of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or from the hill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On the air &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich district Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the establishment - that psychiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended with the chains of so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Irish &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also prohibited the personnel from using violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
there was room for 280 patients , later it was extended to 500 seats .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ se@@ power plant in Haar in 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ikum in Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been located there since 2006 .
young people in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um meet in the area of the former Au@@ er Bad@@ an .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with educational establishments .
West is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the Children &apos;s House &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was erected - architec@@ turally based on the original construction of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bombing ra@@ ids .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger Street was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the Al@@ lied bombs broke many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a big one remained until today - at Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a chapel chapel dating back to the Middle Ages , once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days the prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn commu@@ ter route takes place .
with the slider , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil rights group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the promotion of coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discri@@ min@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for Af@@ ro @-@ American travellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention when travelling through the state , as a number of du@@ bi@@ ous , racial @-@ based incidents occur throughout the state and are noted here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Group &apos;s opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recent law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes people more difficult to acc@@ use discrimination , as well as the prosec@@ uting authorities of the state , which are dispro@@ portion@@ ately aimed at minorities , prompted the group to issue travel warnings , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the president of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist crimes against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in di@@ gni@@ fied circumstances at the beginning of the year , after having no fuel at all during the voyage and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council also points to a recent report by Mis@@ sour@@ i At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s Office showing that black mot@@ orists in the state will be 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be willing to bring in deposit money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI report program , which classi@@ fies the state with regard to the number of injuries to the 16th rank of the country .
the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law which would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company because of housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the States adopted immigration laws that bind local law enforcement agencies to arrest people because of immigration violations , which will contribute to further race profile in view of AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently , interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
fence project is elementary
the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ de@@ watering project is a successful project and will continue next year .
the CD@@ U members of Parliament Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac gave a picture on the spot .
in the right @-@ hand courtyard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the fishing company CD@@ U met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first provided insights into his farm , where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 milk cows and as many young kit@@ tens and accommod@@ ates in five apartments holiday @-@ branches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black @-@ white milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative marketing path for him for the milk of his cows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwen@@ de@@ mann &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este comes exclusively regional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he is also chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he described the electric fence as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot profit@@ ably manage on such steep surfaces .
the green area care for a lot of work , much needs to be done with the br@@ ush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the parent company and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer , even though he did not conduct bio @-@ operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Leader &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported .
it is hoped that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the land could be extended for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have are those people who work in agriculture and think about how they can continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mayor emphas@@ ised . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often critic@@ ised for funding
a total of 25 plots were f@@ enced in 2013 by eleven participants .
the open @-@ up area thus amounts to 40 hectares , which may not be for@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 .
from the total cost of 71 500 euros , half was promoted over leaders , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisch@@ bach .
thus the farmer stayed 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 km of pasture @-@ fence .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and rural women . &quot;
Peter Weiss was also convinced : &quot; here , the best foods are produced . &quot;
the Land@@ scape Conservation Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state @-@ run promotion of pasture @-@ f@@ ences .
the aim is the disclosure of the Black Forest .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
in addition , the area to be f@@ enced must not be smu@@ gg@@ able ( inclin@@ ation above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by aff@@ or@@ estation .
the application of eight participants with 24 pitches , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence , is currently running for the Fis@@ her@@ bach Wei@@ dez@@ aun@@ cing Project 2018 .
the open @-@ up area is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 1@@ 12@@ ,000 euros .
is nothing sacred anymore ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ enze Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the President &apos;s suggestions for the dr@@ astic limitation of legal migration to the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty I@@ mit@@ ators would have liked him if he had done it .
but he attacked its meaning , and especially the significance attributed to it , when the famous poem of Emma Laz@@ arus in 1903 , 17 years after completion of the monument , was added to its base .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compla@@ ined : &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem you refer to is added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is fac@@ tu@@ ally correct , but as he put it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary resonance of Laz@@ arus &apos;s stirring words , the only ones in which a state not only invites the old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ eds , your poor , and your afflicted masses longing to breathe freely , and the miserable waste of your rich shores . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; miserable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better seen on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in the USA .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict about the significance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and their friends who used to place their words on the basis of their death at the base - knew well that they performed a high political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ ism by presenting the feminine em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn classic image .
Laz@@ arus has changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of Ex@@ il@@ antes .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , people from right wing wanted to change it for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued that the Statue of Liberty won &apos;t invite anyone , but rather an early Neo@@ conserv@@ atives who bring the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here .
the meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of view of perception .
Laz@@ arus &apos;s great imagin@@ ative action was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted , miserable , but desperate people after long and often horrible journeys on the deck of ships .
it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
and this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to acknowledge .
their torch should not light the way , but light the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the United Kingdom Team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance director of the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ piece Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship ader &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special develops in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the UK must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type in the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ flip - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected team captain by the team .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the genuine feeling of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver medal winner , who will compete at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les at its fifth world championships , says it &apos;s &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the UK team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes in the world championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mid @-@ distance runner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mu@@ ir carries on this road and last year set up five British and two European records . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman to watch for a great season , which included victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle recalls her first world championships , when the only other Scot@@ sman was in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
the team captain says that they are &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots belong not only to the team , but in some cases they will also be involved in med@@ als and fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team@@ mates had voted for me and chosen me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I &apos;m very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well established athletes , athletes who want to climb on po@@ di@@ ums .
what is my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think it went well .
I have only indicated that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from being back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block Cri@@ tics via Facebook : do not concern yourself with a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters .
the father of our country knew something of bad news .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers hit him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he kno@@ cked at the criticism , sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Mary@@ land , Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him of it at the beginning of this week .
the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as a fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a Republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary type of heat .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to de@@ but@@ t his hair @-@ less head to chemotherapy on his side .
hence the blocking of individuals who come to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side is a public forum that is considered officially and by employees paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan spokesperson A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the Gover@@ nor &apos;s actions and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the post said with some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , no troll@@ s .
they all said their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not profound .
the pastor rec@@ ited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented cour@@ te@@ ously that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the news release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also do not appreciate this idea , if a number of people take a position on the same subject , they are rather dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the staff of the Gover@@ nor described as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much cleaner than in former times when people have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles or to arrest demonstr@@ ators and silence them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mile@@ stones in this issue was Virginia &apos;s last week .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she banned a vot@@ er from her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also visited AC@@ L@@ U for his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable port had a similar effect as the internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous scri@@ bes suggested to his leadership .
and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ cio &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions that critic@@ ised his position on the Am@@ ity treaty , trade and shipping with Britain over@@ came his office , according to historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not silence them .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comforts in the Renaissance Club
the former European No 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope to enjoy home comforts during the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an holds the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year led to the final round in Arch@@ er@@ field , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the association founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition .
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he fixed that place .
he is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 year career .

coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos; a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;

fewer lung cancers by passive smoking
in the past two decades fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists at the University Medical Center Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer deaths can be attributed to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this issue of 1994 .
at that time there were 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking a year in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new study is published in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; the construction work in the Vill@@ ette street is in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are reasonably in time &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is a lot of se@@ amounts in the underground , which is not noted in the plans .
traffic that continually obstruc@@ ts construction work represents a major problem for the company &apos;s building company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the driver &apos;s ignorance of red lights and barriers is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road was closed and only the scheduled buses were allowed to go through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ est@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p company have been working on the bridge for weeks .

poverty and Death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in their wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually calls a sweet potato - locally called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - directly in the chim@@ ney . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after half an hour the char@@ red tu@@ ber is taken with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed up .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , such as washing clothes with mur@@ ky water from nearby mar@@ sh .
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were not assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course it can be too dangerous to work late : most of the villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many are drinking hard , and there are soldiers here .
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony that was shot in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occupation forces .
an existing movement that stir@@ red up the independence of the Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal monitors .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua with the independent part of Papua New Guinea that included the eastern part of the island .
the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the rental car .
there is no public transport .
the city , with some 19@@ ,000 inhabitants , is made up of wooden houses , surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and from corru@@ gated iron roofs , which have been transformed by rust into various yel@@ low@@ ish @-@ brown tones .
very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans made their trip here , let alone journalists and practically no for@@ eigner .
before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans honoured a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skirt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua Indonesia is the poor@@ est province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst children &apos;s mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass Hill , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has mined gold and copper worth 3.1 billion US dollars .
in addition , Papua has assets valued at $ 78 billion .
however , these riches are a source of misery for the Papua which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military maintains a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid almost 20 million US dollars from local military units and units , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ uan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists more than 500@@ ,000 Jews have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army since 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as tribe in the 1970 &quot; s became genocide in accordance with the Asia Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Will Use All &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is reported in a report by the Bris@@ ban@@ e Arch@@ dioc@@ ese from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as incidents happen every week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the screws have increased since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but the demographic development is changing because Muslim economic migrants are coming from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ping can@@ te@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the migrants began to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai natives who moved to work in the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the native of Papua - the mo@@ m mo@@ m &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - cost their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ o , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Papua during his campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter claimed 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua , little has changed , and today the locals feel che@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts have been broken because we agreed in 2014 for Jok@@ ho@@ i , with the expectation that it will fill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after the inaugur@@ ation of Jok@@ o &apos;s inaugur@@ ation in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas songs before a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should switch on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took offen@@ se on their tone and later returned to four soldiers , according to the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their rif@@ le pist@@ ons , said sacrifices and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so severely beaten to fall into coma .
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting bu@@ cks and performed the Wa@@ ita dance - continuously and im@@ it@@ ating a birds singing - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started throwing stones on the police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent an order via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says TI@@ ME in an official document that was not released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and urged the crowd to return home .
nobody was in the mood to listen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , suddenly I was shot in my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the bul@@ let came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he added .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , his c@@ ousin , who was a witness to the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and tried his body to make sure he was it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ ane , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot;
the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua @-@ police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers only wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because it was attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people are threatening to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokesperson of the Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news of the kill@@ ings took place only the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historic ab@@ uses in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Minister of security , Wir@@ anto , said in October 2016 that he would establish an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the consideration of historical human rights ab@@ uses .
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and at the beginning of the 2000 @-@ ies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , which the UN charged with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which called for more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence referendum in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua were already included , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with gri@@ m dis@@ belief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus reiter@@ ated the view that the people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was struck by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the dead bodies , the military sought me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police fired on villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on his way to the hospital .
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested before the company &apos;s sit@@ ing office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warnings .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ gade ( Indonesian param@@ ili@@ tary police ) began shooting at the crowd and killing one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were so panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were delivered quickly here , the TI@@ ME . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called upon to hold the officers involved and withdraw the mobile bri@@ gade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a herd of rest for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tribe of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the &quot; Free State Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of Papua , attacking spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ die Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai during the last years and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; among the people of Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a tragic forgotten place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty is strengthening the dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is equally out of reach .
people here are building everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can work on four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
over the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native countries of Papua and the new migrants have grown , which since the opening of new flight routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire arrived in a larger number .
the few jobs in the region usually go to the better educated and more prosper@@ ous migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua people rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to compete with their own businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money here , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai family council .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua .
furthermore , restrictions on the reporting of international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they were given the rare permission to film .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia @-@ director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ o &apos;s electoral campaign have not been realised by the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers to foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ quiet eastern provinces of Papua and West pap@@ a : visa den@@ ying and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March six Pacific States - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; different and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua ( including Pan@@ i@@ ai &apos;s shooting ) .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokesman for Indonesian Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so that it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on 4 May , indigenous people broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source who participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua people say that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ho@@ i again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jok@@ ho@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants Jok@@ ho@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor education and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their vote for Jok@@ ho@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; debt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai shot @-@ sacrifice carried out a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of a victim was buried in an area exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps they will never come to justice , but at least they will not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capturing the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of Dubai &apos;s highest homes in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 3@@ 37 meter high , 79 @-@ story building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is sometimes called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with fire alarm and people scre@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; an inhabit@@ ant named George An@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Du@@ ba@@ is civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units fire the fire at 4.@@ 00 a.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) and cooled down the building .
the government said that they are working on providing accommodation to those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage caused by cl@@ adding , external cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation came .
in Britain the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding at the Gren@@ fell Tower in London could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has gone through with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City session , the only two @-@ thirds majority for this sport was to play a revolutionary proposition to play Davis Cup single sole on two winning sets .
these often very long , but also therefore highly este@@ emed five @-@ sentence classics remain the traditional competition thus .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of member countries voted for reform , the goal of IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only margin@@ alized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will continue to work on improving the application .
even before the vote , the proposal came after a lot of contradictions before the proposal to finish the final at a neutral place .
new starting in 2018 is only comparatively minor details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the next round in the following year .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements for training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and the players will have to complete less official media appointments in front of the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers brings forbidden items to the plane , finds a survey
a survey conducted among air passengers showed that more than 20 percent were deliberately smu@@ g@@ gled into the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent carrying the plane while accidentally carrying prohibited knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent said they were bel@@ at@@ edly discovered that they were mistakenly charged with fire@@ arms , am@@ mun@@ ition or explo@@ sives .
the survey of more than 1,000 persons , conducted by a Jet Charter Service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers would rather dis@@ regard the rules .
the respon@@ dents admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was forbidden by the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent m@@ illenni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , members of Generation X .
the most common items that were deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 per cent stated , know@@ ingly borne items with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought illegal drugs into the plane .
the company said it asked travelers all over the country to find out how many in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently smu@@ g@@ gled goods through airport security and how many had done it deliberately .
it is no surprise that people who most likely smu@@ ggle in smu@@ g@@ gled goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry on safety , those who fly most frequently .
the company , however , points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which fluids they are allowed to take with or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the bulk of the objects confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
for a while people thought the T@@ SA could watch books as smu@@ g@@ gled goods .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care how to cancel tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers orders
electric @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to deal with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
in doing so , he has failed so far that a part of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever triumph@@ ant figures for sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la leader El@@ on Mus@@ k has revealed another less impressive number for the first time in the announcement of the latest quar@@ terly balance : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k frequently had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery just begins .
now , Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : of the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are merely non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of a cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euros ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1,000 pounds ) &quot; Reser@@ vation payment . &quot;
at the present 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations , Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to now about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .
its argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not in demand but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 , all models are to be merged - 500@@ ,000 , by 2020 one million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 bookings are available per day .
whoever orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today must expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new production lines never tested in practice without any major interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
however , if there are greater delays , then the non @-@ binding nature of the reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
EPA CEO P@@ ru@@ itt moves back because of the dela@@ ying of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , took back his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ induced air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency turned out to be more responsive to the needs of government authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint lod@@ ged against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a deadline agreed on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 O@@ zone standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay observing a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s Prosecutor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , was a reliable opponent of tough@@ er environmental protection for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly resor@@ ted to blocking or dela@@ ying regulation , which resist@@ s the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ it@@ ts regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Ju@@ dge Court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , which required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane le@@ aks .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards quite simply rein@@ forces the willingness of the EPA to co @-@ operate with the States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA often failed to meet the dead@@ lines for implementation and then waited to be indic@@ ted by activists and others , and set the date for implementation in an agreement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by legal proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority we give to us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the EPA statement said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on a sound policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress push for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
a draft bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet made in the Senate .
the New York Deputy At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of States , who had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the group intends to uph@@ old the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - after our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schnei@@ der@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this case , New York joined California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oreg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont , Washington and the District of Columbia .
floor @-@ Oz@@ on occurs when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react to sunlight in the atmosphere .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and thousands of premature deaths each year .
representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered on P@@ ru@@ it@@ ts surprising change of course .
&quot; it &apos;s wor@@ rying how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from those responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d of Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to bid on environmental poll@@ sters and their special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ ble celebrates 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , a seren@@ ade is invited to the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16 July , at 4 : 30 p.m .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be enchan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens a concern .
Walter Martin@@ i stresses : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer Ur@@ sel register : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ g@@ tei by master Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the text of the document , on the hill of Tum@@ our , apart from the former parish church , there was also a magnificent court , where the church or pat@@ ron@@ age belonged , and not the other way round .
there were also people living there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ amt Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the city image of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the magnificent sett@@ lers of the village .
old maps from the period around the year 1600 confirm these historical facts .
the pat@@ ron@@ age law arose from the early medieval self @-@ church law .
a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church .
connected with this was the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two was sh@@ at@@ tered on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over in 1942 during the Second World War .
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were cut and the bells were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ our Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from radio welding .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the church of Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demoli@@ shed .
only the steep@@ le was left .
in the New Year &apos;s Eve 18@@ 34 a storm split the steep@@ le and half fell .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed .
only the present tower of Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g was preserved as a witness of the 750 years of the old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter V@@ eil are cultiv@@ ating the Hil@@ arius facility by the &quot; Schaff@@ y Pension@@ ers &quot; as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
as organizers , the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens invite the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle on Sunday , July 16th , to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade .
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with words by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann refers to the final word .
the program starts at 4 : 30 p.m .
admission is from 3 : 30 PM .
for the closing of the seren@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organisers give out the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility , which is of importance for tum@@ ul@@ ls and hear@@ ers .
the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens feel particularly committed to home care , such as Ser@@ en@@ ade @-@ organis@@ er Walter Martin@@ i .
association wants to have permission of wind turbines to be checked
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see any legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the land rat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has called upon Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw his permit for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is un@@ lawful .
the association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved at all , as at the time in Vier@@ sen , only at the town border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal there was a wind power concentration zone .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are fundamentally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones should prevent a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; par@@ amount &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few days before , the city of Vier@@ sen had decided to change the area of land into a second wind @-@ force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette - but the district government of Düsseldorf did not appro@@ ve it because of a fault .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning law , the granted approval decision is still illegal and therefore also to be withdrawn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , President of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break , the City Council once again decided to use the wind conc@@ entri@@ c zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind energy plants is excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been received by district Vier@@ sen from last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle makes it the occasion to examine the matter again .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the city Vier@@ sen particip@@ ates indirectly , closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hect@@ are site .
with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the electricity demand of around 11 400 households is to be met - that is roughly one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ bay households .
the NEW Re plans to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind farm near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind farm in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .
car and Trac@@ tor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ dor@@ men@@ bach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was mort@@ ally wounded .
two more people were easily injured .
the road remained closed for hours .
according to the police , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch and her passenger car entered the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother .
city and retail@@ er planning &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region will re@@ discover shopping opportunities in the city center in September .
the trade association and the municipal authorities want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract residents to shopping in the city centre .
as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend aims to sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers about what offers their own city offers away from the usual supermarket commodity .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
in addition , domestic firms should present themselves with their training places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city center invite to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mitter@@ hofer shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action is not only aimed at inhabitants of the city and the region .
in preparation are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags which point to the action @-@ weekend , so Christian König .
the city administration and commercial association co @-@ operate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
in this way , the trade association and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive Center . &quot;
this includes new offerings , such as the first &quot; active day &quot; to the well festival , with sales open on Sunday , talks with all professionals and hosts , in order to move them to active participation .
also attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential is to be re@@ opened or re@@ opened .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals lost sight of the city centre when shopping .
in the end , everyone would have to contribute to li@@ ven the city centre - to land@@ lords , all the city &apos;s businesses and clubs .
it was necessary to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which had been partly wi@@ dened , and had said in the spring .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that the nationwide third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , five Thür@@ inger cities , will take part in the first time .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heili@@ gen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ er@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action conducted by the Chamber of Commerce of the I@@ HK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence its direct surroundings with its purchasing behaviour .
two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
construction work resulted in a gas explosion in the school building .
new people were injured .
in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine more wounded , some of them difficult .
according to the fire bri@@ gade on Wednesday ( local time ) , there was still a vulner@@ ability in critical condition .
a man died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed during the explosion .
a first missing was later found dead .
the dead were employees of the school .
as a matter of doubt , the authorities suspected working on a gas pipeline .
during the holiday period only a few people stayed in the building of the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy .
Tr@@ ump went bank@@ rupt initi@@ alled tran@@ scripts of phone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump announced in a telephone conversation with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president under@@ took him because he had publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to reports he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull was also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the USA refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia would be &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad , &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was im@@ par@@ ted by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he had suggested a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States .
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; that &apos;s the most unpleasant phone call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists fight racial ly@@ n@@ ch act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury ro@@ de through a group of viewers in Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , was able to reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block its way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer @-@ suit @-@ suit - took a long train on his cig@@ ar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
inside the occup@@ ants ho@@ ver@@ ed in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ aming broke the silence when a young black man was crushed by the passenger seat .
thank@@ fully , this horrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is just a night@@ mare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience ki@@ cked out very real sigh@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 citizens have come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - have been syn@@ ched by the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps organizing the post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year old con@@ gres@@ sman of the state Georgia and a lifetime citizen .
for him , the pos@@ tion serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe commun@@ ion that a wrong has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want criminal prosecution , we want to finish , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to get justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court physician places a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ne on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI agents received from N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ Process .
but no one was ever accused .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the free foot for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black citizens in Georgia to vote for their vote in the summer bal@@ lot campaign .
about the same time , according to the FBI , the black farmers , Roger Mal@@ com , stab@@ bed a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ or in the city was that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white country owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
but when they departed from prison and approached Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , concludes an FBI report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and hiding the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks puts it even more succ@@ inct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an election law massacre &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to register and if you vote , this will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has conducted the annual production of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their depic@@ tion is vivid , po@@ ign@@ ant and is rooted in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe that in America it no longer exists .
it is difficult to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about Lyn@@ ch because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I &apos;ve done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest of black - crowded into a room and listened to a well @-@ coordinated view of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of chief executive member for many years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to those times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ hid , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the test@@ ator scre@@ ams and hu@@ gs him , fur@@ ious that he had slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said n --- he , disappear from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ hid fa@@ des the fire .
there is a break .
and then everybody ( at least all black actors ) breaks out into laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ras@@ hid in@@ quired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think white people at that time &apos; n --- he &apos; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black actors was swe@@ ating . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s exactly where the energy shifts in space , a sense of compan@@ i@@ onship has replaced the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when Ras@@ mus says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman , dressed in a mour@@ ning dress , stands above the bodies of the actors and runs Bil@@ lie Holidays in mour@@ ning praise of &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice breaks at every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen viewers wi@@ pes out sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down just down the street .
they have spent nearly eight hours of Geor@@ as oppres@@ sive humidity when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch kill@@ ings took place , the air feels gh@@ ost@@ ly .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the body &apos;s name .
children sit on their heads , register the fake blood and the breast@@ feeding bodies and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they &apos;re not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he wants to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thank@@ ed the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ch rope and wipe their tears away .
Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit who has played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ ys hu@@ gs two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms weeping , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you did it for one reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience joins the actors for dinner together .
at a table , a white pair from Atlanta talks about the pos@@ ing with a black pair they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky tried to find words that left the performance behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people that look like you and who do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that Lyn@@ ch still continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called only police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks is sitting at his table , eating and remember@@ ing civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reproduction is in a certain way inspiring , because it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we learn nothing from it , it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who do not study their own history who do not know their own history are condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; re@@ conc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ reuth
also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf relies on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous production in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story backdrop .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows either a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with a wall rest and a D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from East Germany or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhein@@ thal men pos@@ ing as a rock band , or alternatively an Is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed oil drums remind of Cast@@ or &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - that goes through his &quot; ring &quot; production .
the three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise beautifully as already in &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;

Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderfully clever Ha@@ gen that surrounds the aura of a wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ box@@ er .
brutal the scene when he sm@@ iles Siegfried .
later it has to believe Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) .
the audience thanks the ensemble with a strong applause .
Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are celebrated stor@@ my ; he hum@@ bles himself and bends his hands to Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual wear .
the show was eag@@ erly awaited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 he had to pass a g@@ ellen@@ ic pipe concert , five years later there were great che@@ ers in which the scattered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls went down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have been happy about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one notices that the audience with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has grown together in a way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said just before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but also has grown an understanding of its view .
I prefer a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
max quantity working as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where anywhere ?
quantity : normally in St@@ einf@@ urt , in the furniture fair , once a week I help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked at school in the open whole day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , thus a late professional volunteer .
how does that come about ?
a lot : I did a high school .
and then a civil engineering study , let &apos;s say , successfully abor@@ ted .
I realized for myself that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something different with people working .
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
do a social year , there is an insight where you can see how it is , in the focal point , maybe also , really .
and was it like that ?
lot : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social welfare in the winter semester .
I &apos;m going to study the dual , probably in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , I &apos;m studying a social worker and studying in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you are doing your FS@@ J .
it is possible to do it from retirement home to youth work - in all aspects of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that mat@@ ured me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .
different from civil engineering studies ?
a lot : well , it &apos;s not about calcul@@ ating St@@ ati@@ ks here .
there are always other people who have a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee , be it a teen@@ ager , who has been brought out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually .
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have reservations ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
a lot of love , a lot of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s the way life is .
Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revi@@ ve business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that she will cut another 3,000 jobs and cut their interim dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure with which the company is confronted .
in addition to its previous restructuring , the job reductions attributed to the general director John Fall@@ on in late 2018 and early 2019 are in addition to his previous restructuring where 4,000 jobs have already been lost .
Pear@@ son announced in May in a third cost reduction program a cost reduction plan by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business driven by the fast pace of digital learning .
the company , which last month sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after a 1 percent increase in the first half of the year to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds .
Kab@@ ul con@@ voy &apos;s attack : NATO soldier killed at suicide bombing
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul , Afghanistan , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five soldiers and an interpreter have been injured , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said NATO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the attack in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has taken this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people close to the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in an opinion of Nato it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had occurred when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device &quot; carried by people . &quot;
the statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and treated at the US military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had carried out this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the US @-@ led forces pushed the Taliban from power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and , in particular , the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns Dec@@ ision to Del@@ ay Smo@@ g Ru@@ le after defe@@ ats
the U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , in which States are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place a day after 15 States su@@ ed the agency for the sake of stepping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone provisions of 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said they show the commitment of the agency to work with States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June P@@ ru@@ itt announced the intention of the EPA to determine the O@@ zone provisions in which pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured in a part of the country to specify where cli@@ pp@@ ings must be made to delay the stric@@ ter level of air quality - to delay a year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the Colombia district , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda that is to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of democr@@ ats and conserv@@ atives who are worried about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ing air containing o@@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
common Forum wants community room
in the end , the decision was clear : in two opposing voices , the municipal council of Flu@@ ori@@ o Win@@ ner decides to establish a common room in the future sen@@ iors residence .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing part of the property was signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
it will take a while until the church community has so far been owned by community , but now there is no need for planning for the project to be stem@@ med from a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common space for this .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - around 55 square meters - and an adjoining terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the administration and majority of the Municipal Council ho@@ vers in front of such a common space not to be seen as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the elderly @-@ righteous living , but openly in the church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided last autumn by funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area .
the establishment of a common room would be , as reported T@@ j@@ aden , capable of promoting 60 percent of 30 percent .
the proposed resolution looks at the investor to signal that in this respect it does not want to throw a stick between the legs , the statement that both sem@@ it@@ rail@@ - and the surrounding buildings - as well as a pul@@ pit - would be possible .
need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer means this addition .
when it helps : unanim@@ ously , he passes the body .
it &apos;s not as easy as the common room .
Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many buildings that are not so easy to move forward , but now they lean into the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; I am struggling with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger absolutely speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it sees behind it a hidden subsi@@ dy to either wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface there is no surplus , but I get a real counter @-@ value in the case of doubt , the counter @-@ speech is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sta@@ y@@ ers &apos;s request to track down the proposal will find three pro@@ pon@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is how it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original programme that summari@@ zes Stefan H@@ aller : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we grasp the decision , we make a giant leap to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with car : Rad@@ ler is thrown on the road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath was captured by a car and seriously injured .
as the police informed , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the bicycle track of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg from the direction of Hil@@ den approaching at 12.@@ 20 o &apos;clock .
the senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driving in the same direction was given priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road , he obviously didn &apos;t pay attention to the counter @-@ traffic .
he met with a car that controlled a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .
the man was thrown into the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a return carriage .
FC Bayern Munich has to do without Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund in the Super@@ cup at David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup will take place without him : David Al@@ aba will have to su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
with personnel safety , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory play of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the winner of the Cup .
the staff members at the German football record champion Bayern München are getting bigger before the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Po@@ cal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
coach Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti does not have to for@@ go David Al@@ aba in the du@@ el with the B@@ V@@ B .
the Italian confirmed on Friday .
the Mun@@ ch@@ men Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six trials , An@@ cel@@ sius made the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that was not good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , expecting a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights put the fans under their spell .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1.@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday .
walking in the resin from the star to the star
&quot; &quot; &quot; the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star@@ path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created in the resin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planned by the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star@@ path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is coming to meet the need for information of many visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it connects nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good @-@ to @-@ reach installations in five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber .
the information on the panels should be supplemented by the internet .
this is why a good mobile network reception has a role in the selection of locations .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later the Star@@ path Ticket to Ride is to be extended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star@@ path the viewer experienced a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also learned why stars have different colors , or why a star is more lumin@@ aire than another , even though it is much further away .
also , in which con@@ stellation is a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating the highest observ@@ atory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the National Park Har@@ z is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a Galaxy with the naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 , there is something similar to the Plan@@ etary Trail in the Uni @-@ Stadt ( Initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen ) .
starting in front of Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e that forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary Trail leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to at the end point of the d@@ warf Planet - are set exactly at the distance and the scale of one to two billion .
the Earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 metres away and measures 70 centimet@@ ers .
the entire distance from the planet path is just four kilometres .
while the light of Sun requires approximately eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the plug with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are thus faster than light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fixation would take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course in order to stage the most exciting boxing match under 147 pounds in the near future , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion who went down to Lom@@ ach@@ enko to greet the World Bo@@ xing Organisation super @-@ suspension champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through a unanim@@ ous decision on the former four Di@@ visions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; I am a former spring weight , &quot; Gar@@ cia remembered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I rose up for bronze &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to come down to light weight .
and he must move to lightweight weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
they demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko was right .
&quot; boxing takes this fight . &quot;
Kli@@ mas asked whether it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year to agree on the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell following their lightweight @-@ weight title fight in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans asked for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said , and later expressed himself openly to fight with the network offering the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he appreci@@ ates Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may be participating in his Saturday battle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the three @-@ fight champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slow , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ Aus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gar@@ cia said that the focus was to show drummer strength , then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum that built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top warri@@ ors , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured to the top of the tyre
in the case of an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were injured in part heavily on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost control over his vehicle shortly before the end of the market .
the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where it over@@ came and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were badly injured in the accident .
during the first provision of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was locked in the direction of the north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left side of the lane could be passed by the accident site .
Fort@@ una Hoffmann : &quot; three @-@ chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping for the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener for the season op@@ ener that optimi@@ zes the defense formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first round of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result as well , wouldn &apos;t have been the two oppos@@ ers at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to watch out even better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fort@@ una Düsseldorf def@@ enders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge , the three @-@ chain is to be further optimized .
and a gate after a free hit do not want to catch up the run@@ es any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future there will be no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will get better after the experiences in preparation with the three @-@ chain , than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t yet know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is confident of his cause , &quot; because we have right in the three @-@ chain at the half@@ way positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Nik@@ o Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann who can build up well , &quot; Hoffmann said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequis@@ ite is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ izing and we do not have so many playing errors in the construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can talk about a failed start , you don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we have four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the trop@@ hi@@ es , we will certainly be able to speak of a good season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know anything about that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not judge the start into the season only after six to eight playing days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to a storm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believe that the players from Au@@ e might be even a bit fres@@ her because they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an as@@ cen@@ sion favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know so 100 % where they are at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the guests from the Rhin@@ eland are considered an easy favourite on Sunday in the meeting at the finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; that we sweep it away simply because we have the right to get under the first six is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet with only one defeat against Au@@ e out of nine games is quite positive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the second Bundes@@ liga which one has to beat from the beginning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Fort@@ una Head coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; making such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el does not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results from Swedish asylum @-@ based evaluation tests published
recent results of trials for asylum seekers in Sweden submitted to a new method for medical assessment of their age show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Medic@@ inal Drug Administration ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started the tests last year .
during the asylum process , they are to take a closer look at the assessment of age after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critic@@ ised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who have been minor .
until today , migration sal@@ aries have sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 tests to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were considered 18 or older , while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under the age of 18 . &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are constant over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the figures are pretty constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there were 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the examined person was 18 years or older . &quot;
when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 results , she noted that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of the medical age assessment , in which X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a skep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they were usually preceded by pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later .
&quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
assessing biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot confi@@ dently say , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson of For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of a child as an adult is negli@@ gible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is that if the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday , a seven @-@ ton concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it works great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Head of the Road Engineering Department and Transport in the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the works began at the same time on all three bridges in need of refur@@ bish@@ ment between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is planned for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be met .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is an arch bridge made of concrete , covered with red sand@@ stone and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red sand@@ stone .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now been preserved on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.@@ 30m wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a border fast@@ ener , which is also used as operating distance .
a 2.@@ 20 @-@ metre @-@ wide bridge @-@ cap is to be used on Friday at the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is to run .
the special thing about it is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ tip feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed in advance of the work by hand@@ outs about the project .
furthermore , fish and cra@@ bs had to be f@@ ished .
for bridges between the building yard and the con@@ glomer@@ ation in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is fully closed for construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the three bridges together amount to € 700@@ ,000 .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under protest with German potato salad
it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to reconci@@ le .
the parties represented in the circle of volcanic Ei@@ fel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully this day , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle invites Ron@@ dell to a &quot; big election campaign . &quot;
and well @-@ known names start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the deputy president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ lern but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally , the town picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; was planned on the fountain square , but is now on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus right in front of the eyes of those coming to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colourful picture that is offered .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the Forum A World and one of the author@@ it@@ ative organizers , is really happy : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ur@@ alistic potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D easily , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police has ordered a lot of civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing a presence especially at the station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pe reports from the Af@@ D vul@@ can@@ ic Ei@@ fel , he tried to do such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf was first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation , because there were not enough parking spaces available because of the built @-@ up garden .
now the Ron@@ dell is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; looking at the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also a band for entertainment at around 20 o &apos;clock on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle several speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D @-@ chair@@ woman Uwe Jung .
in the hall there are about 200 people waiting for the candidate to vote for the election of the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
the police presence remains unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour , the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there it is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can press down - no special occur@@ ren@@ ces .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a meeting with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ Concer@@ tos tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church .
together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets classical German training with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ er is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both combine the desire to not only exceed the limits on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
in this way Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s world music unites with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; by the jazz musician N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free play combine to form a fascinating overall art work .
this piece of the programme was first performed with a huge success in Freiburg this spring .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart says openly about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twi@@ light &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt very bit@@ terly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin ass@@ ures the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was seriously in love with the one I have been looking for . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I &apos;ve played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after her separation Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exu@@ ality : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived and believed in du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it has never been confused or imp@@ eded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have never liked to be taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; b@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she suffered especially when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven the children told me I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now look back and think to myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public doesn &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to act in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
the Democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening in a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... Today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in ju@@ bil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ cans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a coach I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump announced a big announcement in the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes notes that he owns carbon mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the change of the Party of Gover@@ nor Justice is yet another blow to a Democratic Party , which would rather prevent us from working to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without guidance and is not able to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ NC president Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; CO@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing scandal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing scandal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be re@@ absorbed into the sport .
Russian athle@@ tics head D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF World Championships on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that he was sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were seized by competitors gold and silver med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite its comments , the IA@@ AF congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ sponsored D@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the re@@ porter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation recognized by itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; CO@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ launch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress has been made , but the Congress does support the Task Force &apos;s recommendations that it is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the World Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships , which begin on Friday in London , following the stringent IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the head of the IA@@ AF task force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to meet some of the criteria for rein@@ statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told re@@ porters in London following a speech at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ob@@ itu@@ ary for soldiers of Mali St@@ oned in Mali
at a funeral service in the North Hessen town of Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
according to Minister Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , Minister Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing about the un@@ solved crash .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they described the two opposite pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice that they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ tmann of Nord@@ h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a vi@@ gi@@ l of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Sankt Peter .
at mid@@ day only the members of the church took leave .
after that , the funeral celebration began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
the branches of mour@@ ning lay down , the relatives stood arm in the arm of the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen called the soldiers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and s@@ add@@ led in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ tmann has built the flight operations of the fighting helicopter tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment .
also Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ ch , commander of the regi@@ ment , to whom the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; if this occupation could not turn down the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show the minister of the Le@@ yen : the deployment was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral ceremony the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife after his death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what the King &apos;s House said on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried at the Ros@@ kil@@ de cathedral .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen was in agreement with her husband &apos;s decision .
it is unclear where Prince Hen@@ rik will be buried .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he retired in 2016 and also cuts the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crown Prince &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish royal court .
the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he has worked for over the past 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ bility , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in London in 1965 .
at the Th@@ ames he worked in the French embassy .
during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his nearly 50 @-@ year @-@ old reign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik stated about the first years in Denmark : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critic@@ ised . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk so@@ cks instead of knit@@ ting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ l@@ ises I smoked instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and who had the reputation in this country to be the brand of socio @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony
according to the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the Land@@ tag , Nieder@@ sachsen &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the resolution of the Parliament on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprise of a Green de@@ pu@@ ties from their Land@@ tag fraction in Lower Saxony had pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Land@@ tag elections the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ voice majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
El@@ ke T@@ ests , a former Green Party member , founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover .
Ms. Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler , CD@@ U leader , wants to recommend his Group to include her .
with that , CD@@ U and F@@ DP together with 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats would have .
so far , the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag is regularly elected on the 14th of January next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether it could go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Stephan Wei@@ l believes it is indispensable that the Land@@ tag decides to resolve its own self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible .
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; state Constitution also provides the opportunity for the Prime Minister to withdraw his trust and elect a successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; our Constitution provides several options .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these options must be checked legally clean , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will calm@@ ly discuss all the questions if they are properly examined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ West &apos;s step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something kur@@ i@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens called for the dissi@@ dent legis@@ lators to return their country &apos;s mandate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we assume that it returns its agricultural mandate , which it has received via the Green Land List , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president Met@@ a Jans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group leader Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has deliberately decided not to speak pron@@ unci@@ ation in the group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the resignation of the Lower Saxony Green Party members El@@ ke T@@ ests as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Green Party members in Lower Saxony is not only treas@@ on to voters , but also treas@@ on to red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the German Social @-@ Democrats leader on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly choose the Land@@ tag .
the exit of T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politicians &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their van@@ qu@@ ished vanity and in their fru@@ stration are their personal interests before the good of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD general secretary Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a scandal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony particip@@ ates in this dirty trick game and tries to make it political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nieder@@ sachsen &apos;s CD@@ U leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ ests in the CD@@ U .
the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , designed v@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the results of the 2013 Land@@ tag election with personal career gifts .
the CD@@ U was at that time the strongest power in front of the SPD , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of a vote in the Parliament day .
Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ si@@ es , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discusses poll@@ uted eggs .
how could the scandal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
the Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , talks and answers in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mr. Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp printed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ gro@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the eggs @-@ bat@@ ches concerned .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , after all , what we are currently aware of is a health hazard practically excluded .
Al@@ di now takes over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of supply - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
in spite of this , my house has turned up@@ side down and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany &apos;s dis@@ miss@@ al .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
as well as the manufacturers , trade has to ensure that the products sold are traffic @-@ capable and harmless to health .
if the residual oil content of eggs exceeds 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are non @-@ transfer@@ able .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and eaten .
this time , the companies are not to blame .
are production companies and consumers in the same boat ?
as far as knowledge is concerned , production plants do not meet any direct debt .
on the contrary , they have to reck@@ on with economic damage as a result of presum@@ ed illegal practices of service providers .
as always , there is too little control in the emergency .
is it missing only in the personnel or also in conclu@@ sive competence ?
it was precisely the official controls that revealed the process .
however , the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent ruled out .
it is precisely for this reason that a consistent education of such events and the transfer to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases in which crimes can be present are of crucial importance .
I have already made it clear that I expect a complete clari@@ fication by the responsible authorities .
is regular al@@ arms really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and market@@ able food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are justified by law .
by means of the pan@@ eled means , manufacturers , traders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
in general , it must be clear that the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide ir@@ radi@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ sustain@@ ing animals is intol@@ erable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
you have to work consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all relevant authorities that the facts are solved spe@@ edi@@ ly and comprehen@@ sively .
how the finance rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded expenditure on European football associations will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come from the UEF@@ A for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main , as the guiding organization who over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious champi@@ ons league tournament .
financial Fair Play Reg@@ ulations that were launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without major losses .
Barcelona paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( $ 26@@ 2 million ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans out of its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can make money easy for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign up and bring him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , in view of the financing of the team by the energy @-@ rich ruling family of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players , but have to deal with legitimate income sources that allow them to break even the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs which had taken enormous debts in their quest for success effectively che@@ ated and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P declined from concentrating on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , which Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P investment period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses amoun@@ ting to 30 million euros .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen in favour of the presi@@ dency in 2015 , its successor , Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to dis@@ courage excessive expenditure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will surely reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for FF@@ P at the UEF@@ A , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G has paid the Buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the sum total of € 4@@ 4.4 million can be accounted for in the financial statements for the next five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 brought the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( $ 82 million at that time ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a cat@@ astrop@@ hic company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ship should exceed the standard market sets , UEF@@ A would not allow this to be considered a legitimate income .
this is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the P@@ SA sponsor@@ ship was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments of the organizing committee of the World Cup 20@@ 22 in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 20@@ 22 have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar WM will be ambassador and such a manoeu@@ vre for UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could easily be figured out .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to ignore any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , announ@@ cing on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they talked about the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than € 10 million with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
accounts for the last fiscal year have to be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ship deals , merchan@@ dising and tri@@ cot sales .
the association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after signature .
the Spanish League was clearly labeled to see one of the best football players , and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of the La League , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar &apos;s last ownership stake in PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La League against a state financed by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the past 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financing of Fair@@ play because it is possible to have different ways or have different interests , if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new sho@@ oter supplier
in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board chocolate has produced Swiss @-@ style chocolate .
now the sweet cooperation is facing a possible end : the airline is re@@ writing the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss speaker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott also confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very happy with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the speaker .
about 17 million tiny sho@@ cking sho@@ cks of 14 grams are distributed each year before landing on passengers .
the Swiss did not want to give any information about the costs .
according to &quot; North West Switzerland , &quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of about 1 billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a sho@@ oter manufacturer .
the Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants have submitted it to the new tender .
but only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y will endeav@@ our to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018 .
for the s@@ da the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not achiev@@ able for a comment .
Swiss have been distributing chocolate bars on board their flights since 2006 .
before signing a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had supplied the chocolate tablet in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
Swiss Life took the opportunity to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline co@@ operates with various Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights , First Class customers will be spoiled with goo@@ dies from the Spr@@ ün@@ gli Con@@ fis@@ erie , in the business class nas@@ al passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i by Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i also distri@@ butes Scho@@ gg@@ i from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and economy class .

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ gr@@ unge era ( as the pioneer David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ et@@ ch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd were going to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era of permanent memories .
but as a fran@@ chise it feels like time is running out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd hum@@ ors ( it contained an original story for a speaking can of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by focusing on the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play cool kids who grow up - yet they have the im@@ possibility to win the final part of the W@@ itz@@ es back .
ten Years L@@ ater , with his adults , who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more according to the watering pattern principle , including a riff on Stal@@ ker &apos;s films of the 90 &apos;s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; Die Hand That Ke@@ eps the Cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
at one point , a character runs through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the am@@ i@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now a novel@@ ist , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there &apos;s another crazy evil plot involved in Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ done impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s underwater beard of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singles &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; whose former big @-@ man @-@ on @-@ camp Andy is now feeling like an old boy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s the moments of random ins@@ an@@ ity that could heat up this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he achieves what I see as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band premiere of W@@ et Hot American Summer .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of Cold War by &quot; The Americans , &quot; the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East versus West w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography .
the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka as director gives us the chance to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alo@@ gues are synchron@@ ised by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ uting producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is an ingenious idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are a few beautiful g@@ ags to look at ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Find out the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Re@@ agan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
with six long episodes , it moves along , and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been reduced to a lesser length , could better deliver his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef keep visiting the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for food .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian authors were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger story and with thei@@ rs .
sla@@ p against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police shot a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosec@@ utor Con@@ stance filed on Friday .
in doing so , 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and had already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , the officers established larger quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros .
two people were arrested in Italy during the same raid in Italy .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans .
the two will probably be extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the campaign .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the members of the Maf@@ ia are accused of organized trafficking of drugs , heavy acts of violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
as early as summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office established Con@@ stance against organised drug trade in southern Germany .
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Cri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , the Grand Prix was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning .
the aim of the investigations was mainly Italian nationals with close relation to the Italian Maf@@ ia .
also a incident on 27th May in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning , is likely to go to the bonds bank account .
large gaps in the for@@ eigner &apos;s register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not show up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreign registry office in Germany shows significant defici@@ encies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to partly serious mis@@ decisions regarding asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the commission@@ er for the refugee management of the German government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , pointed out to a large number of gaps in the Aus@@ länder@@ behörde .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grave wrong decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations , warned in an analysis of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Register , ten million people with foreign citizenship are registered in the register , including around 5.@@ 7 million people from non @-@ EU countries .
the data will therefore be administered by approximately 600 Ali@@ ens Auth@@ orities in Germany .
because the data have not been sufficiently maintained , the quality of data has not been good in parts so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases data from 1921 were found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of people who are no longer in life , or by citizens who have become German citizens and should actually no longer appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faulty data input may slow down return processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statistics on sufficient people are also included in EU citizens who don &apos;t have to leave at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such false arrangements , however , led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a distorted debate on how to deal with sufficient &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is therefore stated in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children , when they came from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results from an internal paper of the Federal Office of Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper it is said that the BA@@ MF is conducting such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 this was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper referred to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees who first reach them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a immig@@ rant continues to travel to another EU country , this state can send it back to the entry @-@ country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the office now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other EU states would also send asylum to refugees as part of the Dublin Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the domestic spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ hand faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised the decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children are threatened because of the defici@@ encies in the Italian asylum system of un@@ lawful reception conditions and a threat to child welfare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 liters of blood from people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach already provided blood donation service to other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now donated 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations .
traditionally , in the meeting of the council , the community hon@@ ors multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ingenious how our body is designed for it and we pay respect for the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the Regional Development Manager of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the c@@ anned foods are de@@ composed into their constitu@@ ents .
so three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Mais@@ man reported about the actions carried out in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in the spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K district manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the change in the theatre house led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
already before , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ rel were among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 contributions in donated blood .
half as many as Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter emit@@ ted ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their life @-@ juice .
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England will probably later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation about an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members reaching a rise in this month , as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment .
in its quar@@ terly inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and 1.6 % in 2018 , and warned that the pressure on budget@@ ary income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to almost 3 % in the fall .
but she sign@@ aled that interest increases would be necessary over the next few years to cur@@ b the inflation of inflation and she said that loan costs would have to rise more than expected on the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw part of the mamm@@ oth economic package issued a year ago after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for the financial plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks as of the upcoming February , although it has been said that it is now expected that it will provide £ 15 billion more within the framework of this system - with £ 115 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to imp@@ air consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the interest rates it repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be required to cool inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bigger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the bank emphas@@ ised that increases would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts , adjusted down@@ wards for this and next year , are 1.9 % and 1.7 % projected in May .
it has maintained its forecast for growth of 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro .
the pound dropped by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and dropped by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision for no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rise in interest rates and increased GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although the Bank will recover slightly towards the end of the year .
the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households to be affected by rising inflation and marginal increase in salary as the tigh@@ tening first becomes worse before it improves .
she added that in the coming years , monetary policy will not &quot; a@@ vert &quot; the income tax , but she added that wages will recover significantly at the end of her three @-@ year forecasts .
the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound , which will offset some of the lower consumer spending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the sin@@ king of the pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until it will fully reach the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final decision on interest rates , the call for interest rates increased as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase of 0.5 % in July .
inflation decreased from 2.@@ 9 % in June last month to 2.6 % in June , although the bank said this was expected and will attract them over the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said the exceeding in proportion to its goal of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attributable to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the recent return of the Swa@@ p install@@ ments , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the len@@ ders are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market is particularly good for those with whom the existing deals are exp@@ iring and the new mort@@ g@@ ages are closed , and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment in September following a fight against the High Court against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that a Pre@@ p Pre@@ vention Pre@@ vention ( pre@@ p ) , which was taken before the intercourse , can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , now being delivered by healthcare through a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p , despite the asser@@ tion that local authorities should fund him .
the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England CEO Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an important new intervention , while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as the &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to permit the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ p Pre@@ vention ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in risk of infection .
to take pre@@ p before intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or as long as two hours prior to sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people living in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will sign £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of the drugs this week following an international competitive purchase .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , how it is systematically used , recorded and implemented on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in dealing with one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pre@@ p , when targeted towards needy and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is quickly carried out across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that pre@@ p test medicine was obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and hes@@ it@@ ating implementation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is conducted as quickly as possible across the country to protect people infected with HIV and that it will contribute to a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , res@@ ized in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it wasn &apos;t just about building a simple platform , but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement made it possible to place two rooms at full height above each other - with much additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to allow it to work for longer .
in the kitchen , the reflection feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little bit of engineering went inside , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s important , so when you push the door , it gli@@ des very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a vesti@@ gi@@ al form , a real estate agent will enter and conduct a calculation based on the floor size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor space while at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that touch you and therefore help create an emotional attachment to a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t de@@ ar@@ est into the electrical sockets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of some standard in something quite amazing .
indeed , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave this .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty in a confrontation over one of the largest real estate imperialist Vic@@ tori@@ as worth more than $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and assets should be split .
Paul wanted to reti@@ re from family operations since 2014 , but a sharp conflict about the separation takes place at the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers acquired 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there , the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 to USD 85 million .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De LU@@ TI@@ S now encompasses offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her dead father Col@@ in - Paul describes as &quot; principal operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a court record states that Col@@ in owns property worth 3@@ 16 million dollars and Paul worth $ 17@@ 6 million .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed attempts , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers now also struggle to control the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul asser@@ ts , has excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to manage some possessions in@@ competent .
in an early affair , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian inheritance stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs rise in the case of hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ it@@ te , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and law firms held on both sides .
Mrs. De LU@@ TI@@ S and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran dairy and delic@@ at@@ essen shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first den@@ im of the family .
Col@@ in says he began West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De LU@@ TI@@ S says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to share her property to her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land before judgment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S group of companies , whereas Col@@ in claims that Mark paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million when leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , Paul says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bit@@ tern@@ ess on the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in held back very well although he was a former AF@@ L member of the board and after a biography of the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , he was the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the case is in front of the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to meet his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not wish that Paul and I would end up in our current fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our issue will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Chief of Staff is planning to cur@@ tail the president &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , it will be the first .
Politi@@ co reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on an even more uniform course .
here is a piece by re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior officials on his first day of work , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump White House , which he wanted to repair : poor information that was placed in the president &apos;s hands .
Kelly said to the staff that information should flow on him - whether on paper or brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring its media density .
President Tr@@ ump@@ y &apos;s relationship with television reaches decades back - and now , wherever he is in the White House , his television commerci@@ als are still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Tr@@ ump was angry with unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were to convince , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said former electoral advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Politi@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Politi@@ co Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep the Twitter habit under control , according to six former electoral campaigns , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that the Twitter habit was ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps these campaign officials do not know what we do not know others - that without their interventions , tr@@ umps would have contained even more combus@@ ti@@ bles .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his employees were making it a few times to keep anger away from him , their efforts paid off .
but no one has consistently prevented the creation of Tr@@ ump controversi@@ es .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , are trying to advance their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that could possibly promote their views from the world .
in May , Politi@@ co - dealing entirely with this story - reported about the preference of advis@@ ers to the president for strategic reasons without doub@@ t@@ ful information .
this was an example described by re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press cli@@ pp@@ ings like a volcano , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and find out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly what happened at the end of February when someone had mal@@ ici@@ ously accused the president of a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently ban@@ ished from Twitter for har@@ ass@@ ment or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and began to question staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ makers added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work and to document the dump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence .
these un@@ changeable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals receive mail from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped for .
during this summer ( virtual ) postcards , the police all over Europe are sending postcards to dangerous criminals on the run .
since the addresses of the searched s@@ words are not known , information from the population is hoped and requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday about the action on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advent calendar from the winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences would have shown that there were many fle@@ eting to holiday destinations , it was said by Euro@@ pol .
21 postcards were compiled for criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online search@@ ers could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to indications after the publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire range &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est house owners in West Mid@@ lands are standing again with some resol@@ ute travellers on war feet , who have negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn by the community to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous road called Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Million@@ aire Series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a tren@@ ch dug by the Council to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defense systems and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have urged the advice of Soli@@ hull , who said that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous owner said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they moved there on Monday evening after they were sent to Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be compelled by shame to implement it , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , were moved and are now back again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more arrived yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Birmingham Council knows how to handle it by holding long instruction to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my community tax if the Council cannot stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a local who didn &apos;t want to be called , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one spokes@@ woman of the council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps to move them as quickly as possible .
in order to support our evidence collection , it is very important that as many residents as possible announce an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps create an image of the situation in which the court must consider when we submit our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof , Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is located . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then Ambiente Betriebs@@ gesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also income from the tourist tax .
in autumn 2014 , in view of the dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the county , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation to the district council , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not disputed at that time in the municipal council .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and even then spoke of serious interested parties at the house .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with managing director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you will be called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has been building sh@@ utt@@ les in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renovation works are made .
the floors were torn out , ceilings broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be re@@ done in the Black Forest Style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer is expressing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities .
one does not want to position itself at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at an up@@ scale downtown level , Sch@@ erer emphasizes .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide , Sch@@ erer explains further .
both individual holi@@ day@@ makers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable at the hotel .
he has already conducted talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and director of the Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer .
the city &apos;s performances are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to define himself precisely after the investments have been made .
he pays less than a million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the external investments are also brought to the fore , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace develops , which will be accessible from the restaurant which is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : U.S. Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator sets Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US president Donald Tr@@ ump , special gene@@ alog@@ ist Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
the committee has resum@@ ed the work in recent weeks , writes the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; calling on people familiar with the matter .
the newspaper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has wi@@ dened and intensified his investigation .
the CN@@ N broad@@ caster reported that there are already first sum@@ m@@ aries of the committee in connection with a meeting between the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
us intelligence agencies have long accused the Krem@@ lin of interfer@@ ing with the 2016 presidential election campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between the election campaign team and Moscow .
the investigation focused on several men who acted as advis@@ ers to the Republi@@ cans during the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller took a close look at more and more tr@@ umps as a private and business environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator Tr@@ ump went personally to the centre and investigate whether the president could possibly hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to prove this evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether prosecution is to be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called the Prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
most of the time , they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always done behind closed doors .
the body can also be engaged by the public prosec@@ utor in order to invite individuals to take an oath .
according to CN@@ N , previous invitations have been issued which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were asked to testify , called it in the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
along with Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ ump advis@@ ers and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his head @-@ in @-@ law , Paul Man@@ a@@ fort , were in the conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the sub@@ stitution shows that Mu@@ eller would not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary , he would act quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charging of an indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the suspension of the committee was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for president Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revelations , the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russian history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the issue gives the democr@@ ats a chance to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else about which they can talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b , explained in a statement that he did not know anything about the establishment of a Grand Jury .
but he also usually works in secret , he emphas@@ ised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House endor@@ ses all measures that expe@@ dite the work of the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that it was not against the president . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one has no reason to believe that something has changed , so it continued in the statement .
Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this ration@@ ality , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have become loud , he has obstruc@@ ted the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said in June of a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump has asked him to set up investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees .
that spark@@ ed speculation as to whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to release Mu@@ eller .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the late President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the President &apos;s margins .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
there were two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators on Thursday that the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ators could no longer be released so easily .
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
in the western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has been solved by the narrow@@ ly seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from the ice shelf .
this was shared by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the Kol@@ oss , weighing over a tri@@ l@@ lion of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving to the north and will probably need two or three years until it has melted .
with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered in the past three decades .
there is no danger to human beings .
according to research data , the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demoli@@ tion of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear .
in total , however , for some 30 years there have been a series of unusual bur@@ sts of ice @-@ s@@ nu@@ ps in the region , writes the US research centre for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus has been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ sla@@ b so far .
Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ l swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .
it continues to grow further into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ sla@@ b is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this shelf life was disturbed by the balance of wa@@ xing and ab@@ sten@@ tion a few years ago .
A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes a complete ice shelf .
it is worth mentioning that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ice shelf is also in danger , because the front edge has never dropped as far as it is currently .
in addition , the ice plate is under tension and can be broken if a piece breaks down at a key point .
the melting of ice shelf and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and squee@@ ze ice as much water as it produces after melting .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project on the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ sla@@ b is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antar@@ cti@@ ca after A@@ WI data with nearly 50,000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks periodi@@ cally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most popular retreat since the beginning of records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also affir@@ med . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; scientists have argued whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf will grow back or fall back in the long term and possibly collapse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these researchers do not bring back the departure of this giant ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has fallen apart in recent decades .
this long skirt of the Antar@@ ctic stretches in the direction of South America .
according to the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the rise in temperature contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has been warming up around three degrees in the past 50 years and is counting on the areas where the temperature is the fastest .
CD@@ U wants to make house ari@@ f at staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ant jobs , the CD@@ U demands to step out of the employers &apos; association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , 41 new jobs in the administration had penet@@ rated 41 new positions .
more than 1,@@ 100 cler@@ ks and civil servants are working for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have had their first day of work .
the apprentices@@ hips in the circle are obviously very much sought after .
some 6@@ 20 applications for the places to be presented this year were to be recorded .
nevertheless , the group is still lacking personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at present , there are still 50 un@@ occupied positions in the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as general administration forces .
the CD@@ U would now want to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the request of the parties , the administration should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term needs for skilled workers but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application shortage .
the overall concept should orient@@ ate internally and extern@@ ally , demonstrate concrete measures for cross @-@ entry and include a training initiative , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you did not know before .
other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speech is from a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , there is a high number of employees who reti@@ re from the service of disease or age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s high time for action so that there are no more places left un@@ occupied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Fuhr@@ mann , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint motion with his party .
he caused a bad surprise already in the circle day , when he publicly challenged the personnel costs and the other parties star@@ tled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want all opportunities to be reviewed which allow an exit from the local employers &apos; association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not arrive at short notice to a satisfactory solution , the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated cities - should aim for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way the CD@@ U is trying to pay better the employees and officials when it actually envis@@ ages the tari@@ ff for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money is only available if you move to a higher level , which is oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Protection Act .
last but not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hen@@ del and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little personnel .
Italy exac@@ erb@@ ates the tone of NGO @-@ migrants &apos; lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs who use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea , warned that they cannot continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Home Secretary Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis &apos;s warning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their team had worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on the Italian prosec@@ utor Am@@ bro@@ gio Carto@@ sio &apos;s extensive alle@@ gations .
&quot; for us , the salvation of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; the organisation said in a statement on the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only assess all accus@@ ations currently being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Youth Ret@@ tet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is suspected that its crew will ship ding@@ h@@ y migrants to be delivered directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart for the ships to be used again .
at least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s file whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of over@@ riding the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue missions in the area for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must first have an Italian police officer who supervis@@ es their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have previously agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; significant changes or disabilities &quot; to their rescue operations .
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Minn@@ iti has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures in Italy had declined sharply in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days , we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to achieve Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; &quot; &quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bik@@ er , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the northern Pfalz for four days to enjoy tri@@ als and sights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ - und W@@ einf@@ est by Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest and the up@@ stream plains .
in between there were repeat@@ ed@@ ely longer climbs , for the long tri@@ als reward .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and the folk festival saus@@ age market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; again , a view point rested on the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the last two days many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced again .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refu@@ ges brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed sal@@ ine sal@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .

console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga matches e @-@ sport
do the sports stars in the future sit in front of computer consoles , instead of swe@@ ating through the stadium racing at wind and weather ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long been a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high ga@@ des included .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these have also recognised the first federal states that are increasingly involved in this field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the beginning made the V@@ f@@ B Wolfs@@ burg in 2015 , followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sports department in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are still several clubs rising on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the FIFA World Cup in London organised the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the gam@@ ers of various clubs compete against each other next weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven are qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sports .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen meanwhile has consul@@ ted an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real football must deal with the 14 to 30 year olds in particular , that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send to Asia only once a year .
what is it all about ?
at E @-@ Sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the soccer simulation FIFA will be cont@@ ested at competitive level .
as in normal sports , long ago , le@@ agues have become established in which the pros compete against each other .
and in the Asian Games in 20@@ 22 e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a proper kind of sport ?
for many , the idea is certain to get used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ats has also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and showing many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classic sports such as increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
it also requires cognitive skills , a technical and tactical insight , and a fast response capability .
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console , but also exercise their body and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fit@@ te player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but craw@@ ling also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to perform on online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing .
the scientist emphasizes the high integr@@ ative effect of the E @-@ sport .
the players are on the move internationally , that &apos;s like a big global family , because there are no inter@@ cultural barriers .
a study by the company advisory company Del@@ o@@ it@@ te and the Federal Association for Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in e @-@ sports .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ship and large tournaments .
in three years , sales are expected to be at EUR 130 million .
this is little against the 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the e @-@ sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Del@@ o@@ it@@ te consultants write . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many countries are already on the move .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eball player Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e @-@ sports bet@@ ting company Uni@@ kr@@ s .
there is also a lot happening in Europe .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a teaching subject , says F@@ rob@@ ber .
in the Netherlands and in France , the soccer league associations , according to D@@ utt , are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sports department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany is la@@ gging behind in Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says V@@ f@@ B board member R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to decay in nostal@@ gia , and to clarify the old times , is no longer enough today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but at the same time align the company with the modern market .
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says D@@ utt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t stick to the fact that only football stays as it was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter sentenced to suicide because of the lyrics Con@@ rad Roy re@@ members
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls to commit suicide .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June for the negli@@ gent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; my son was my best friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his appeal .
she had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream coloured bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter was standing there with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her actions have changed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she took no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she showed no regret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance which they depl@@ ore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Ju@@ dge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find out that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy saying that there is &quot; no day in which I do not spend the loss of my beloved son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I move with everything . I try to be there for eternity in spite of all my pain that we will carry for eternity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , testi@@ fied that she was &quot; persecuted &quot; by the realization that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or would be a a@@ unt for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not having this single person with whom I was together every day since I was born , is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case appears to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to urge another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a car in 2014 .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ter &apos;s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to finish his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jump up , spring from a building , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is turn the generator on and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was sought by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder on her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Joshua Kim@@ mich : learning from the new &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mini @-@ Lah@@ m &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of FC Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot;
that Joshua Kim@@ ber was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup is no accident .
the FC Bayern will win a big season to the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm .
something was different in his place in the cabin , which looked at Joshua at once , even though the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er could be seen , he made the rush to his arm .
&quot; the trainer did not announce it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner afterwards , after his first deployment as Bavaria @-@ captain .
good , the stand could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign from the coach could hint at me .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal had been chosen as a player guide in the C @-@ El@@ f from youth players , de@@ vot@@ ees and especially from the holiday .
sugar l is best distributed to those who want to keep a lot of people who want to keep you in a good mood .
those who have been chosen to take the inheritance of Lah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
Kim@@ mich confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old flew over the field as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m .
to the right rear , that is his position , the white band@@ age did the rest .
and Kim@@ mich sat in such a position as the one who can best take the helm in his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ trained trou@@ pe .
he had the look for the whole while many others were busy with himself .
V@@ idal &apos;s inability to re@@ play his missing fitness ( hardly collap@@ sed ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches pointed out to the devil to get out of the achievements of the Asia trip ( also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le do not fall neg@@ atively in their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t .
after all , it worked very well .
Sü@@ le ran beside Kim@@ mich , Ru@@ dy before the defense , both acted confi@@ dently .
the nam@@ eless Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and in addition Sü@@ le tried a few times in the game design .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy ad@@ mitt@@ edly admitted that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we have hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a good performance at his debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game relo@@ cation , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style , I was also picked up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as unusual as this Bayern @-@ World is still for the new entran@@ ces , one sees in the connection to the game .
Ru@@ dy , for example , did not give one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ ber said goodbye to his new fellow players after a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard an interesting proposition from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win each game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : Wirtschaft lo@@ ges Wis@@ dom speed
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is shown after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region talk to T V enquiry from a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister .
Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier Corpor@@ ations ( V@@ TU ) , says , &quot; Wis@@ sing addresses the needs of the economy that blocked Lem@@ ke all . &quot;
the biggest turn@@ around sees nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the priority list of the country .
this year the Ministry is hoping for a planning procedure until 2021 is supposed to stand construction law .
a role in the plans of the country is also allu@@ ding to the West@@ um@@ geh@@ ung Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the national transport timetable .
the goal was to put the circuit into operation in December 2020 , says Ministeri@@ al spokes@@ woman Cor@@ nel@@ ia Hol@@ tmann .
nat@@ us sees in this sign a sign to support regional , but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier aims , as was suggested by Wis@@ sing , to produce a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German exports falling for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , praise the Chamber of Commerce .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees in the new Master Bonus an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a bonus of 1000 euro is planned for the passed master test and 2500 Euro , if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years after the master &apos;s training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
at the planned road construction , facts are to be created quickly , at the same time it lacks the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , chief executive officer of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier .
only 29 positions have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to employ Wis@@ sing at the state @-@ run mobility .
the Chamber of Industry calls for more jobs to be allocated to external offices .
Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , CD@@ U vice @-@ president , points to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country investing more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018 .
in addition , Frank nat@@ us is also expecting a concept of the country as it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
further broad@@ band expansion in the country is also sober@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies only rated the grid supply in an I@@ HK survey only with a score of 3,@@ 4 .
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant Internet connections and qu@@ arri@@ es .
ex @-@ Minister for Economic Affairs , E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green faction left Lem@@ ke for April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where after four months of in@@ consisten@@ cies it cleared the field again .
Audi has to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
the BMW leader said that &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; and moved to European cities - including Munich where BMW is located - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the undertaking as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des which em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ ogenic and can cause asthma .
the costs for car manufacturers , systems for neutr@@ alizing the exhaust gases emit@@ ted by diesel vehicles , also increase what makes it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of losing the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called write @-@ off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but to return to normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were indic@@ ted , others are being examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circum@@ vent emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States was expanded .
the involvement of Audi in the investigation could seriously strain Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer greatly contributes to Volkswagen &apos;s profit .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft goes to Munich on Saturday , which has a special message .
if there is again on Saturday the Is@@ ar , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and this is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar @-@ tourists .
but the Construction Department wants to clarify .
on the raft one sees a large inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a garbage mountain .
the kick @-@ off to an ou@@ tre@@ ach campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar should be sharpen@@ ed as a desirable wild flow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer the raft sailed over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behaviour .
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll &apos;s n@@ oses and the laughter of the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ ons , the no@@ stri@@ ls of his characters are his trademark .
even with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ er still draws and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laugh , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ ill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immig@@ rant in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he suggested himself as a dra@@ fts@@ man for congrat@@ ulating cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said once . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he made his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again , the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures tum@@ ble in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he is still sitting at the drawing table today , working almost ten hours a day .
over cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and clo@@ cks still find its funny characters wide spread worldwide .
for six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters .
the main character in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los &apos;s most popular animal in his drawings - who has a jack @-@ of @-@ all as a counterpart .
for the first time , his figures show in the 3D film , which is to come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
this is why he relies more on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without a word .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions which are reminiscent of d@@ rought and due to diseases transmitted by scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , causing great headaches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively at risk , because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a small ic@@ cade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium , which transfers the Little Go@@ c@@ lei@@ ades , and in the case of very dry weather , there are many of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there is much on the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the solutions considered include a better distribution of water and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also spra@@ ying plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to d@@ rought .
the small town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian border is celebrating its 1@@ 200@@ th anniversary this year .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly Ri@@ jek@@ a are usually meeting wed@@ n@@ esday in order to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the State of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists are discussing what feels safer : they should take their children into the office , which in 2009 were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .
they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the government &apos;s salary list or car@@ tels , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no break from violence , and while throughout the country the bodies are pil@@ ing up , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to took office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are following attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven states this year .
among the latter is her editor and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ jek@@ a , co @-@ founder of Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez also wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep , although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; hanging on the facade of the Ri@@ jek@@ a building . two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a German Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists only launched two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of mur@@ ders linked every year to drug trafficking and organised crime , journalists are rarely brought to justice by journalists .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ comfor@@ ting and even though the terrain is still more tre@@ ach@@ erous .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we di@@ str@@ ust everybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez moved the office of the newspaper Ri@@ jek@@ a to the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ ve River . &quot;
the S@@ agit@@ tari@@ us drove away in his car and damaged it close .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a wife and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields in the country , as rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of adorned , two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; if only a car@@ tel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken by guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings contributed to the murder .
first there was the publication of an interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival card fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , suspected gang members bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was not forcing Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own security after the confis@@ cation of another newspaper publishing the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing was considered a milestone in Mexican aggression against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for the Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined five colleagues for the establishment of Ri@@ jek@@ a and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug poison problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising grew .
re@@ porters liked to be able to publish hard @-@ fitting investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ jek@@ a , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee on the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in prosec@@ uting the Mexican drug story wherever she was leading .
he willingly admitted that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug trade in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must take on the task that you like as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who could curse like a do@@ ck@@ worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and sit there at the same table .
now they ask : was his love for routine his destruction ?
his death forced them to question their own assumptions about how they best carry out their work and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like to deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret run@@ ways and run@@ ways to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
if it smells bad , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ jek@@ a Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be fo@@ ol@@ ed ... and then the thing happened with Ja@@ vier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gled smu@@ g@@ gled , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the room where staff from Ri@@ jek@@ a met for safety training , there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed . days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ jek@@ a in a four @-@ storey building in a middle @-@ class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked themselves if these officers were among the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who the governor was not trust@@ worthy .
it has been months since the re@@ porters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ jek@@ a has spent three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former famous xer Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é on government spending , focusing on the governor &apos;s hom@@ etown .
and there was a group that was in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , led through a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word on who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knows : that the restaurant is a favorite pub of drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was recorded under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled almost all the political levels almost the entire century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ profile cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this pub , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military raid .
just a few months earlier , the readers would have viewed the column of Val@@ dez as the most informed source of ab@@ duction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body keyboard . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all communication channels are broken with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for notes and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped up a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning for another journalist for the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing that it is its .
journalists all over the country have become lou@@ der by writing down in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings .
on that day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez goes away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the Val@@ dez case .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying journalists and killing them because they told the truth .
she has since asked for her to be re @-@ divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by organised crime , government officials and an in@@ different society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the Media W@@ äch@@ ter@@ gruppe &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep the mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;

din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening one .
researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian min@@ er have been preserved so well that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so good that they could even notice that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said she had had something of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; troubled past &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , living in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years .
his unbeliev@@ ably well preserved condition has amazed researchers who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he founded the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
he met something that seemed missing from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .
the F@@ ossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years discovering the wild animal in the 2500 pound ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) of heavy earth cl@@ ots .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you only b@@ link a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chief author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rier . &quot;
researchers found out that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although it is covered with arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , was probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as a counter @-@ burial , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed him to get better in his surroundings and to avoid his enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it has been threatened by bigger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made head@@ lines in May and is now in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ with@@ ch@@ elli according to the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to discover it carefully .
the amazing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the counter sh@@ ading , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter@@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds the animals today living .
it points out that the din@@ osau@@ rs were hun@@ ted by din@@ osau@@ rs eating enough pressure that evolution favor@@ ed the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the counter sh@@ ading - think of roe deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , which sign@@ alizes that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs prey must have been , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was red@@ dish brown .
scientists continue to examine the animal for clu@@ es about his life , including his preserved intest@@ ine , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and pushed out into the sea , where he sank on his back to the se@@ abed .
at this time Alber@@ ta was as warm as South Fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are probably more widespread inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is truly remarkable , because it is completely covered with con@@ served sc@@ aly skin but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; Brown said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just squ@@ int a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is asleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when huge thermal di@@ odes , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
to this belongs the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he buried at the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from mu@@ zzle to hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that hung from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous was swept through Western Canada , until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ nants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains cover still b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rare as a win in lot@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ nants of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates bearing the skull of the animal .
his right front foot rests on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can count the scales at his sole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass w@@ reck@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
violent accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : just under 30 vehicles are involved in a mass collision .
there are numerous wounded , kilometres long roads - and G@@ aff@@ er .
around 20 people were injured on the Autobahn in Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) on Thursday afternoon .
according to the first indications of the police , between the jun@@ ctions of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm almost 30 vehicles , among them probably trucks , crashed into one another .
the exact number of injured parties first did not provide any information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a matter of light to moderate injuries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large array of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of travel Munich was a round ten kilometres long back @-@ sta@@ u .
as reported by an A@@ Z re@@ porter , it also came on the opposite rail to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ gade reported the car drivers &apos; registration plates , which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 o &apos;clock a second accident happened on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : uns@@ us@@ p@@ ecting you are sitting in the train and sleeping .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ ered .
if the conductor comes and w@@ akes an uns@@ us@@ p@@ ected , or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket control .
you simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and thus vali@@ date your ticket .
currently , a test run is running on two tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer arrives , we expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available on many other long @-@ distance routes in Germany in the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway nar@@ rator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the train ticket de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to be able to use this , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do anyway .
it is also necessary to buy the DB Navig@@ ator app , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway .
and finally , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : you go to the train , call his ticket at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the test customers then have a button for the electronic de@@ valuation .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants receive a message on their mobile devices that passengers X is in the train and took the booked seat Y .
when the train companion arrives at the ticket inspection at Place Y , he knows that a passenger is sitting there with an already vali@@ dated online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , continue working , keep silent .
the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train cabin crew , simply check in the DB Navig@@ ator yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB Fern@@ verkehr &apos;s marketing management board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to their individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often travel by train know that alongside delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are among the biggest off@@ ences .
because often one has , in any case , one of the fellow travellers does not have all the documents that one needs to de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to show is missing .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passenger , which leads to a bad mood in the evenings or large space and delays in controlling their own ticket and the conductor at the end takes the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this applies only to ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other newcom@@ ers on the same track are not yet un@@ locked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on August 9 , 2014 Brit@@ t@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken to its core .
only one day after she arrived in New York City , she sat in St. Louis Gi@@ or@@ ene on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled over a post from someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 year old child , and it is still on the streets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as nobody else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was to twe@@ eter the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ uson , Mo . , live .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body lying on the street and staying there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she stopped her cell phone in order to return later in the evening to T@@ we@@ ets about people on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were photos of the police band and people shou@@ ting , and of a man claiming to be Brow@@ ns father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ uson &apos;s police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman secured his gun and shou@@ ted , &quot; I &apos;ll kill you ... Anim@@ als all . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the type of murder we have gotten used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment , I felt ch@@ ills .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and wept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would ride to F@@ erg@@ uson the next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ uson is the theme of a new documentary , Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinem@@ as from November 11 .
it is a story of survival and protest , of love and loss , of strength and resili@@ ence , which consists of the view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l went to F@@ erg@@ uson with her daughter , who wore a flower @-@ dress and a fitting crown , the two discussed a conversation that they had &quot; over the black experience and the black state countless times before this morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ uson , because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take it away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know it and see it and be raised in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black Constitution , and what we need to do to free ourselves .
even if I am fortunate enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a bl@@ at@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women &apos;s child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel that I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived at F@@ erg@@ uson , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of officers Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for he@@ el shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after 9 August , &quot; she said , and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis Pres@@ i@@ dency of the minority student Nur@@ se Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r just wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one question raised Fer@@ rel@@ l in mind : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often white people - in a community benef@@ iting from their pain and their resili@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ uson did not center their voices and we wanted to make it different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ be@@ cke in@@ mates .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brown &apos;s shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks with us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film .
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ell &apos;s life , as she fell in love with her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ ell &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement who shaped the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media after the killing of the black teen@@ ager , Tra@@ y@@ von Martin , identified themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ zed type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he@@ el was selected as the heart of the film due to their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no accident , although it was at the forefront , because in a life at these jun@@ ctions as a black , gay woman stands so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ uson have long disappeared , but the racial lines between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels bound to this memory since she went to the street three years ago in F@@ erg@@ uson .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we have to love and support each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss about bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though they are not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping mall at the south end of the pedestrian prec@@ inct has been split by supporters and opponents since the first presentation of 2009 .
cold leaves the subject hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while one can say to the bit gallery : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be real great &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t need a person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents are building a gallery more customers move into the city , from which the other businesses benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the plot on which the farmers market hall is located , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
this will end with the beginning of the construction work .
the Gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with the possibility to sit outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sim@@ one Zimmer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many years now , we have been selling almost every week in the farmer &apos;s market hall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the country women always very happy again .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery will settle , depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping palaces in Bit@@ burg ?
whether it &apos;s clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets , I think that &apos;s superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is plenty of that in our city .
you can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a weekly market place , it is even more important that at least the market hall remains intact .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive .
as you can see , shop shops are rented in a shopping mall only by larger companies , because the mi@@ ds there are often not portable for a retail@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; too bad , special deals are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a mall with a market hall fits me not together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market hall look like during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes eventually .
or does the Ges@@ pen@@ st Bit gallery already manage to sell all the shops in Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that simply won &apos;t work .
and there &apos;s no need for a shopping center that &apos;s empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery .
but thanks to the unbeliev@@ ably many - as I can find - there is no room for sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg for a farmer &apos;s market hall .
when the farmers market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a fitting simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing &apos;s DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from che@@ eks @-@ t@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison where the former intelligence analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after having publicly launched diplomatic reports on Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is named A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline sing@@ led out her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans woman and ground@@ breaking dissi@@ dent , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he only had three days in his office .
according to the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which was extracted from Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look like , a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual commentary was created not only in the form of DNA data - the many ways they interpret and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted in 2013 for 20 charges including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
her picture was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , sitting visi@@ bly uncomfortable on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum blonde wig - with whom she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was just hit by the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in this the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette stu@@ b and chew@@ ing gum , extrac@@ ting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people might look .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ alla at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she could not visit at that time and she could not be photographed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her j@@ ailed m@@ use were turned into un@@ equal letters , which in the course of two years exchanged several letters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they even created a comic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the President of Chelsea would transform judgment and she would be able to personally see the exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that Obama really was only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as would be a welcome form of happy coincidence .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump is w@@ aging a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ ez@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the rigid sp@@ li@@ ts he was supposed to fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing concluded with her over@@ sized signature underneath ( the &quot; i &quot; in her sur@@ name is equipped with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation &quot; whose basis sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall is her mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
with the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific lex@@ icon of the artist ) , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ alla had hoped to show how aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .
&quot; what people hope to take with it is that our gen@@ ome is not responsible for who we are and how openly genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic book .
she shows Mann@@ ing how she emerges with a hands @-@ free hands from the discipl@@ in@@ arian tanks of the United States such as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they put down your speech , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who greeted me from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not yet seen the exhibition in person - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it , it will be welcomed in the middle of space by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulations , which gather like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg on the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind her liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee at Oxford University because of murder
a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee at the University of Oxford who are looked for as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued arrest warran@@ ts for their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as evi@@ den@@ ced by the files of the Cook County Local Court .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several bites .
a joint warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the cor@@ pse was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still found dead at the scene of the event , and det@@ ectives examine the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police actively seek the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
since 2007 , La@@ them has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cu@@ b@@ bage , the vice @-@ president of university relations , said in an e @-@ mail explaining that it had now been certified and excluded from entering the Campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal case examined by the relevant authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co @-@ operates in this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cu@@ b@@ gage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville college told in an email that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are prepared to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any way possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also added that War@@ r@@ ens &apos; colleagues were shocked and want him to be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly ur@@ ges the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities will help to find susp@@ ects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip that said that something happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27th .
it was confirmed by security cameras that they were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management team at Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the victim &apos;s tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in co @-@ operation with U@@ KA@@ D ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map has been updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of WA@@ DA &apos;s schedule to comply with the code , which describes the criteria for re@@ establishment of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria listed in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the results of the investigation approved by the WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to publicly subsidi@@ zed dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; referring to the matter , mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programs , and we won &apos;t admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ kos words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , head of the independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with the Russian sales agency r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov made problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , then added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nobody has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was banned in November 2015 by the D@@ oping scandal of the WA@@ DA by conducting dop@@ ing checks in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ KA@@ D ) .
after visiting the Moscow headquarters in July , WA@@ DA Director General Olivier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA &quot; moved in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di does not sell eggs for the time being
these divided the company groups .
it was a mere precau@@ tion , it could not go further from any health impair@@ ment , it was said in the message .
from now on only eggs can only be supplied to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ateral Anti @-@ L@@ utter@@ ing .
Al@@ di wanted to create clarity and transparency with his customers .
the Start @-@ ups that will help your company not to become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - dec@@ ep@@ tive .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity some workers did not mo@@ urn the process .
&quot; there was never any consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
it has called people from outside for help .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at the wa@@ xing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it allows companies to perform surveys , offer specific groups and demographic groups , employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases , whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
in addition to the S@@ nap @-@ P@@ olls and Sur@@ veys from certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low tuned results - so that you can post , why .
companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you are not the next U@@ ber involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment in which those who have spoken were punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ LIN@@ T , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , following the financial technical site Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ all in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
as G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent will send you tailor @-@ made &quot; Pul@@ se &quot; Sur@@ veys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows staff to report bad behavior .
and when the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; public opinion poll@@ s the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent .
if a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences by consumers boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has employed Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
in the past , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now that the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed faster - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience of employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the risk management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es Commit@@ ment in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron scandal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry went online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cent received $ 10 million in funding in February from companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
gli@@ sten@@ ing secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing its total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Sili@@ con Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only stak@@ es .
the staff want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is their votes and that the work they do is worthwhile , they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors gain reputation when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase engagement and deployment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company do not take action .
in fact , if a company asks staff for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the Shift is not fast enough or not at all , it can grow dis@@ appointments and dem@@ oti@@ ate employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask for 4.000 ideas , you must be prepared to have 4,000 talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow , staff will ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ LIN@@ T , so Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organize multiple teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
in Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company will always get new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better retention of employees in an industry that is well @-@ known for high turnover .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers chat on one side of the new training fields of the team on campus .
some with@@ drew their jer@@ sey tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break .
players who are enrolled at the Summer Cour@@ ses will return to their final audi@@ ts after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 p.m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the boys for the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ zin @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday became Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the burden of players , and they have actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 p.m. in order to meet the already fully packed schedule of the players .
the compromise between the two days is more than a day when the Brotherhood moved the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school , for the first time during Mor@@ as , six times in West@@ wood performed practical exercises .
they are supposed to hold 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the start of formal play preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supports the change of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed through , they are moving on , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once we get to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
U@@ C@@ LA will finish its practices as soon as the camp is termin@@ ated , which will be no easy task in view of the clear line of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already cleared a safety net behind a gate post .
bro@@ ker players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then set up to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video tape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ review in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third parties and display their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday said . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in an opinion on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false noti@@ fications and send them to fac@@ tants that may display results of the fact inspection from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe they have also influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential elections .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to be punished after social media networks , if they fail to quickly eliminate hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before elections in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts inspection was started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the knowledge , which stories of fac@@ tual pro@@ verb@@ s are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she added that Facebook still will be testing his feature on the &quot; related article &quot; and works on other changes to his news feed to reduce false news .

but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat in the Ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now a inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cosmop@@ olitan Yor@@ k@@ shire man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says wi@@ st@@ fully . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; covers the time from the Middle Ages through to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story has been illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Herzog ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des that is based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expectedly emotion@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double @-@ agent in the 1700 &quot; s working for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb print !
and letters always smell like smoke , because at that time a fire lit up because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself is there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have a little over@@ valued &quot; ) all this seems too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vic@@ tori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the site and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to landsc@@ aping , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and began to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown as the National Trust received full access until 2006 , when the last hei@@ ress , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees began to look after the archives , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , cards that represent what he had : &quot; you could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting for the two families .
guys , let everything go its way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se themselves in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of an uph@@ eav@@ al that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the uprising started in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; maybe they are joined together ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as The Pri@@ est , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it painter , who hid the Dar@@ rel@@ l family for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the smu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l is presented from the 18th century , who produced his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was dug up ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos; favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the masters seemed to be quite gay , always making debts and spending money on things they could not afford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men ble@@ w their debt crisis by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to recru@@ it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the end of his deployment in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences
he has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sorry to go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf covered
with the opening of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the City of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started their campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team around Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret until Thursday .
at the end of August there will be a feast on the island Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorf chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think this ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote on her website yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are convinced that as a bad Hon@@ ne@@ f citizens , we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; when it comes to action , more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , she is competing with other communities .
the City of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will pay a mid @-@ five @-@ figure amount to its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on reti@@ re@@ es and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so this week too .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff , as before , but in the Prime Minister &apos;s office .
under the head of the government , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Ministers took part in the consultations .
as a result , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the over number .
the government tigh@@ tens the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy have been dismissed .
since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan 16@@ 9 fired the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged ties to the movement of the Ex@@ ile Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as the wi@@ re@@ pul@@ ler of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt will be acting in Ankara for this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the coup attempt as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God &apos;s gift &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely clean up the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
at the end of February , the &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; newspaper published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ ease in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the general staff there are concerns about increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the repe@@ al of the head ban on soldiers , wrote the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in any case , the major involvement of the army and the security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan had a decree firing more than 73@@ 95 heads of state , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were sooner than the actual masters of the country .
three times they appe@@ aled to their role as custo@@ di@@ ans of the secular state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform targets of the European Union .
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is driving forward an Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a particular non @-@ respected officer sought asylum after the coup attempt out of fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a few years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not leave Nato cold .
in any case , after the pur@@ gations , there is doubt that there are doubts about the prepar@@ edness of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management structures and operational skills are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
it envis@@ ages the reduction of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do this by changing the way citizens from other countries will issue green cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ministry wants to rehabili@@ tate circuit for road safety shuttle
again and again over the past few months over the future of the race @-@ race @-@ sh@@ utt@@ les has been fought - now it is to go very fast .
even before the end of the year , the railway line on which the tourist train is going to be built will be built .
in order to secure the long @-@ term future of the race @-@ break@@ er , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work on the track is to begin this year .
&quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g route , the country is committed to this important connection , &quot; declared State Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt .
he estimated the cost of re@@ pairing the track to about 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country sur@@ passes 75 percent .
the contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered also in the future from the country , is currently being fin@@ alized , explained S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the Southern Thurin@@ gia railway as operators are already in agreement on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , vehicles used and quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
as a result , the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle should be ordered regularly in December 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a rail link that is popular especially for tourists between the stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the past few months , a pilot plant has been tested to determine whether the route is used by a large number of people to order them regularly in the future .
the track is also strongly coloured in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
just as you thought it won &apos;t be even more crazy in 2017 , there &apos;s a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a big deal .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and Co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start taking their as@@ cen@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger@@ nail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make fun of it , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey said in the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex dolls have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also &quot; adjust &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot via the shape of the nip@@ ples to the type or color of his finger@@ nails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes even more wor@@ rying as many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would make a st@@ eppe @-@ woman look progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot , for example , allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there &apos;s the Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of timi@@ dity and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says True Compan@@ ion &apos;s website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day , it also has its m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; it can be tired to be fixed on conversation or it can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the allu@@ sions to rape , if one goes one step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , rest@@ less one the most .
on its website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy was compared with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can &apos;t men have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just just another sex toy .
their formation and their increasing refin@@ ement point to something more dense and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core .
most men , of course , will not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R re@@ members their rising popularity they still remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what tran@@ spir@@ es from the marginal zones can be very instruc@@ tive in relation to the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission to do so .
however , there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time where women &apos;s rights are threatened all over the world , in which there is a president in the White House who bo@@ asted women being sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most frigh@@ tening aspect of the TV series &apos; The maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the ent@@ win@@ ed body and the eyes out , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .
the aim behind these sex robots is to establish a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their construc@@ tors want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no communication or background story , nothing that suggests independence or anything that might distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are bo@@ g@@ us slaves .
or to put it in the statement of 2017 : maid service
pumps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of a healthy human mind
it has become a tru@@ ism of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized US voters have also split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving Day there were newspapers with advice on how to deal with the hor@@ r@@ ors of Tr@@ ump @-@ Cho@@ os@@ ing relatives .
we are all trying to make our filter bubbles burst .
less noted is the power of m@@ umps to bring families together .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
it reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House everyone whom she knows , including the republi@@ can relationship with which she had fought for decades for politics , is suddenly and completely strange on the same page .
around the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it is obvious to me that this also involves considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the pro@@ voc@@ ative effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that one day his kit@@ tens will no longer be thrown away . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is , however , an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Republi@@ can norm@@ alizes the right wing , which suddenly appears as a term of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison with its standards .
I find myself now inf@@ ested by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump are indeed a very mild crime .
if Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can only needs to be mentally healthy in order to qualify as im@@ meas@@ urable enhancement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our kids to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the biggest car@@ ous@@ el in the New York Parks Department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are enormous , fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cre@@ at@@ y and the animals twist in order to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the kli@@ m@@ per@@ ing music con@@ veys this in a curious way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to provide a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is in fact not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the Top@@ ic Pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage does not count - but a big round@@ about in the north of London .
the Central Park Car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magic experience , as two two @-@ year @-@ old , 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ twen@@ ties can go on it and have a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it .
on the other hand , during this week I was forced to assess my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need arises .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I was tired of experiencing my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred to hospital with chest pain
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for the second time .
last year , he was hosp@@ ital@@ ised for the treatment of car@@ ving in his w@@ ri@@ sts , according to the prison authorities , after a fall in his cell .
after an appeal of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death @-@ seat .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valentine &apos;s Day in 2013 , taking it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria on her .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed he had his girlfriend for a night@@ time intru@@ der hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us Appe@@ al , of which they say she is too len@@ i@@ ent .
the National Prosecutor &apos;s Office said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ t@@ ank@@ ers from F@@ ier@@ o and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen have been dischar@@ ged into the school holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of the students go to secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , school manager Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te greeted the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 pupils of the four classes , led by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young eagle , who grew up in the chicken farm , but then released to freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the m@@ lower band played a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the chicken farm &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to breed from his chickens .
instead of a chicken @-@ k@@ ens a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of him sm@@ ashed , the eagle started spreading his wings on a high mountain .
after that the classes showed three and four in the studio of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens danced with the young go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinders wore to make the bet .
the Eagle stands for integration , said school director Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te .
the young animal is different from the other kit@@ tens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
she wished each quad@@ rup@@ ed , that he felt accepted in his new school .
there followed thanks to the colleagues , former school@@ master Michael Müller , who repeatedly jumps into teaching pas@@ sports , and the parents &quot; representatives .
the kitchen time is over now , declared class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher .
she only dis@@ miss her students after two years of lessons , because it was a really great time .
finally she was able to rely on the four @-@ door @-@ äss@@ ler .
at the end all students made a song of summer time and holiday time .
at the same time great joy broke out with the children .
eight first @-@ grade students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were arrested for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on television , shared .
on the morning of 1 August , a group of illegal detention people were arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , among them the two Bulgarian people .
on the same day , they were released while an investigation is underway .
the State Department reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated control of the free camping and put on everyone who is found to stay in a place that is not meant for this purpose , considerable fin@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are continued throughout the season .
the Ministry said the court could impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to take part in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they are supposed to improve the emission performance of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and some Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the software updates managed are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to vehicles that have che@@ ating software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the post @-@ retro@@ fitting has ordered the Federal Aviation Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months , but not yet called an exact date .
Daimler advised to appeal to every person affected .
if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done within the scope of the inspection .
how long are the changes to be drawn up altogether ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it depends on the manufacturer &apos;s commitment and political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment up to now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be time @-@ consuming to get an appointment .
what do drivers do that do not drive a car of BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE will advise you to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would reproduce , so S@@ met@@ anin .
does a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars now threaten ?
the ACE is afraid of that .

ll Cool J Rec@@ ei@@ ves Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Award Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the winners does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the scholars .
the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and together with his wife Mel@@ ania will attend the award ceremony .
the prize @-@ winner Le@@ ar , who has become known with progressive TV series , has already announced that he would refrain from participating in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presi@@ dency has decided to neglect the arts and human rights - even the means - and that burdens me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use Tr@@ ump to clarify her point of view .
the Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital .
the former prize winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , is going to reti@@ re next year .
the place is already written - but suitable candidates are rare .
for 31 years , W@@ acker has been a city master builder .
and the work is still a lot of fun to him , as he teaches in the press conference .
he reports of varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it is surprising that no application has yet to fulfil the requirement profile .
the city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the earliest possible date .
in this way - taking into account the regular periods of notice - there is still enough time for a famili@@ arization .
since Has@@ lach is acting as a sub @-@ law office for the Administr@@ ative Community , the applicant must present corresponding agreements .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they were unable to fill them any more , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
but the proximity to the city is important to the city and to it itself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working atmosphere as well as a good mood between the authorities and citizens .
over 30 years in office , a number of significant projects have gathered to look back at the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the construction department and its staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ als and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen Park are about to be initiated .
the Kin@@ zig Bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , and the stadium refur@@ bish@@ ment is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter only will strike some 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all great tasks await my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
in terms of design , there is considerable le@@ e@@ way for a city master builder .
Has@@ la@@ chs &apos;s own yard and gar@@ dener can react to many things flexibly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what fits in , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going urban builder emphas@@ ises .
anyway , the architect has a high level of responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is the client , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been there for 15 years .
also that his successor remains for a long time , W@@ acker wants : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place . &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate but also for the further design of the city .
if you want to be able to inher@@ it Roland W@@ acker , you should be able to instruc@@ t the city of Has@@ lach as a graduate engineer or a b@@ achel@@ or &apos;s degree in architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and construction planning .
the municipal construction department is subject to high and civil engineering , construction planning , under@@ mining opportunities , administration of urban properties , urban depot with building yard and urban gar@@ den@@ ers as well as the Lower Building Law Department , including monuments conservation .
bicycles tos@@ sed on leads : closed on the south track
according to the police , the previously unknown cul@@ pr@@ its had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track crossing in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) onto the leader@@ ships .
these were so severely damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night .
close to the scene there were witnessed by a sho@@ oter and a bicycle driver by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesman Christoph Pos@@ ch to AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpet@@ rator would have brought himself into great danger and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed traction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay in delay and the costs for rail @-@ moving traffic , there may also be a number of sponsors of the railway customers to the perpetrators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum was to be assumed , the speaker said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages had been repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the south @-@ rail track could be guided without obstruc@@ tions .
nearly ten people had fallen off on Friday morning , two of them entered the correspondence .
freight trains did not fall out , but they were delayed .
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokesman Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate may sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study says exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases .
the incur@@ able condition affecting around 1.3 million in the US and in the UK 300@@ ,000 causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intest@@ ine .
the leading researcher , Dr Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes , which hide in the food , do not penetrate the body .
cells that are able to cause inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue .
if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments it was found that a type of tolerance promoting immune cells occurs in mice carrying a specific bacter@@ ium in their bow@@ els .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an on tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han diet tolerant diet tolerant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mili@@ eus promotes , if the same system also applies to humans .
the post@@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan resear@@ ched a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which , however , had not had this .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species were found that were present in mice with the immune cells , but were missing in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lack@@ ed an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they were created by the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system , the researchers sent L. reu@@ ter@@ i into a liquid and then passed small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on im@@ mature immune cells isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was cleaned from the liquid , it turned out to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , which is known as an In@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the mice &apos;s feed , the number of cells increased by approximately 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han levels were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same tolerant cells as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han levels in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; to N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Manchester United signed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup ki@@ cked off against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed the holder roll as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
however , matic was excluded from the pre @-@ delivery Asia tour of the blues and only managed 45 minutes to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , that he had to improve before the opening of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
alongside M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u started in the Avi@@ va Stadium when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted another three new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to meet three of his four primary new obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great pains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew away from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US state Mich@@ igan and moved into the form of a Dream@@ liner via the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be on the radar screens .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertisement earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new set@@ back for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
how the wind turns : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD leader , S &amp; D prime ministers always looked for Berlin with a certain concern before elections .
only a fire from the central party , but no head@@ wind from the Con@@ federation , was the most important wish of the election fighters .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the staff members from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus have been observing the events in the provincial capitals of the SPD ( SPD ) .
what Schulz has gotten from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach by head@@ winds .
there were deep set@@ backs .
one after another .
the federal CD@@ U looks after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony as a general signal against the coalition of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green can simply not rule out reliably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprise fraction of a Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the election of the Land@@ tag , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Federal Executive Director Michael Kell@@ ner has called on the back@@ sliding Lower Saxony Green Party member El@@ ke T@@ ests to return their mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear for@@ gery of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ ests must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal Executive Director and Leader of the Green Party ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD election campaig@@ ner si@@ gh , when Friday morning the new job message reaches the party headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is facing the CD@@ U without its own government majority following the resignation of the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ ests .
it is the provisional climax of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the misery began with the un@@ expectedly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , not more , the comrades were re@@ ass@@ uring at that time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
then it became - and indeed everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel put the SPD in exchange , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te was sli@@ pping the party smoothly .
in the weeks after , comrades , the comrades were again lab@@ ori@@ ously ra@@ ging .
then , when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit from Hamburg came .
and with him came the next deep @-@ blow .
mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD member of the SPD , lost his nim@@ bus that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned .
and because in crisis communication he did everything wrong with what you can do wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival .
so now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW Ex@@ hau@@ st and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister has long been critic@@ ised .
slight changes in demand were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , Wei@@ l has always tried to establish accents in the Con@@ federation over the past few weeks .
the ambi@@ tions of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin also did not remain hidden in the context of Martin Schulz .
they let him grant , because they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect , Wei@@ l does not blame the party internal constra@@ int of the Lower Saxon Gre@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and Schulz is not at all .
for the time being , comrades , therefore , try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and especially to the back@@ sliding Par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ West .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is intol@@ erable and democratic how Mrs. T@@ v@@ est puts her own career income on the interests of all the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frau T@@ westen couldn &apos;t be elected as a direct candidate because of their person , but by the Land List of the Lower Saxony Green Party , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Lower Saxon de@@ pu@@ ties continued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compla@@ ins of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters over four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l a prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the leading candidate in the election of the Bundestag , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U member fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for the background to be clari@@ fied .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments to the CD@@ U of Lower Saxony .
funding money for town core III
those who want to rehabili@@ tate their own house in the years can get support from the country soon .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of the jet@@ ty of town development announced on Wednesday in a sensation .
at the beginning of the information session , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a look back on what happened so far .
since 1991 , there have been some san@@ itation areas .
at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two @-@ thirds of the funding amount .
in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , previous refur@@ bish@@ ments are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; successful project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to encourage the development of the interior and not only to open up new construction areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4 , the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III .
the funding amount amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500 000 euros would come from the country , the rest of the community &apos;s feelings .
how does a re@@ development area arise ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one would , as Sch@@ ind@@ ler further , investigate , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether in the planned area there is any interest in san@@ iti@@ sing .
if necessary , the territorial borders may also shift again .
the bridge was on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be objective @-@ related , i.e. per plot .
the restructuring area would then finally be set as a stat@@ ute .
the grants period for the subsidies has been running since January 1 , 2017 until April 30 , 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , the stock@@ taking will only take place once , in the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area receive a questionnaire to fill out the questionnaire .
in November or December , it should take place as soon as possible , so that the renovation can begin next year .
after that , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that each commun@@ e had to carry out the said preventive examinations .
the aim is to evaluate and decide when it will be san@@ iti@@ sed and to what extent .
for the respective property there will be also a mem@@ orand@@ um of re@@ payment in the land register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come to himself once more , and make a picture of the situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she promised . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that the project was a key success factor for the project .
therefore , there will be questionna@@ ires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Building and Property sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which there is , among other things , the structural condition and the refur@@ bish@@ ment views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hou@@ se@@ - and H@@ ousing Rain@@ bow &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data on size , distribution and residents of a residential area can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Work@@ sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is important to note that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible for funding .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler also stressed that the distribution of funds according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; - whoever comes first , first advises .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subsidies for later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the audience a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; renovation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor sets itself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his door@@ step , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between the thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has partner@@ ed with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ aes@@ thesia in the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , everything for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now installed both at home and in his BMW Z@@ 4 technology which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost tax@@ pa@@ yers thousands
the White House decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American manufacturing in the last month costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military provided to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice @-@ President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
in addition to a yacht made of Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ man made of Wis@@ con@@ sin and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the helicopter produced in Connec@@ ti@@ cut was exhibited .
the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or cargo , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it , because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event , the deputy commander of the Nav@@ al Aviation Committee .
the news showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event , and so long stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on that evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , a second crew is required for the return flight due to restric@@ ting service hours .
the original flight crew was during the event with the helicopter while the security personnel of the unit remained on the plane during the time on the plane .
from the recordings provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could viol@@ ate destiny .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the command@@ ant wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you &apos;re locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an impetus to reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to claim their use only for a photo op is unusual .
Tr@@ ump performed an investigation in February when the presidential plane was in front of the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages compla@@ ining about the use of the presidential aer@@ op@@ lane by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 crew often carry training flights in the area around Washington and the South La@@ wn to dep@@ ose US President in the White House with precise centimet@@ res .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 conducted 58 training courses in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
helicop@@ ters also flew 11 hours this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers took over the burden of none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokesman for S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in ex@@ porting the helicopter to the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget labels for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the ho@@ ur@@ ly rate of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for refund rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wal@@ ters said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a 2015 RA@@ ND study , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .
at that time , the former spokesman of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present things that are produced in America this week , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud to contribute to our national security and I expect hundreds if not thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
of course it is appropriate to emphasize that . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine .
in the White House Tr@@ ump said to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tricky job
runner @-@ up of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga ki@@ cks off at the Tab@@ ular @-@ third Su@@ chs@@ dorf S@@ V .
the TC blue @-@ white Ne@@ uss performs tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the table third Su@@ chs@@ dorf S@@ V .
despite five bat@@ ches of still flaw@@ less balance , the leader of the Second Tennis League has gained the sense of reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay in any case has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially at the rear positions I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorf S@@ V , imports from the high North are mainly concerned .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to deplo@@ y@@ ments in the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay , looking at Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören und Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ ska ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be hard for us as always . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good dose of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser crew for the trip to the high north is convenient .
Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier could give his debut for blue @-@ white .
if the Fren@@ chman , currently active in the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian bi@@ ella active Fren@@ chman , does not succeed in the Bundes@@ liga , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) playing at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec will be his first deployment in this season .
the previously un@@ defeated Chi@@ ene Hans Pod@@ les@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo was yesterday with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski still at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el at the ball .
but he should be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , also Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could re @-@ enter the team .
if it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was the number one of the junior world rank@@ ings in January 2016 , someone from the trainer at Mari@@ us Z@@ ay fills the cad@@ re .
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump was not really happy when he put his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to tigh@@ ten sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress Pack@@ ed a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming the US advance .
after all , the plan is to punish European companies that help Russians build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU .
since then , investors of the local O@@ MV , who co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Eastern Province North Stream 2 together with other European companies .
the dr@@ one scene is enormous .
however , it is too early to estimate the consequences , thus the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life even by an executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has seen which the Group could fend off and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the cal@@ i Cart@@ el is put at the center of attention in the series of Net@@ fli@@ x series
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer reveals , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x hasn &apos;t been over for a long time .
the three and four seasons have already been confirmed by the streaming service , the first one received their first trailer and showed the latest gu@@ sts of the show .
with the third season , the DE@@ A has directed its attention to the rich@@ est organization of drug trafficking in the world : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kar@@ tell .
led by four powerful sponsors , they &quot; operate like a Fort@@ une 500 Company &quot; with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ az@@ ar ) is the leader of the car@@ tel , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) warran@@ ts the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .
in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as Ja@@ vier Pe@@ ña , the type that invites American and Colum@@ bian prosec@@ uting authorities to support the war against drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Sil@@ vest@@ re , Kerry C@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ cos will begin on September 1st .
roll back : the city introduces 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table itself .
with firm contact persons for the children and a delegation to the team .
in the city &apos;s day care centers , the clock is turned back .
on September 1st the city of Kre@@ feld takes over food supply in the city &apos;s day@@ care centres ( Kit@@ as ) again in self @-@ control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooking is still out of the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh water cooled .
the city operates in the Kre@@ feld area 46 day@@ care centers , in 44 children get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
in the past kit@@ ing year 2,@@ 800 children sat at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , not only children who are cared for 45 days of the week are eating in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ita &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children stay until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 partial @-@ time employees have kitchen service from 1 September : they heat the meals supplied , supplement them with salad , raw food and fruit , portions the meal individually , give away the meal , clean out , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are assigned to a ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two group@@ ed as well as seven @-@ group equipment - determines the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen staff are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because it is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare the food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known power in the ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
cleaning the K@@ ita @-@ premises - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen power , also the charm that it has challenged in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign distribution for the city as the most economical one , it reads from the press office .
and that , although 46 partial @-@ time forces are newly hired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so much in weight for about 750 people in the area of education , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the Chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , Official Director of the Mission of the United Nations , said that hundreds of women will be elected in the provinces in the provinces . three women are candidates for the role of the vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement .
elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the election process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will take place on April 5 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Taliban have issued threats against a election process which coinci@@ des with the transition of international combat actions to an advisory role .
this year the elections will be handed over to the next elections for the first time peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ som , a strong role for women will further strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an independent Ele@@ ction Commission reports that 1.2 million women of a total registered 3.6 million voters are registered .

two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to ro@@ b a 13 year old girl .
according to the police information , the men talked to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old , who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , at 2.@@ 55 p.m , because they wanted to make calls with the girl &apos;s mobile phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused , but went on with her friends .
as a result , one of the offen@@ ders tried to attack the mobile phone and the girl &apos;s necklace , which , however , failed .
the duo fled without prey .
the two young men could later be arrested by the police .
the investigation is underway .
G@@ MB ap@@ pre@@ hen@@ sion on investments at Mc@@ Vi@@ dar@@ s factory in Glasgow
a union wants to ensure the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow at managers of Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ ast .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company kept silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which , in addition to other products , produces hob@@ no@@ bs and pure tea cookies .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than £ 5 million in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the head of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s urged to &quot; express concerns that financing for moderni@@ zation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organ@@ izer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; the fact that we can &apos;t gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross affects our members deeply .
generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrate heavily on the local community and the Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social dis@@ advant@@ aged .
thus , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the Eastern end of Glasgow is in urgent need of a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond right to it as we value the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly .
we discussed with the employees that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than £ 5 million in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility . if our operations change at the location , employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warned of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga may show its interest to Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main won &apos;t leave N@@ ey@@ mar after she has given an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger his release clause , but did she warn Barcelona three years before the world record attack ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record more than twice the previous mark , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United in the last season for $ 89 million .
after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is mad about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans board insi@@ sts that the club has always done his best to take care of him since his arrival in San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago from the PS@@ G president ?
when Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club who wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players with them , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , where the Spanish association expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that it would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price deals for N@@ ey@@ mar .

on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um with his VW came from Stol@@ zen@@ au on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese .
in the area of the b@@ ypass of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him in his driving lane , so that he had to move to the right .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is what author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann says .
the final report on the mis@@ use scandal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussion .
Christian Wei@@ ss@@ ler , speaker of the reform movement &quot; Wir sind Kirche , &quot; declared after publication in relation to the German press agency , he expected from the former Regensburg Bishop and current Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology .
it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then incorrect evaluation of the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand critici@@ zed that in reporting about violence in the dom@@ es of dom@@ es with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double standards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in regard to the ass@@ aults in Regensburg no one doub@@ ted that it would be &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; but the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , Histori@@ an and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Thur@@ n and Ta@@ xis also said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one would like to go to the church and it &apos;s a dev@@ oured fres@@ her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blows were a normal pedago@@ gical means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would be unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on the mis@@ use cases , Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann writes , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger the &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ass@@ esses the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the B@@ ish@@ um Regensburg to the En@@ ligh@@ tenment At@@ tor@@ ney Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were subjected to sexual abuse between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s with high plau@@ sibility .
in the final report Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 , says : &quot; in summary , it can be said that many cases of physical and psychological violence have been used by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
especially in the case of high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also be more intense .
nevertheless , contrary to numerous other alle@@ gations , many victims have appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even bring positive memories to him despite violence . &quot;
in the interview , H@@ esh@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use scandal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger seems to be reli@@ eved .
Mr. H@@ esh@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; In@@ ci@@ dents of the Ex@@ erc@@ ise of Protection of Viol@@ ence at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a conflic@@ ting picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one , many students emphas@@ ise his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , it appears as ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became handy when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz brought no top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long story from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is common in it .
he is particularly devoted to eight pages and he is clearly spoken of every suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school also took place outside its sphere of influence .
at best it is possible to repro@@ ach him , to experience it too late or to have taken first hints seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on which he worked , was felt by virtually all the respon@@ dents as - literally - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also provides an excellent certificate , described him as &quot; warm @-@ hearted , &quot; &quot; skilled &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , biscuits and candy , and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which also led to rage erup@@ tions .
the fact that he did not only s@@ no@@ o@@ ze with chairs and threw the mu@@ d@@ lock on the floor , but he also distributed ear@@ then ears and too che@@ ek@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he himself admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widely used in the question@@ able period , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents and teachers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you know such methods of breeding ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I have also experienced this in a secular school , a state school .
compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the violent exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , they are of course bag@@ at@@ ellen .
one wonders whether it is not to do with his famili@@ arity and role as the brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just r@@ ushed to him .
many people who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently on the Bavarian Pope .
but the truth is : the report rati@@ fies Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , a lot has been reported in connection with the report on the subject of abuse of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also involved in any involvement or involvement with regard to sexual abuse in the final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claimed to have entrusted themselves to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the afflicted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse was , however , that most victims remain silent .
if they did not even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir director , who would have been a colleague of the cul@@ pr@@ its in a professional manner .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen pup@@ il rate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role with regard to the mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student formulated it like this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely evidence and could have stopped the respective perpet@@ rator .
I consider it ... even to be really absurd to assume that it was to him ... Bu@@ bs more intru@@ sive or clearer or more opened than towards their parents , intern@@ s , tru@@ sts of trust , etc .
that one talks to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report concludes with a clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their surroundings affected him in advance could not be confirmed as part of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free to speak of any co @-@ existence .
he cannot be accused of preventing or displaying him .
therefore there is no reason to associate a good name with these re@@ fut@@ able crimes , as happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the media to read in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything was mixed up in the reporting and mixed into a huge orange mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses and somewhere , right in the middle , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is in turn a mis@@ use of the report .
because it is separated clean@@ ly : between the pre @-@ school and the high @-@ school of the dom@@ es , between sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses and , let &apos;s say , other alle@@ gations .
in addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , so also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the chor@@ us of the Cathedral Spar@@ rows .
the whole terrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were literally har@@ ass@@ led and mal@@ treated , and suffered from them , all happened at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to prevail .
but with those whom Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only to face when they were already at the cathedral @-@ cat @-@ school @-@ nasi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on this , like most of the witnesses , the theme of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; primary school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was tab@@ oo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what else was different at the cathedral @-@ cat @-@ school ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore in numerous cases even unite positive memories with him in numerous cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at most , the repro@@ ach still remains to have looked away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he just started to establish himself and from the events at a school in which he did not work and was responsible , ( thus the witness ) wanted to hear nothing , and then again around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently shut the ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the high school gym@@ nasi@@ um , which the report was even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the prepar@@ atory school there will continue to be the punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the face of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed when Prü@@ fer &apos;s pen@@ alties were banned in Bavaria too .
before that they took place in a legal grey @-@ zone , as each of us knows well .
it was difficult for him to estimate , where the suffer@@ ers might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
this is simply not true .
it was only in 1980 that the capital punishment of schools was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Thur@@ n and Ta@@ xis insi@@ sts that it is unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards to the time at that time .
how do you see it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; historians are talking about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sn@@ are of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. the risk of assessing the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess is right .
but this of course does not apply to sexual abuse , which has been ab@@ hor@@ rent at all times , and not for what has been banned in the pres@@ ch@@ ool of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , which goes far beyond that at that time .
this is all very horrible and I am glad that it will finally work .
but at the same time I have to take protection from Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipline and punishment , that is to say earrings and ears and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when corpor@@ al punishment was then banned , he kept strictly adher@@ ing to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of his Regensburg time did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger play in talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject of the trial judge also speak in the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI tells from his perspective that the Cathedral Spar@@ rows played only a minor role .
nevertheless , I do not at all show that he led a strict regi@@ ment there .
but even this must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand of unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g from the hitherto nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , the true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with biscuits and candy alone , one does not make a big singer out of un@@ ru@@ ly boys and every success , whatever the area , but always discipline , passion and overcoming .
what kind of people have you experienced as Georg R@@ atz@@ inger at the conversations with her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I have met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful , humor@@ ous , gro@@ unded , deep @-@ believing and hear@@ ti@@ ly @-@ hearted people , of whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could only do something for a fly .
I regularly get contact with him , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen today , 23 years after his retirement , regularly visit him , read it , read it - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family .
those who did not forgive him until today that he was strictly speaking to them are clearly in the minority .
most of the dom@@ es are thank@@ ful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music .
and that he is always a good , fa@@ ther@@ ly teacher - a strict father , of course , that may be - but also a lovely resp@@ ectable person , to which they still look up today and which they almost rever@@ e .
and please , again clearly : everything you acc@@ use to him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time .
we can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago .
but it is highly unfair to make a man just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make a media sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
the evil intent that is behind it is all too obvious .
for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him .
now he would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany would probably know no one of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
