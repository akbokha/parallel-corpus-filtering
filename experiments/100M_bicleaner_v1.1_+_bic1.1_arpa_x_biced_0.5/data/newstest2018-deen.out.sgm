<seg id="1">Munich, 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An asylum institution, where young people are supposed to meet.</seg>
<seg id="3">A pit chapel, where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Farmers cultivate the former cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card coin boosts exciting stories.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everyone who had to get upset because the Navi was showing a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historic maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bavarian State Government, are anything but up-to-date - but precisely therefore very enlightening.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how towns and communities have changed in the area of circulation of Munich's Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a patchwork that is not immediately recognizable as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">For towns and municipalities, detailed maps, so-called elemental sheets, have been incorporated into the large overview map.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian Association of Surveying between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic record of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801: it was the present-day neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern card.</seg>
<seg id="18">Elector Max IV. Joseph continued the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau," and thus the Bavarian surveying management.</seg>
<seg id="19">The information leaflet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is to be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek (Bavarian State Library).</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. in 1877, as a Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling lies in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where the Westpark is today, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-written numbered flute pieces from the so-called "Ursus" from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small parcels show no farmers there today - but gardeners of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the October test, was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other hand of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "" "on the Gasteig" "" "or from the hill" "" "On the air" "" "- but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich district Irrenanstalt" "" "On the Auer Lüften" "" "was created." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the establishment - that psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended with the chains of so-called" "" "Irish" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">He also prohibited the personnel from using violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum of Haidhausen, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">There was room for 280 patients, later it was extended to 500 seats.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisepower plant in Haar in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-Amper-Klinikum in Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been located there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in the Munich Salesianum meet in the area of the former Auer Badan.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the Children's House "Casa Don Bosco" was erected - architecturally based on the original construction of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "Main Square" "" "around 1856, the Kaufinger Street was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allied bombs broke many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a chapel chapel dating back to the Middle Ages, once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn commuter route takes place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the promotion of coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which will enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls for Afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when travelling through the state, as a number of dubious, racial-based incidents occur throughout the state and are noted here," "" "said the Group's opinion." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">A recent law of Missouri, which makes people more difficult to accuse discrimination, as well as the prosecuting authorities of the state, which are disproportionately aimed at minorities, prompted the group to issue travel warnings, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed, "said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in dignified circumstances at the beginning of the year, after having no fuel at all during the voyage and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "the Council also points to a recent report by Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black motorists in the state will be 75 percent more common than whites." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be willing to bring in deposit money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI report program, which classifies the state with regard to the number of injuries to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult to accuse a company because of housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the States adopted immigration laws that bind local law enforcement agencies to arrest people because of immigration violations, which will contribute to further race profile in view of ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently, interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischbacher Weidewatering project is a successful project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU members of Parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac gave a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the right-hand courtyard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the fishing company CDU met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first provided insights into his farm, where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 milk cows and as many young kittens and accommodates in five apartments holiday-branches.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "black-white milk" "" "is the alternative marketing path for him for the milk of his cows," "" "Schwendemann" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaeste comes exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "as he is also chairman of Fischerbach, he described the electric fence as" "" "essential" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot profitably manage on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area care for a lot of work, much needs to be done with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parent company and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even though he did not conduct bio-operations.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "" "the Commune recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about the" "" "Leader" "" "promotion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the afforestation of the land could be extended for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have are those people who work in agriculture and think about how they can continue their operation," "" "the mayor emphasised." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often criticised for funding</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots were fenced in 2013 by eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open-up area thus amounts to 40 hectares, which may not be forested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">From the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was promoted over leaders, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmer stayed 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 km of pasture-fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and rural women."</seg>
<seg id="90">Peter Weiss was also convinced: "here, the best foods are produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Conservation Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state-run promotion of pasture-fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the area to be fenced must not be smuggable (inclination above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">The application of eight participants with 24 pitches, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence, is currently running for the Fisherbach Weidezauncing Project 2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open-up area is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred anymore?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firenze Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN on the President's suggestions for the drastic limitation of legal migration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty Imitators would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he attacked its meaning, and especially the significance attributed to it, when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta complained: "I don't want to enter a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem you refer to is added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's stirring words, the only ones in which a state not only invites the old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weeds, your poor, and your afflicted masses longing to breathe freely, and the miserable waste of your rich shores."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable waste" "" "was better seen on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict about the significance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who used to place their words on the basis of their death at the base - knew well that they performed a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicism by presenting the feminine embodiment of freedom in a worn classic image.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of Exilantes.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from right wing wanted to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty won't invite anyone, but rather an early Neoconservatives who bring the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not enlighten the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">Lazarus's great imaginative action was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, miserable, but desperate people after long and often horrible journeys on the deck of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not light the way, but light the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butflip - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain by the team.</seg>

<seg id="149">Doyle recalls her first world championships, when the only other Scotsman was in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that they are "hugely proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots belong not only to the team, but in some cases they will also be involved in medals and finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammates had voted for me and chosen me, makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team." ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It just shows how far we have come.</seg>

<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only indicated that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from being back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>

<seg id="160">Block Critics via Facebook: do not concern yourself with a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad news.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers hit him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He knocked at the criticism, sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783 Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland, Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him of it at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Governor's staff dismissed the complaint as a frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary type of heat.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to debutt his hair-less head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Hence the blocking of individuals who come to the Governor's side is a public forum that is considered officially and by employees paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the Governor's actions and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post said with some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profound.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor recited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I commented courteously that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other news," "" "she wrote in the commentary section of the news release" "" "The Post" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I also do not appreciate this idea, if a number of people take a position on the same subject, they are rather disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the staff of the Governor described as a" "" "concentrated spam attack" "" "would probably call others" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "" "" "it is much cleaner than in former times when people have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles or to arrest demonstrators and silence them." ""</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>

<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also visited ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable port had a similar effect as the internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous scribes suggested to his leadership.</seg>

<seg id="409">The survey of more than 1,000 persons, conducted by a Jet Charter Service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also noted that younger travellers would rather disregard the rules.</seg>
<seg id="410">The respondents admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something that was forbidden by the TSA, were 19.7 percent millennials, compared with less than 15 percent, members of Generation X.</seg>
<seg id="411">The most common items that were deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.</seg>

<seg id="421">Electric-Tausendsassa Elon Musk likes to deal with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3."</seg>
<seg id="422">In doing so, he has failed so far that a part of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.</seg>
<seg id="423">In addition to the ever triumphant figures for sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla leader Elon Musk has revealed another less impressive number for the first time in the announcement of the latest quarterly balance: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">In recent months, Musk frequently had more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery just begins.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now, Musk admits: of the 518,000 pre-orders, 63.000 have already been withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are merely non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of a cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 Euros (in the US $1000 and in the UK 1,000 pounds) "Reservation payment."</seg>
<seg id="428">At the present 45,000 of such non-binding reservations, Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to now about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">Its argument: the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not in demand but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla supplied 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">In 2018, all models are to be merged - 500,000, by 2020 one million.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, 1800 bookings are available per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Whoever orders a "Model 3" today must expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive his brand-new production lines never tested in practice without any major interruptions with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>
<seg id="437">However, if there are greater delays, then the non-binding nature of the reservations may become a problem for Tesla.</seg>

<seg id="440">One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, took back his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce the emissions of smog-induced air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the change when his agency turned out to be more responsive to the needs of government authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint lodged against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">"" "" "" "there is a deadline agreed on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 Ozone standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="444">Pruitt announced in June that he would delay observing a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering with local decisions or hindering economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was before his appointment by President Donald Trump's Prosecutor of Oklahoma, was a reliable opponent of tougher environmental protection for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly resorted to blocking or delaying regulation, which resists the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Judge Court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration, which required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.</seg>
<seg id="449">In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his reversal of ozone standards quite simply reinforces the willingness of the EPA to co-operate with the States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"" "" "" "under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be indicted by activists and others, and set the date for implementation in an agreement," "" "said Pruitt, who accused EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job."

<seg id="451">"" "" "" "we do not believe in regulation by legal proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously." ""</seg>
<seg id="452">"" "we also take the law and the authority we give to us seriously." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="453">"" "nevertheless, the EPA statement said that Pruitt will eventually use his" "" "authority to delay and all other legally available powers" "" "to ensure that the rules are based on a sound policy and the best available information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress push for a more comprehensive new version of the ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">A draft bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.</seg>
<seg id="456">The measure was not yet made in the Senate.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumble celebrates 750 Years of St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, a serenade is invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July, at 4: 30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors of Tumlingens a concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergischer Ursel register: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei by master Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the text of the document, on the hill of Tumour, apart from the former parish church, there was also a magnificent court, where the church or patronage belonged, and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">There were also people living there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt from 1858, it was beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the city image of Tumlingen, the "mountain" of the third, the magnificent settlers of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the period around the year 1600 confirm these historical facts.</seg>
<seg id="476">The patronage law arose from the early medieval self-church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Connected with this was the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two was shattered on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over in 1942 during the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were cut and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tumour Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from radio welding.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the church of Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the steeple was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Eve 1834 a storm split the steeple and half fell.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the present tower of Turmzwerg was preserved as a witness of the 750 years of the old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Veil are cultivating the Hilarius facility by the "Schaffy Pensioners" as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">As organizers, the friends and sponsors of Tumlingens invite the old cemetery to St. Hilariuskapelle on Sunday, July 16th, to the sixth serenade.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the Combo of Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with words by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Hartmut Romann refers to the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4: 30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3: 30 PM.</seg>
<seg id="499">For the closing of the serenade, a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," "" "the organisers give out the fantastic view." ""</seg>
<seg id="501">The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is of importance for tumulls and hearers.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and sponsors of Tumlingens feel particularly committed to home care, such as Serenade-organiser Walter Martini.</seg>

<seg id="507">It is unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved at all, as at the time in Viersen, only at the town border to Schwalmtal there was a wind power concentration zone.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are fundamentally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">"" "such zones should prevent a" "" "paramount" "" "of the landscape." ""</seg>
<seg id="511">A few days before, the city of Viersen had decided to change the area of land into a second wind-force concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette - but the district government of Düsseldorf did not approve it because of a fault.</seg>
<seg id="512">"" "" "" "due to the lack of planning law, the granted approval decision is still illegal and therefore also to be withdrawn," "" "said Christoph Erkens, President of" "" "Boisheim resists." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="517">The circle makes it the occasion to examine the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">However, they do not expect the procedure to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="519">With regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the argumentation of the association "Boisheim resists."</seg>
<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheim Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the city Viersen participates indirectly, closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare site.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the establishment of the four wind turbines, the electricity demand of around 11 400 households is to be met - that is roughly one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four-bay households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re plans to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind farm in Übach-Palenberg in the district Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="533">The trade association and the municipal authorities want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract residents to shopping in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="534">As the chairman of the business association, Christian König, announced, the "home-shopping" weekend aims to sensitize customers about what offers their own city offers away from the usual supermarket commodity.</seg>
<seg id="535">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="536">In addition, domestic firms should present themselves with their training places.</seg>

<seg id="540">The city administration and commercial association co-operate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</seg>
<seg id="541">In this way, the trade association and the city go into another stage of the project "Attractive Center."</seg>
<seg id="542">This includes new offerings, such as the first "active day" to the well festival, with sales open on Sunday, talks with all professionals and hosts, in order to move them to active participation.</seg>
<seg id="543">Also attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees this day are part of the concept.</seg>
<seg id="544">In addition, customer potential is to be reopened or reopened.</seg>
<seg id="545">This includes spa guests and tourists.</seg>
<seg id="546">But also many locals lost sight of the city centre when shopping.</seg>
<seg id="547">In the end, everyone would have to contribute to liven the city centre - to landlords, all the city's businesses and clubs.</seg>
<seg id="548">It was necessary to overcome the lethargy with a network, which had been partly widened, and had said in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="549">Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, announced that the nationwide third "home shopping" day, five Thüringer cities, will take part in the first time.</seg>

<seg id="681">Max quantity working as a volunteer</seg>
<seg id="682">They work in several places in their volunteer year.</seg>
<seg id="683">Where anywhere?</seg>
<seg id="684">Quantity: normally in Steinfurt, in the furniture fair, once a week I help in Greven in the furniture bridge.</seg>
<seg id="685">And I also worked at school in the open whole day.</seg>
<seg id="686">What are your experiences with it?</seg>
<seg id="687">Quantity: it is a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.</seg>
<seg id="688">I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.</seg>
<seg id="689">They are now 26 years, thus a late professional volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="690">How does that come about?</seg>
<seg id="691">A lot: I did a high school.</seg>
<seg id="692">And then a civil engineering study, let's say, successfully aborted.</seg>
<seg id="693">I realized for myself that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something different with people working.</seg>
<seg id="694">And then I asked myself what are you doing.</seg>
<seg id="695">Do a social year, there is an insight where you can see how it is, in the focal point, maybe also, really.</seg>
<seg id="696">And was it like that?</seg>
<seg id="697">Lot: I collected great impressions.</seg>
<seg id="698">I will start my studies in social welfare in the winter semester.</seg>
<seg id="699">I'm going to study the dual, probably in the Jugendamt Herne, I'm studying a social worker and studying in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.</seg>
<seg id="700">Is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service?</seg>
<seg id="701">Quantity: yes, it is very variable.</seg>
<seg id="702">It always depends where you are doing your FSJ.</seg>
<seg id="703">It is possible to do it from retirement home to youth work - in all aspects of social work.</seg>
<seg id="704">With me it was very varied.</seg>
<seg id="705">I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.</seg>
<seg id="706">For me it was just the right thing that matured me.</seg>
<seg id="707">I could see my own strengths and see how it really works.</seg>
<seg id="708">Different from civil engineering studies?</seg>
<seg id="709">A lot: well, it's not about calculating Statiks here.</seg>
<seg id="710">There are always other people who have a completely different story behind them.</seg>
<seg id="711">Whether a refugee, be it a teenager, who has been brought out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually.</seg>
<seg id="712">Very interesting.</seg>
<seg id="713">And you didn't have reservations?</seg>
<seg id="714">Quantity: I'm not the guy for that.</seg>
<seg id="715">It is an area that gives a lot.</seg>
<seg id="716">A lot of love, a lot of kindness.</seg>
<seg id="717">There are also negative moments, but that's the way life is.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the finance rules of football on Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded expenditure on European football associations will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come from the UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain, as the guiding organization who oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious champions league tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play Regulations that were launched in 2011 by the UEFA mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer from Neymar was financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilians out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of ten million dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can make money easy for Neymar to sign up and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, in view of the financing of the team by the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but have to deal with legitimate income sources that allow them to break even the break-even point in their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs which had taken enormous debts in their quest for success effectively cheated and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP declined from concentrating on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, which Roman Abramovich used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP investment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses amounting to 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen in favour of the presidency in 2015, its successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to discourage excessive expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "surely FFP is not dead and we will surely reinforce the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at the UEFA, compared to The Associated Press in the past week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the Buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">"" "" "" "Neymar signed a five-year contract, so that the sum total of €44.4 million can be accounted for in the financial statements for the next five years." ""</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 brought the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros ($82 million at that time), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a catastrophic company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market sets, UEFA would not allow this to be considered a legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments of the organizing committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar WM will be ambassador and such a manoeuvre for UEFA regulators could easily be figured out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to ignore any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, announcing on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They talked about the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than €10 million with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">Accounts for the last fiscal year have to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects that Neymars arrival is a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and tricot sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after signature.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly labeled to see one of the best football players, and tried to prevent Neymars move by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the president of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar's last ownership stake in PSG." ""</seg>

<seg id="1183">Nostalgia goes to "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the niche</seg>
<seg id="1184">This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80's, for the 90-year-grunge era (as the pioneer David Wain and Michael Showalter the Sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for himself - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd were going to bigger things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as a franchise it feels like time is running out.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"" "" "" "first Day of Camp" "" "worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humors (it contained an original story for a speaking can of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin)." ""</seg>

<seg id="1189">Ten Years Later, with his adults, who now play adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the watering pattern principle, including a riff on Stalker's films of the 90's like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("Die Hand That Keeps the Cradle").</seg>
<seg id="1190">At one point, a character runs through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The amiable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there's another crazy evil plot involved in Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-done impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>

<seg id="1197">It's the moments of random insanity that could heat up this franchise as a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until he achieves what I see as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the band premiere of Wet Hot American Summer.</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia: the revival of Cold War by "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East versus West wrestling iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka as director gives us the chance to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues are synchronised by Channing Tatum (also an executing producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is an ingenious idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are a few beautiful gags to look at (the police spends the time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent game 'Find out the voice'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so much involved in the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single.</seg>
<seg id="1206">With six long episodes, it moves along, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"" "" "" "Comrade Detective" "", "which has been reduced to a lesser length, could better deliver his Agitprop satire, since Gregor and Iosef keep visiting the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers." ""</seg>

<seg id="1211">The police shot a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="1212">On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Baar district, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the public prosecutor Constance filed on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1213">In doing so, 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and had already issued arrest warrants against them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">In addition, the officers established larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms as well as several hundred thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Two people were arrested in Italy during the same raid in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="1216">There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects Italians.</seg>
<seg id="1217">The two will probably be extradited to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1219">A total of more than 300 policemen were in use.</seg>
<seg id="1220">The members of the Mafia are accused of organized trafficking of drugs, heavy acts of violence, attempted murder as well as robbery and blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="1221">As early as summer 2016, the public prosecutor's office established Constance against organised drug trade in southern Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Between the public prosecutors in Constance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Cripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resized in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it's proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I looked for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with her and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot was completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steel work is quite complicated," "" "he explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it wasn't just about building a simple platform, but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement made it possible to place two rooms at full height above each other - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille illumination set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work for longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a little bit of engineering went inside," "" "explains Erfan of the reinforced, veneered MDF-door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it's important, so when you push the door, it glides very easily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a vestigial form, a real estate agent will enter and conduct a calculation based on the floor size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space while at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things that touch you and therefore help create an emotional attachment to a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you don't dearest into the electrical sockets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">"" "these are important, but they do not play with your heart." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of some standard in something quite amazing.</seg>

<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in a confrontation over one of the largest real estate imperialist Victorias worth more than $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and assets should be split.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to retire from family operations since 2014, but a sharp conflict about the separation takes place at the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers acquired 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 to USD 85 million.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De LUTIS now encompasses offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt. Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her dead father Colin - Paul describes as "principal operator and the dominant personality" in the De LUTIS family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court record states that Colin owns property worth 316 million dollars and Paul worth $176 million.</seg>

<seg id="1368">The brothers now also struggle to control the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul asserts, has excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul to manage some possessions incompetent.</seg>

<seg id="1373">Mrs. De LUTIS and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran dairy and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first denim of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he began Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, it will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on an even more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior officials on his first day of work, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trump White House, which he wanted to repair: poor information that was placed in the president's hands.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said to the staff that information should flow on him - whether on paper or briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring its media density.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumpy's relationship with television reaches decades back - and now, wherever he is in the White House, his television commercials are still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if Trump was angry with unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were to convince," "" "said former electoral adviser Sam Nunberg in February against Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politico Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keep the Twitter habit under control, according to six former electoral campaigns, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that the Twitter habit was ever" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials do not know what we do not know others - that without their interventions, trumps would have contained even more combustibles.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees were making it a few times to keep anger away from him, their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented the creation of Trump controversies.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, are trying to advance their own agenda by presenting trump material that could possibly promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">In May, Politico - dealing entirely with this story - reported about the preference of advisers to the president for strategic reasons without doubtful information.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react to negative press clippings like a volcano, especially those with damaged leaks, and find out where they come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">This is exactly what happened at the end of February when someone had maliciously accused the president of a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a heap of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banished from Twitter for harassment or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and has revoked it.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and began to question staff about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">"" "Goldmakers added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," "" "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork and to document the dump." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive for influence.</seg>

<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also income from the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In autumn 2014, in view of the dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the county, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation to the district council, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not disputed at that time in the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and even then spoke of serious interested parties at the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia Affair: U.S. Special Investigator sets Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair around US president Donald Trump, special genealogist Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The committee has resumed the work in recent weeks, writes the "Wall Street Journal" calling on people familiar with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper took the step as a sign that Mueller has widened and intensified his investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN broadcaster reported that there are already first summaries of the committee in connection with a meeting between the oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Us intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of interfering with the 2016 presidential election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were agreements between the election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigation focused on several men who acted as advisers to the Republicans during the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller took a close look at more and more trumps as a private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Investigator Trump went personally to the centre and investigate whether the president could possibly hinder the judiciary in the course of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jurys is to prove this evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether prosecution is to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called the Prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Most of the time, they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always done behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The body can also be engaged by the public prosecutor in order to invite individuals to take an oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to CNN, previous invitations have been issued which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were asked to testify, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In addition, they should provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Along with Trump Jr., Trump advisers and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his head-in-law, Paul Manafort, were in the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the substitution shows that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he would act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "" "" "but it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charging of an indictment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">However, the suspension of the committee was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for president Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "the Russian history is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "the issue gives the democrats a chance to" "" "feel good" "" "because they have nothing else about which they can talk about." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor, Ty Cobb, explained in a statement that he did not know anything about the establishment of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But he also usually works in secret, he emphasised.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "the White House endorses all measures that expedite the work of the Special Investigator in a" "" "fair" "" "way." ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">"" "" "" "the former FBI chief James Comey said three times that it was not against the president." ""</seg>
<seg id="1508">One has no reason to believe that something has changed, so it continued in the statement.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "because of this rationality, accusations against Trump have become loud, he has obstructed the judiciary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June of a Senate committee, Trump has asked him to set up investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">That sparked speculation as to whether Trump Mueller wanted to release Mueller.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent investigator of the Congress, such as the Watergate affair around the late President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the President's margins.</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">There were two groups of republican and democratic senators on Thursday that the Special Investigators could no longer be released so easily.</seg>

<seg id="1525">In total, however, for some 30 years there have been a series of unusual bursts of ice-snups in the region, writes the US research centre for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus has been part of the Larsen-C-Schelslab so far.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelcowl swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow further into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelslab is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this shelf life was disturbed by the balance of waxing and abstention a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete ice shelf.</seg>
<seg id="1533">It is worth mentioning that the Larsen-C-Schelice shelf is also in danger, because the front edge has never dropped as far as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate is under tension and can be broken if a piece breaks down at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of ice shelf and iceberg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and squeeze ice as much water as it produces after melting.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, Larsen-C-Schelslab is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica after AWI data with nearly 50,000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks periodically.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the most popular retreat since the beginning of records," "" "he also affirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">"" "scientists have argued whether the Larsen-C ice shelf will grow back or fall back in the long term and possibly collapse," "" "said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" "" "our models say that it will be less stable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers do not bring back the departure of this giant iceberg to climate change, many of the Antarctic Peninsula has fallen apart in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctic stretches in the direction of South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The rise in temperature contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has been warming up around three degrees in the past 50 years and is counting on the areas where the temperature is the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants to make house arif at staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vacant jobs, the CDU demands to step out of the employers' association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only shortly before the summer break, 41 new jobs in the administration had penetrated 41 new positions.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1,100 clerks and civil servants are working for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 trainees have had their first day of work.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The apprenticeships in the circle are obviously very much sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Some 620 applications for the places to be presented this year were to be recorded.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the group is still lacking personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At present, there are still 50 unoccupied positions in the Mettmann district.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as general administration forces.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU would now want to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "according to the request of the parties, the administration should" "" "develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to cover short-term needs for skilled workers but to counteract the future-oriented application shortage.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should orientate internally and externally, demonstrate concrete measures for cross-entry and include a training initiative, call for CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you did not know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "speech is from a real" "" "competition of public employers" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1569">"" "" "" "so it's high time for action so that there are no more places left unoccupied." ""</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Fuhrmann, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the joint motion with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He caused a bad surprise already in the circle day, when he publicly challenged the personnel costs and the other parties startled.</seg>

<seg id="1574">In this way the CDU is trying to pay better the employees and officials when it actually envisages the tariff for the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money is only available if you move to a higher level, which is oriented towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years.</seg>

<seg id="1582">Minnitis's warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat of the German aid organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their team had worked effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio's extensive allegations.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"for us, the salvation of human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone," the organisation said in a statement on the social media.</seg>

<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of overriding the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue missions in the area for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the Code of Conduct boats such as the Iuventa must first have an Italian police officer who supervises their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have previously agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring any "significant changes or disabilities" to their rescue operations.</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel laureate organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">Minniti has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures in Italy had declined sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.</seg>

<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">At E-Sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the soccer simulation FIFA will be contested at competitive level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, long ago, leagues have become established in which the pros compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And in the Asian Games in 2022 e-sport is already part of the official program.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a proper kind of sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certain to get used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobats has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and showing many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classic sports such as increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">It also requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical insight, and a fast response capability.</seg>

<seg id="1643">In three years, sales are expected to be at EUR 130 million.</seg>

<seg id="1751">One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The BMW leader said that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," and moved to European cities - including Munich where BMW is located - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the undertaking as a recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But nitrogen oxides which emit diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The costs for car manufacturers, systems for neutralizing the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles, also increase what makes it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of losing the powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called write-off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but to return to normal driving conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1760">In the United States, several Volkswagen employees were indicted, others are being examined on both sides of the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1762">The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1763">At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was expanded.</seg>
<seg id="1764">The involvement of Audi in the investigation could seriously strain Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer greatly contributes to Volkswagen's profit.</seg>

<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrant in Buenos Aires.</seg>

<seg id="1782">"" "" "" "the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," "" "he said once." ""</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match," and then in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again, the artist was inspired by cities.</seg>

<seg id="1795">Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change</seg>
<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of the conditions which are reminiscent of drought and due to diseases transmitted by scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, causing great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively at risk, because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"" "there is also a small iccade, a micro-bacterium, which transfers the Little Gocleiades, and in the case of very dry weather, there are many of them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil not only attracts tourists, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">"" "so we have fewer parts with essential oil." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly Rijeka are usually meeting wednesday in order to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the State of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists are discussing what feels safer: they should take their children into the office, which in 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government's salary list or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no break from violence, and while throughout the country the bodies are piling up, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are following attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven states this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and her inspirer of Rijeka, co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "Valdez also wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hanging on the facade of the Rijeka building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a German Federal Attorney General was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, the Committee for the Protection of Journalists only launched two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders linked every year to drug trafficking and organised crime, journalists are rarely brought to justice by journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting and even though the terrain is still more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why, we distrust everybody." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of 15 May, Valdez moved the office of the newspaper Rijeka to the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with "Twelve River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it close.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a wife and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of adorned, two-storeyed mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" if only a cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken by guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival card fractions in the war with Guzmans sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected gang members bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own security after the confiscation of another newspaper publishing the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing was considered a milestone in Mexican aggression against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for the Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues for the establishment of Rijeka and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug poison problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising grew.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters liked to be able to publish hard-fitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Rijeka, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award 'of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists for his courage in prosecuting the Mexican drug story wherever she was leading.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He willingly admitted that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "" "" "drug trade in Sinaloa" "" "is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "you must take on the task that you like as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb." ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what did you do in the face of so many dead... why didn't you say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun-bird, who could curse like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and sit there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine his destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death forced them to question their own assumptions about how they best carry out their work and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like to deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways and runways to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"" "" "" "these things were not allowed," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells bad, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">"" "the trouble is, the editor of the Rijeka Andres Villarreal said that" "" "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened with Javier." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggled smuggled, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where staff from Rijeka met for safety training, there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed. days before it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Rijeka in a four-storey building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves if these officers were among the 50 percent of the policemen who the governor was not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Rijeka has spent three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former famous xer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé on government spending, focusing on the governor's hometown.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that was in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, led through a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word on who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knows: that the restaurant is a favorite pub of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was recorded under the name of a politician who belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled almost all the political levels almost the entire century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-profile cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this pub, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.</seg>

<seg id="1886">Valdez's office became a storage room for notes and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped up a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning for another journalist for the office of the prosecutor.</seg>

<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and killing them because they told the truth.</seg>

<seg id="1936">"it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurier."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers found out that this herbivorous, although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, was probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as a counter-burial, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed him to get better in his surroundings and to avoid his enemies, say experts, suggesting that it has been threatened by bigger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines in May and is now in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markwithchelli according to the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to discover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter shading, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the countershading is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the animals today living.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It points out that the dinosaurs were hunted by dinosaurs eating enough pressure that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the counter shading - think of roe deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, which signalizes that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs prey must have been," "" "Brown said." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about his life, including his preserved intestine, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and pushed out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the seabed.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At this time Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans are probably more widespread inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is truly remarkable, because it is completely covered with conserved scaly skin but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," Brown said.</seg>

<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous period was a time when huge thermal diodes, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">To this belongs the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mumified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he buried at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the best-preserved dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from muzzle to hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that hung from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivorous was swept through Western Canada, until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail.</seg>

<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: unsuspecting you are sitting in the train and sleeping.</seg>

<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket control.</seg>

<seg id="1999">In order to be able to use this, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It is also necessary to buy the DB Navigator app, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And finally, you need a seat reservation.</seg>

<seg id="2006">When the train companion arrives at the ticket inspection at Place Y, he knows that a passenger is sitting there with an already validated online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, continue working, keep silent.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On August 9, 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Only one day after she arrived in New York City, she sat in St. Louis Giorene on the bed of an airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled over a post from someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "the police have just killed an 18 year old child, and it is still on the streets," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused as nobody else posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the area of St. Louis was to tweeter the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., live.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street and staying there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"" "" "" "that's wild," "" "said Ferrell." ""</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She stopped her cell phone in order to return later in the evening to Tweets about people on the Canfield-Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"" "there were photos of the police band and people shouting, and of a man claiming to be Browns father who wore a sign with the inscription:" "" "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In another video, she said, another policeman secured his gun and shouted, "I'll kill you... Animals all."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"" "" "" "this is not common," "" "recalls Ferrell." ""</seg>
<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "this is not the type of murder we have gotten used to and which we can call typical." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment, I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">"" "I was angry and wept." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would ride to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary, Whose Streets?, "in the cinemas from November 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience, which consists of the view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a flower-dress and a fitting crown, the two discussed a conversation that they had "over the black experience and the black state countless times before this morning."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "she remembered what she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "we are now going to Ferguson, because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right." ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">"" "I couldn't take it away," "" "said Ferrell later." ""</seg>
<seg id="2046">"" "" "" "what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past." ""</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know it and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black Constitution, and what we need to do to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I am fortunate enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women's child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "I feel that I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived at Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of officers Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for heel shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after 9 August," she said, and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis Presidency of the minority student Nurse Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">"" "everything has come." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">"" "Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to" "" "document" "" "what happened." ""</seg>
<seg id="2060">One question raised Ferrell in mind: "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often white people - in a community benefiting from their pain and their resilience.</seg>
<seg id="2062">"" "as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "" "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to make it different." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already collaborated with the co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todebecke inmates.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of Whose Streets? "in the years after Brown's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks with us. we're talking," Davis said.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "that was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, for so I will be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to concentrate on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - it turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, as she fell in love with her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"" "" "" "I felt like naked," "" "said Ferrell, laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I have understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrell's history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement who shaped the film "Blacklive Matter" in social media after the killing of the black teenager, Trayvon Martin, identified themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement together," "" "said Ferrell," "" "and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2074">"" "black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan agreed to note that" "" "the movement is really held by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">"" "however, it insists that" "" "this is not an affirmatized type of action," "" "when heel was selected as the heart of the film due to their identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2077">"" "" "" "she was the person who shook this energy," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "it is no accident, although it was at the forefront, because in a life at these junctions as a black, gay woman stands so much at stake." ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">"" "you can feel their energy through the screen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2080">In the meantime, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial lines between the community and the police continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless she clings to a song and she feels bound to this memory since she went to the street three years ago in Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"" "" "" "it is our duty to fight for our freedom." ""</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "megalomania": TV-readers discuss about bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though they are not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping mall at the south end of the pedestrian precinct has been split by supporters and opponents since the first presentation of 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold leaves the subject hard.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"" "the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page" "" "Volksfreund Bitburg" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2093">"" "while one can say to the bit gallery:" "" "that would be a dream" "" "(Anja Becker) or" "" "that would be real great" "" "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" "" "don't need a person" "" "(Siggi Betzen) or quite simply:" "" "megalomania!" "" "(Lars Scholz)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the proponents are building a gallery more customers move into the city, from which the other businesses benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the plot on which the farmers market hall is located, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This will end with the beginning of the construction work.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Beda-Platz with the possibility to sit outside.</seg>

<seg id="2109">You can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a weekly market place, it is even more important that at least the market hall remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shop shops are rented in a shopping mall only by larger companies, because the mids there are often not portable for a retailer.</seg>

<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a mall with a market hall fits me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the farmers market hall look like during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes eventually.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does the Gespenst Bit gallery already manage to sell all the shops in Bitburg? "</seg>

<seg id="2122">But thanks to the unbelievably many - as I can find - there is no room for senseless construction projects in Bitburg for a farmer's market hall.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the farmers market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A fitting similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks-tuppers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after having publicly launched diplomatic reports on WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is named A Becoming resemblance.</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline singled out her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and groundbreaking dissident, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he only had three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">According to the algorithmic analysis of DNA, which was extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits, as someone with these genomic data could look like, a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual commentary was created not only in the form of DNA data - the many ways they interpret and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Her picture was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie, sitting visibly uncomfortable on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum blonde wig - with whom she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was just hit by the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts like cigarette stub and chewing gum, extracting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people might look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"" "" "" "they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "" "explained Dewey-Hagalla at a press preview of the new exhibition." ""</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit at that time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her jailed muse were turned into unequal letters, which in the course of two years exchanged several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"" "they even created a comic" "" "Suppressed Images" "" "illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the President of Chelsea would transform judgment and she would be able to personally see the exhibition." ""</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama really was only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas would be a welcome form of happy coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweezable ways to further inflame the rigid splits he was supposed to fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things she said that "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning concluded with her oversized signature underneath (the "i" in her surname is equipped with a heart) an end of "automatic fragmentation" whose basis sex, race, sexuality and culture have been. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">With the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), Dewey-Hagalla had hoped to show how astonishingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people hope to take with it is that our genome is not responsible for who we are and how openly genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also visible.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic book.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning how she emerges with a hands-free hands from the disciplinarian tanks of the United States such as King Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2152">"" "" "" "it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "" "said the artist who greeted me from Philadelphia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it, it will be welcomed in the middle of space by the masks, from their own genomic simulations, which gather like hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition until the size (5 "2, Manning Stature), where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg on the portraits.</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure the luck with your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - deceptive.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity some workers did not mourn the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was never any consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">It has called people from outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is at the waxing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to perform surveys, offer specific groups and demographic groups, employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases, whistleblowers allow to bypass the C-Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap-Polls and Surveys from certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low tuned results - so that you can post, why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you are not the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken were punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like GLINT, this wish is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion by 2020, following the financial technical site Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the Uber-Fall in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Cent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">As GLINT, Convercent will send you tailor-made "Pulse" Surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows staff to report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"public opinion polls the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences by consumers boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has employed Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company uses Convercent, problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed faster - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience of employment," "" "said Vitrano, who runs the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>

<seg id="2231">Companies began to take Ethics, Values and Employees Commitment in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>

<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Convercent offer your software as a service, and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">"" "" "" "it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups." ""</seg>
<seg id="2236">Cent received $10 million in funding in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glistening secured $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The staff want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"" "" "" "if people are happy to be in a company that is their votes and that the work they do is worthwhile, they feel more committed to making this company successful," "" "said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and GLINT." ""</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors gain reputation when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase engagement and deployment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the caretakers of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks staff for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the Shift is not fast enough or not at all, it can grow disappointments and demotiate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"" "" "" "if you ask for 4.000 ideas, you must be prepared to have 4,000 talks," "" "said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data." ""</seg>

<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported about GLINT, so Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize multiple teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">In Ruby Tuesday, the company will always get new insights into the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better retention of employees in an industry that is well-known for high turnover.</seg>

<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged ties to the movement of the Exile Preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as the wirepuller of the coup attempt.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it won't be even more crazy in 2017, there's a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking their ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make fun of it, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them more often," "" "Mr. Sharkey said in the publication of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also "adjust" his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot via the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it becomes even more worrying as many robots have the" "" "personalities" "" "that would make a steppe-woman look progressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there's the Roxxxy gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of timidity and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible," "" "says True Companion's website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, it also has its moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "it can be tired to be fixed on conversation or it can be" "" "in mood" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape, if one goes one step on Frigid (means here: reluctant) Farrah, restless one the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On its website True Companion Roxxxy was compared with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?" is it on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and their increasing refinement point to something more dense and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men, of course, will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR remembers their rising popularity they still remain on the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what transpires from the marginal zones can be very instructive in relation to the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2414">However, there is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time where women's rights are threatened all over the world, in which there is a president in the White House who boasted women being sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most frightening aspect of the TV series' The maid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the entwined body and the eyes out, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots is to establish a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their constructors want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, brought to the point when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots are not real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no communication or background story, nothing that suggests independence or anything that might disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are bogus slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to put it in the statement of 2017: maid service</seg>
<seg id="2424">Pumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of a healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized US voters have also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving Day there were newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horrors of Trump-Choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all trying to make our filter bubbles burst.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noted is the power of mumps to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House everyone whom she knows, including the republican relationship with which she had fought for decades for politics, is suddenly and completely strange on the same page.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it is obvious to me that this also involves considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the provocative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we talk about" "" "normalization" "" "and" "" "Trump" "", "we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his kittens will no longer be thrown away." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republican normalizes the right wing, which suddenly appears as a term of reasonableness in comparison with its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself now infested by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both in comparison to Trump are indeed a very mild crime.</seg>
<seg id="2438">If Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republican only needs to be mentally healthy in order to qualify as immeasurable enhancement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest carousel in the New York Parks Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are creaty and the animals twist in order to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the klimpering music conveys this in a curious way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines are too familiar to provide a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage - the Topic Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park Carousel is still a strange magic experience, as two two-year-old, 11-year-old and two women in the 40-twenties can go on it and have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, during this week I was forced to assess my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need arises.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was apologizing, while I was tired of experiencing my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius transferred to hospital with chest pain</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorius left the prison for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year, he was hospitalised for the treatment of carving in his wrists, according to the prison authorities, after a fall in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">After an appeal of the prosecutors, Pistorius was sentenced to a first death-seat.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day in 2013, taking it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria on her.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed he had his girlfriend for a nighttime intruder hiding in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appeal, of which they say she is too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The National Prosecutor's Office said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>

<seg id="2534">We make the city worth living</seg>
<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, is going to retire next year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The place is already written - but suitable candidates are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">For 31 years, Wacker has been a city master builder.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work is still a lot of fun to him, as he teaches in the press conference.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports of varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, it is surprising that no application has yet to fulfil the requirement profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the earliest possible date.</seg>
<seg id="2542">In this way - taking into account the regular periods of notice - there is still enough time for a familiarization.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach is acting as a sub-law office for the Administrative Community, the applicant must present corresponding agreements.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If they were unable to fill them any more, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But the proximity to the city is important to the city and to it itself, says Wacker, who reports from a good working atmosphere as well as a good mood between the authorities and citizens.</seg>
<seg id="2547">Over 30 years in office, a number of significant projects have gathered to look back at the Wacker with pride.</seg>
<seg id="2548">"" "" "" "we make the city worth living," "" "he is sure about the construction department and its staff." ""</seg>
<seg id="2549">But also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla-Areals and the Niederhofen Park are about to be initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2550">The Kinzig Bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, and the stadium refurbishment is still a topic.</seg>
<seg id="2551">"" "the latter only will strike some 1.5 million euros," "" "if we do it right," "" "says Wacker." ""</seg>
<seg id="2552">"all in all great tasks await my successor.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">In terms of design, there is considerable leeway for a city master builder.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Haslachs's own yard and gardener can react to many things flexibly.</seg>
<seg id="2556">"" "" "" "you can move a lot," "" "says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors." ""</seg>
<seg id="2557">As the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in," when new buildings are approved, the outgoing urban builder emphasises.</seg>
<seg id="2558">Anyway, the architect has a high level of responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="2559">"" "he is the client," "" "in the end everything runs over my table." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2560">With care and coordination, he can count on many years of staff: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been there for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) has been there for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2561">Also that his successor remains for a long time, Wacker wants: "we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place."</seg>
<seg id="2562">Continuity is not only important for a good working climate but also for the further design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">If you want to be able to inherit Roland Wacker, you should be able to instruct the city of Haslach as a graduate engineer or a bachelor's degree in architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and construction planning.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The municipal construction department is subject to high and civil engineering, construction planning, undermining opportunities, administration of urban properties, urban depot with building yard and urban gardeners as well as the Lower Building Law Department, including monuments conservation.</seg>

<seg id="2568">The investigators go out of two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night.</seg>

<seg id="2574">The damages had been repaired on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the south-rail track could be guided without obstructions.</seg>
<seg id="2575">Nearly ten people had fallen off on Friday morning, two of them entered the correspondence.</seg>
<seg id="2576">Freight trains did not fall out, but they were delayed.</seg>
<seg id="2577">According to ÖBB-spokesman Christoph Posch, some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study says exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affecting around 1.3 million in the US and in the UK 300,000 causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrolling in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes, which hide in the food, do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to cause inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments it was found that a type of tolerance promoting immune cells occurs in mice carrying a specific bacterium in their bowels.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an on tryptophan diet tolerant diet tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus promotes, if the same system also applies to humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan researched a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which, however, had not had this.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiome of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and six bacterial species were found that were present in mice with the immune cells, but were missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were created by the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers sent L. reuteri into a liquid and then passed small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on immature immune cells isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleaned from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, which is known as an Indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's feed, the number of cells increased by approximately 50 percent, but if the tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said:" "" "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">"" "potentially high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2634">The Green Federal Executive Director Michael Kellner has called on the backsliding Lower Saxony Green Party member Elke Tests to return their mandate.</seg>

<seg id="2639">It is the provisional climax of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD state associations.</seg>
<seg id="2640">And nobody knows what comes next.</seg>
<seg id="2641">The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March.</seg>
<seg id="2642">A blue eye, not more, the comrades were reassuring at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After the legislative elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.</seg>

<seg id="2650">And because in crisis communication he did everything wrong with what you can do wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.</seg>
<seg id="2652">So now also Stephan Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2653">Because of the VW Exhaust and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Lower Saxony's Prime Minister has long been criticised.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Slight changes in demand were added.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil has always tried to establish accents in the Confederation over the past few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2656">The ambitions of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin also did not remain hidden in the context of Martin Schulz.</seg>

<seg id="2675">Since 1991, there have been some sanitation areas.</seg>
<seg id="2676">At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land Baden-Württemberg had taken over two-thirds of the funding amount.</seg>

<seg id="2680">The funding amount amounts to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros would come from the country, the rest of the community's feelings.</seg>

<seg id="2682">"" "one would, as Schindler further, investigate, where the" "" "really old" "" "houses are." ""</seg>
<seg id="2683">But it also plays a role as to whether in the planned area there is any interest in sanitising.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If necessary, the territorial borders may also shift again.</seg>

<seg id="2686">"" "Keller presented the contents of the federal program" "" "Social City" "", "where the renovations would then be carried out." ""</seg>

<seg id="2692">In November or December, it should take place as soon as possible, so that the renovation can begin next year.</seg>

<seg id="2715">The White House decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing in the last month costs taxpayers according to the military provided to the TIME magazine, up to 24,000 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="2718">In addition to a yacht made of Maine, a fireman made of Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi, the helicopter produced in Connecticut was exhibited.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or cargo, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it, because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event, the deputy commander of the Naval Aviation Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The news showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o'clock in the morning at 7 o'clock in the morning at the South Lawn for the event, and so long stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on that evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, a second crew is required for the return flight due to restricting service hours.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original flight crew was during the event with the helicopter while the security personnel of the unit remained on the plane during the time on the plane.</seg>
<seg id="2724">From the recordings provided by the TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act forbids federal employees to use state property for political purposes.</seg>

<seg id="2742">A spokesman for Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in exporting the helicopter to the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">HMX-1 does not maintain budget labels for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.</seg>
<seg id="2744">According to the hourly rate of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per flight.</seg>
<seg id="2745">Records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-report on the misuse cases relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann says.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weissler, speaker of the reform movement "Wir sind Kirche," declared after publication in relation to the German press agency, he expected from the former Regensburg Bishop and current Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then incorrect evaluation of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican newspaper" Osservatore Romano "" "" on the other hand criticized that in reporting about violence in the domes of domes with "" "" double standards "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="2895">In regard to the assaults in Regensburg no one doubted that it would be "shameful and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; but the author Lucetta Scaraffia, Historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "" "one would like to go to the church and it's a devoured fresher." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that in her youth" "" "blows were a normal pedagogical means" "" "to be done with cheeky children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">It would be unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on the misuse cases, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann writes, who wrote with Ratzinger the "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he assesses the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report submitted by the Bishum Regensburg to the Enlightenment Attorney Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were subjected to sexual abuse between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s with high plausibility.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, says: "in summary, it can be said that many cases of physical and psychological violence have been used by Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially in the case of high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more intense.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, contrary to numerous other allegations, many victims have appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even bring positive memories to him despite violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Heshemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger seems to be relieved.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Heshemann, the 440-page report on the "Incidents of the Exercise of Protection of Violence at the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a conflicting picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for one, many students emphasise his" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it appears as choleriker and perfectionist, which became handy when a Domspatz brought no top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long story from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is common in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is particularly devoted to eight pages and he is clearly spoken of every suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the pre-school also took place outside its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">At best it is possible to reproach him, to experience it too late or to have taken first hints seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the" "" "Domspatzengymnasium" "", "on which he worked, was felt by virtually all the respondents as - literally -" "" "redemption," "" "" heaven "" "" and "" "" better world "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="2918">The vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also provides an excellent certificate, described him as "warm-hearted," "skilled" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy, and "always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to rage eruptions.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he did not only snooze with chairs and threw the mudlock on the floor, but he also distributed earthen ears and too cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "to his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widely used in the questionable period, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents and teachers." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know such methods of breeding?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the violent excesses of violence at the preschool, they are of course bagatellen.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it is not to do with his familiarity and role as the brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just rushed to him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many people who have never understood him are still working diligently on the Bavarian Pope.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report ratifies Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, a lot has been reported in connection with the report on the subject of abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger also involved in any involvement or involvement with regard to sexual abuse in the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claimed to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "" "said one of the afflicted," "" "It was all very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in educating sexual abuse was, however, that most victims remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir director, who would have been a colleague of the culprits in a professional manner.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen pupil rate Ratzinger's role with regard to the misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it like this: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely evidence and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... even to be really absurd to assume that it was to him... Bubs more intrusive or clearer or more opened than towards their parents, interns, trusts of trust, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report concludes with a clear result:" "" "that the students and / or their surroundings affected him in advance could not be confirmed as part of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is free to speak of any co-existence.</seg>
<seg id="2943">He cannot be accused of preventing or displaying him.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to associate a good name with these refutable crimes, as happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "there was a lot of" "" "violent excesses" "" "in the media to read in the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister, Georg Ratzinger, is accused of" "" "looking away" "" "in the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything was mixed up in the reporting and mixed into a huge orange melange of sexual abuse and violent excesses and somewhere, right in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is in turn a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Because it is separated cleanly: between the pre-school and the high-school of the domes, between sexual abuse and violent excesses and, let's say, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, so also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the chorus of the Cathedral Sparrows.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were literally harassled and maltreated, and suffered from them, all happened at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those whom Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only to face when they were already at the cathedral-cat-school-nasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on this, like most of the witnesses, the theme of" "" "primary school" "" "was taboo." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">"" "one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even" "" "paradisiacal" "" "conditions." ""</seg>
<seg id="2956">What else was different at the cathedral-cat-school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic power.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims appreciate the general humanity of R." "" "and therefore in numerous cases even unite positive memories with him in numerous cases." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">At most, the reproach still remains to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he just started to establish himself and from the events at a school in which he did not work and was responsible, (thus the witness) wanted to hear nothing, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently shut the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the high school gymnasium, which the report was even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out," "" "that in the preparatory school there will continue to be the punishment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed when Prüfer's penalties were banned in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that they took place in a legal grey-zone, as each of us knows well.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate, where the sufferers might be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">It was only in 1980 that the capital punishment of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis insists that it is unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael hesemann:" "" "historians are talking about the" "" "snare of anachronism" "", "i.e. the risk of assessing the past according to today's moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this of course does not apply to sexual abuse, which has been abhorrent at all times, and not for what has been banned in the preschool of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond that at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very horrible and I am glad that it will finally work.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take protection from Georg Ratzinger because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of discipline and punishment, that is to say earrings and ears and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When corporal punishment was then banned, he kept strictly adhering to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which picture of his Regensburg time did Georg Ratzinger play in talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of the trial judge also speak in the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI tells from his perspective that the Cathedral Sparrows played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I do not at all show that he led a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said once: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang from the hitherto nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, the true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone, one does not make a big singer out of unruly boys and every success, whatever the area, but always discipline, passion and overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people have you experienced as Georg Ratzinger at the conversations with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I have met Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful, humorous, grounded, deep-believing and heartily-hearted people, of whom you can't imagine that he could only do something for a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get contact with him, like many former Domspatzen today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly visit him, read it, read it - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who did not forgive him until today that he was strictly speaking to them are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the domes are thankful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, of course, that may be - but also a lovely respectable person, to which they still look up today and which they almost revere.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, again clearly: everything you accuse to him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unfair to make a man just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make a media scapegoat.</seg>
