28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping mall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother claimed that he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally it went uphill again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ pse found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gal@@ ici@@ a from San Francisco , divided the medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations are underway .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a , shared the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco with that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had won his dream job six months ago as a chef at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters \ &apos; s restaurant in San Francisco .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed on the ground &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time at Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a admitted that Frank first lived in host@@ els , but that &quot; things went up for him finally . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a said that he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; joining his family with his family was to always bring us something to cook , prepare us for dinner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who swa@@ m with the stream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond shining bri@@ ghtly every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information on the case will be asked to call the round of the SF@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I will always be put into drawers
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston won &apos;t always have to be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star has made it unmistak@@ ably clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will always be put into drawers or stuck from outside labels which have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself don &apos;t have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are rather wet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
the act@@ ress loves to spend her time at home , in front of TV with a loose de@@ bris and Mexican food , it &apos;s called in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for white glu@@ t , it brings the question of the desire for children : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film Mother &apos;s Day - love is not a children &apos;s game &quot; Ani@@ ston is to be seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film is running on August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sport@@ pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger visited with some colleagues a bit of change with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday , they hun@@ ted at the fast gal@@ lo@@ p home to the for@@ age trou@@ ghs .
one kilometer at that pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and that was the end of the riding career .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament wins - was close to horses .
he talked to his family about the arrangement of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even swear by photo purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and with it also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid supplied the man from An@@ hausen in a small gala the Golden Py@@ ramid of Sports .
there is no lack of hon@@ ours to the symp@@ athetic athlete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes lau@@ rel blatt , Champion @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already car@@ essed him .
long is the 18th Prize winner of the Sport@@ pyramid .
he met the first lau@@ re@@ ate Hans Günter Win@@ kler in Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lan@@ ger says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has been supporting the offspring .
and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros equal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master winner was included on Saturday in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the winners include the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ engen , the F@@ echter Cor@@ nel@@ ia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ us@@ ch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the Spring@@ reiter al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand @-@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports legends have come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company mig@@ rated to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza prize was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger was by far to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and s@@ ling@@ backs economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing the T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two U.S. Pres@@ idential candidates are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue .
the difference in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical difference .
about the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep them in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to regulate death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely go back to regulations , and he is strongly committed to a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has to fulfil certain tasks ; it has opportunities to open dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it .
that is why the taxes for the rich will be increased , &quot; she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the future , investments must be invested , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tr@@ ump and Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the democratic applicant even announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apar@@ ty wing of the Republi@@ cans .
so there could be no party discussions on Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the differences in energy and climate policy are more significant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and return coal mining to the USA .
oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement wants to cancel it .
Clinton , on the other hand , wants to explicitly expand renewable energy with its investment programme and demands : &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want we to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - even with international trade agreements , the two competitors are not far from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ fic trade agreement , both do not want to sign .
at the same time both want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but simply to better protect American jobs .
they should be paid better than Clinton .
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a famine .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to rise , then he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump is standing who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics point out that the budget deficit would be even greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich , stands that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing alone .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ sed .
a house offers refuge .
there are four women sitting in a large kitchen .
each person has a baby , which is at most one year old .
one has put her little son in his arm .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is a division manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a contribut@@ or to social services in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are f@@ owl .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentr@@ alised accommodations for single @-@ wing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs opened the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich @-@ based Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they are threatened with torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a ray of hope &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are other reasons for the escape in women : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honor killing , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
that drives them away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that tu@@ gs are demanding a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
those who believe that the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , ir@@ re tells B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and at worst mis@@ used .
this means that about 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in Munich &apos;s north are trau@@ mati@@ sed , they appreciate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are used to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they do not dare to talk openly about what they have experienced , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as they often don &apos;t know how to help , they need more accommodations only for them , B@@ ahr demands .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees .
on the question of whether or not they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their sphere of competence , some answer no .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia there is no such thing in the accommodation of governments .
also in Sw@@ ab@@ ia only escaped women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Spo@@ kes@@ person of the Government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are floors or homes for single women and their children in some community shel@@ ters .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the Committee it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are shel@@ ved separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no lack of privacy or if men and women are accommod@@ ated , it can become - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , is available in the study .
how much women feel this need of protection can be read at the urge to enter the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have been talking about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second home .
assistance physicians strike : demands for new measures to combat labour
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistant physicians have called their union to appro@@ ve new labour campaign measures in their disputes with respect to a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more campaign measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers had agreed to deal with the concerns about the contract .
in July , assistance doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract that was agreed with the BM@@ A .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in elections .
in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; to problems , resulting in the rejection of the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inde@@ ed , the J@@ DC Board has voted in favour of completely rej@@ ecting the proposed new treaty and promp@@ ting official ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation for all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today announced a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating labour competition measures starting at the beginning of September .
the disputes led to the fact that resident doctors filed six times this year , the first general failures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A Assistance Physi@@ cians Dr. Johann Mal@@ a@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistant physicians and medical students , so that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t , said that the contract for doctors in England would be forci@@ bly launched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gesture which ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin is receiving his Turkish opposite player in the gil@@ ded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile was sli@@ pper@@ y and he hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if something bad had never happened .
to me his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ating , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing .
on the contrary , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the down@@ turn of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to that time was rage .
Putin condemned Ankara , acc@@ using Ankara to turn Russia into the back .
the expul@@ sion was even greater , as it was committed by a supposed friend .
building the c@@ ous@@ ins is difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media launched a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
the most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria areas controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has v@@ ehem@@ ently denied this .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received an ap@@ ology from President Erdo@@ gan to listen to .
Russia was able to make a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire lie clearly on the hand .
Erdo@@ gan first needs all the friends he can get after he has been reli@@ eved during a failed coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at last month .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey severely - especially the prohibition of charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght of the Mediterranean .
this week , the state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agr@@ arian imports are allowed to return .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ č@@ sti says it follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious at the West as it regards its response to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the continued res@@ ent@@ ment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to withdraw from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian head of state won in Ankara with security a bonus that after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat he demanded support for the elected state organs .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep fear of regime change .
the summit in this glorious palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present , as an analy@@ st once described , &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders . &quot;
nevertheless , in spite of public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents said at the press conference that they had not even st@@ alled the issue .
the president of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences while Putin decided to emphasize them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hostili@@ ties - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey shot off the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state are at least talking to each other .
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available to customers outside of Scotland
according to the Bank &apos;s Board of Directors , the R@@ BS brand should only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank dis@@ soci@@ ated itself when it had to be nearly collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer finance brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from six Nations ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to put more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alised headquarters and the stock exchange report to Nat@@ West will change .
Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for retail banking that are more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investor brand and the brand among which our employees will be busy as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am now saying that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers under these brands .
R@@ BS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to become a bank of brands , because how do we focus within ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Board of Directors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands .
but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think one will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori achieves its 3,@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ yed champagne after a double in New@@ market , bringing him 3,@@ 000@@ th win
Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured its 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he set a milestone on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m very emotional because my family is here as well
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the ju@@ bil@@ ation when he gets the victory on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career paths
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey in modern times and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone , which only a few have achieved before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect that distingu@@ ishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for racing , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma have been enth@@ r@@ alling fans for years for this sport .
I told Frank@@ ie some weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already caught 6,000 gains if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has aged nearly 30 years in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; in 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a ban on drugs .
three years ago , he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and return to his best form .
and he hasn &apos;t finished yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue at competitions up to his at least fifty year old .
Russian Putin firing Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin recently dismissed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the narrow@@ est confidence circle of Putin many years ago .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old has been appointed as Special Represent@@ ative for Environment and Transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , it is stated that without giving reasons , Putin had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ordered the discharge of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as President of the Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was a substitute for Ivan@@ ov@@ s since 2012 , was named after his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in Tall@@ inn , Est@@ onian capital in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it is called ( in Russian ) that he was later the administrator and chief of staff of the government officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that it is the government &apos;s main task to support your work as head of state concerning bills of law and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with Ivan@@ ov asked him to leave his post and recommend V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
do the smiling faces convince you ?
this step has made Moscow more mysterious .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest familiar Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ igned on his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
is this the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at this time .
but the official claim - that a man who was once tou@@ ted as a potential president , at once intended to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great skep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , quoted on the Krem@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to give me this very complicated post - one could almost say - to entr@@ ust some ar@@ du@@ ous items for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Pres@@ idential administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the position in December 2011 .
prior to that he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin is a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he named Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted most .
it was once believed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia , since a third term Putin had viol@@ ated the Constitution .
but this post was taken by another ally close ally Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became prime minister before he became president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced their termination in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed publicly on Thursday before the announcement of his dis@@ miss@@ al .
on the set it came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how Gib@@ son &apos;s character from the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , is expected to be published at a later date , according to the ABC Studio and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood in the last 12 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that will no longer be possible .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a show .
the planned radiation of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
ri@@ dd@@ les for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a villa@@ in of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that with the 75 Pis@@ ces he could act as Sand@@ als , which were sp@@ iced out by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ wear Crossing : crossing the bridge with Fi@@ fe
the project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
engineers have connected the north deck of the Que@@ ens@@ holiday cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is connected now with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closing stages of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deck b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge cut from Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 be@@ vels .
the project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister for Economic Affairs , Keith Brown , visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when building Que@@ ens@@ holiday cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of engineering art from a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky job that requires extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit .
all in all , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck is in place , and the last section of the deck is now available in Ros@@ y@@ th for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of the For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of future @-@ oriented high and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last street @-@ deck and its connection with the north tur@@ m@@ deck in the expansion , we had to close the still existing gap on the northern or land side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 mil@@ lim@@ eter south .
this was a massive and very delicate activity at the same time .
massive as the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards in an incl@@ ine of approx . 3 % .
delicate because the toler@@ ances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck still alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown by their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station sounded alarm at 13 : 20 BS@@ T after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men strug@@ gled to swim in safety while their boat moved on from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and set off the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately the strong winds have already blown the boat apart from their reach , until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found on a boat hanging without a life@@ jacket .
they were all aboard the coast rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water were lucky enough to be alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the boat engine had an emergency stop , it loos@@ ened the boat from the person who was ste@@ aling the boat .
someone w@@ akes over these men today .
seriously injured - man bo@@ ils down to his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
as the police informed yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the keys to the apartment to get his personal things .
instead , the alcoholic bl@@ ends the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when she came into the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and the body .
the police were able to arrest the perpetrators .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed his ex @-@ girlfriend &apos;s clothes , he called his mother .
this then al@@ armed his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
she couldn &apos;t move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ wife in the street .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old chu@@ ck@@ led his sister and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who is building Braunschwei@@ ger cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens mean : investors should be taken a lot more strongly in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 affordable housing in the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; room for action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next council meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but stri@@ fe is inevitable .
first of all , the question is : who should build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann comments : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : if you want to build on urban areas , 20 percent of all apartments will have to exhibit as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the favorable housing , however , can also arise in the continu@@ ance .
the big issue in the town hall is , however , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; how to deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban housing development programme that will cost millions and will still have to be financed is intended to provide incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is no agreement between the fac@@ tions right now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few rules as possible .
the left wants even tough@@ er conditions for investors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brat@@ mann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a worsen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the concept of action is implemented , it will provide additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the programme is still not complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you reconci@@ le the loss of further 1300 inexpensive apartments whose promotion will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the budget@@ ary spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm should now be hired out of the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought about returning apartments back to the price binding .
this is possible in the western city .
the problem could be solved at one stroke .
for the end of the year , there will be a number of dead@@ lines in the western city .
in 1800 apartments you could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing associations .
because the number of social housing in the western city is dramatically increased , it is removed from the target of the so @-@ called mixing .
there should be no more concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in just a few neighbour@@ hoods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens expect there to be movement in the discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although they have concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can still be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunting for health and happiness
it is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
that teen@@ age and child can no longer go outside to play , but rather prefer to spend their spare time sitting on screens , was lam@@ ented over the last decade by many .
at Pok@@ em@@ on Go , it &apos;s about getting people off the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and most recently on smartphones .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities don &apos;t mutually exclusive each other .
I naturally refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on characters created for video games in the 1990s ( later they created a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
as many phenomena of pop culture the interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand decreased at the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed due to the massive demand that the servers over@@ loaded .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go out with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ em@@ ons tracking with a GPS , and once they have been found , they will be &quot; photographed &quot; ( using a screen@@ shot on your mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the ahn and le@@ apt for the search of the sofa .
in the US , the game resulted in a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person returns every day .
car@@ dio , an app for Apple Watch , tracking 3@@ 5.000 users , announced the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of followed people who train every day 30 minutes , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely sees the raw data for improving performance .
many public awareness campaigns on health people want to &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; time , &quot; coming from the sofa , &quot; and &quot; being active every day &quot; touched deaf ears because many public messages are dull to health and come from people looking miserable .
nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ rated .
those who regularly exercise sports will reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that is fun for them .
thus , three pillars of health are covered - motion , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as always , there are also towers that have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what to do ?
a breakthrough occurred .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they didn &apos;t give us a reason to do sports as this game does .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be dimin@@ ished with time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ on &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active , fit@@ ter and healthier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ al creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ al is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
eff@@ ort@@ lessly on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant on whole line .
and now finally the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast spoke on Thursday to the multi @-@ championship title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
their total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mates A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alli@@ st Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ a .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es tur@@ nes on the floating bar during the single multi @-@ day campaign of women in gymnas@@ tics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ esh is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who wins a multi @-@ battle title and overall the fifth while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her end result was shown and her long journey at this moment ended .
this success introduces them to the same league as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ esh has dominated her sport for the last three years , 15 world championships , including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue from her said that she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she expected a final examination in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ esh and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered disappointment .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after they have won gold and silver in the single multi @-@ competition women of the women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ al took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as ex@@ clamation mark at the farewell ceremony of the team coordinator , Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i , who retired .
although Bil@@ ba@@ e insisted on having never planned the future during her long journey , this is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no accident .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school trip to the gym where Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , it has not lost any competition for competition , a series of victories that will last as long as it wishes .
even if Mu@@ staf@@ a easily led through two turns , the picture dec@@ ep@@ ted .
Swedish Be@@ ams and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - lau@@ ded .
she re@@ treated with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the balance beam again - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor another one on it .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently as she expected her death - a pure form of form@@ ality - and tears f@@ lowed on cheap glossy red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collective book became reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a ven@@ ge@@ ance for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went to Mu@@ staf@@ a in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man captains , who is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a head start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her ground exercise , she threw her back to the public , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed doub@@ t@@ ful .
as far as Bil@@ al is concerned , the rapidly expanding T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims shot in series mur@@ dering in the car listening to music
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , killed in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ rator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ held fire weapon while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police informed that the triple murder did not appear to be the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y attack because the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who owned one of the adult victims .
the police spokesman at Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they were linked to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed and two more wounded in his@@ panic neighbor@@ hoods within four months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Ca@@ dil@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which resulted in an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the thre@@ ef@@ old murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball fragment from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with a micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it gets better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the least of his people , Ed@@ mund Mikro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to did not know anything during her pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I don &apos;t manage that .
I don &apos;t manage that .
I did not let go of that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is wrong at all -- of course , one has embark@@ ed on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to see them and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alize him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a subsi@@ dy .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l until his third year of age and he still cannot speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
he can run with support and cycle .
he also loves playing and singing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund asked for &quot; Please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; we teach him sign language , &quot; says Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical sign language -- it says . Ed@@ mund invented some signs by himself .
micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as at Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the z@@ ic@@ a@@ virus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it &apos;s still too early to say how it will affect the life of infected with the Z@@ ik@@ a@@ virus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I asked constantly , what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
I haven &apos;t asked for pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect someone to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Z@@ ik@@ a@@ virus .
it will be better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy ra@@ inf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives rise to ba@@ il@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on the emergency stand on Friday .
numerous rivers in the south @-@ east of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded its banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ding after extreme ra@@ inf@@ all , the National Weather Service reported .
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards stated that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and help the communities affected .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesman for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , told that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand bags were increasing .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the community of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested ten thousand sand bags .
a flood warning system is used for large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service announced that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was used on Friday , while it was still ra@@ ining in the Mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river A@@ mite close to Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ al@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ tmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these are only slowly flowing into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as via the well @-@ tro@@ dden rivers .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi national border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest state ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams still hat@@ ched people from flood water in the districts of A@@ mite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed near Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet from his house , grew strongly overnight .
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water f@@ lowed and poured in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife said to Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level in the 48 years in which she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members were all han@@ dicapped and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ tmann said the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ loo@@ ding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread out quickly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there continued heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and that the authorities would consider ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ tmann an observer reported in the proximity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inch rain .
K@@ rau@@ tmann said that the ground had been considerably weighed down by the rain@@ falls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and street floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and school failure in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary , WW@@ F , reported that an or@@ derly in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches which were both flooded .
the Chief of the Municip@@ ality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals r@@ ins@@ ed by floods .
in the cities of A@@ mite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the ev@@ acu@@ ated people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the community of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of roads were closed because of the floo@@ ding and sand bags were provided for the residents who hope to keep the water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ ville of the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the disaster manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his information , a handful of houses were reported to have been reported as flooded on Thursday , but on Friday they were not reported .
Keith T@@ own@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in A@@ mite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I &apos;ve seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; said T@@ own@@ son , &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bul@@ ked by bul@@ lets &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police tells us that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 year old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shot wounds , including lung , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in hospital at his transport to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his little body was blown away by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the station that he is likely to recover again .
he would have started the first class at a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found at the front seat of a car with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who finds himself in a critical condition , reports the station .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetrators .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that there was apparently a cross @-@ fire between several sho@@ oters .
cartridge shells for assault rif@@ les , which have been traced back to various assault rif@@ les , ab@@ duc@@ ted the crime scene .
it seems that this was clearly an ongoing battle .
on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were seals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it seems to have given here several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also found in the area .
there was no arrest and police are currently re@@ viewing the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 year old girl was hit by a qu@@ ag@@ ger at the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she re@@ covers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympic Championship in the Tur@@ ns and that for more than one reason .
first of all , since 1984 I have been with every summer Olympics , and the USA has never been so dominant .
and second : this team has three gym@@ na@@ sts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who had an inspiring effect on many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess , and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is ca@@ tho@@ lic , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one female gym@@ n@@ ast was an Af@@ ro @-@ American woman .
last year were Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a star@@ tling Olympic winner and was ju@@ bil@@ ant in America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world championships in Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful Gy@@ mas@@ tics routines .
on Thursday Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold at an individual multi @-@ event event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this kind of sport , but that &apos;s not what trainers all over the country look like .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie hit all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to join the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four gym@@ na@@ sts in the team . moreover , this is the last year with Mar@@ ta Kar@@ oly@@ i as trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that gymnas@@ tics is an expensive sport and gym@@ na@@ sts primarily in private gy@@ ms that can be maintained by parents which pay for the training , furnishing , travel , clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the coaches and their gym@@ na@@ sts and families ) . the list can be continued arbitr@@ arily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of these trainers are in wealthy suburbs that can support business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in these clubs the gym@@ na@@ sts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ esh , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started the gymnas@@ tics .
we have to au@@ n countless young girls inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie to provide an affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ reach exercise .
I founded my gym@@ n@@ astic foundation 20 years ago .
at my events , we have offered free and affordable Tur@@ ns in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth ( above all black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymnas@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport .
gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong advantages for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that will make thousands of young girls interested in gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you for motiv@@ ating so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assi@@ sts want to organize more strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistance doctors voted in a vote rejected it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July Hun@@ t plans to forci@@ bly introduce the contract and said that the N@@ HS could be found in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No Man &apos;s land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first assistance doctors are to receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend endar@@ s to improve the care at an ung@@ ast@@ ly time .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Committee of Regi@@ ons , announced last night in a communication with : &quot; assistance physicians have serious concerns about the proposed treaty , in particular that it will heat up the current workforce crisis and treat it to justice to all doctors . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time is running out .
efforts by the BM@@ A to resolve disputes by talks were to take part in the government for reluct@@ ance and sometimes on ear @-@ num@@ bing silence .
this happened in a promise made by Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , raise up and address the worries of resident physicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do this , the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further prepar@@ atory measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in providing coverage to doctors on the strip chain .
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A would like to improve the week of the week for the 5@@ 4,000 assistance doctors who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Chief Executive Officer of the N@@ HS staff , urged the assistance physicians to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prepar@@ atory measures do not reach little , but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , nur@@ ses and their families only worries , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last two months , we talked to the Regi@@ strar of Regi@@ ons and responded positively to concerns about tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that continued positive engagement with other important topics - such as deployment , flexibility in training courses , training courses , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers , Health Education England and the Ministry of Health in respect to the agreement with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 per day drug after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medication is administered for 12 months following a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke or a further heart attack .
the N@@ HS Regul@@ atory Authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS Regul@@ atory Authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
about 140@@ ,000 people every year suffer a heart attack and a quarter of it suffer from a further heart attack or a stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls which form plaque .
when the floor@@ covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that c@@ logged blood flow to the heart and thereby cause a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots trigger , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
individuals who have had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is manufactured by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name of Bri@@ li@@ que reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more unlikely .
the draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or a stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have had a heart attack .
by a preliminary recommendation by T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness Culture makes electoral fraud in Muslim lands
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed from office last year for the release of a government report for corruption
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim congreg@@ ations is know@@ ingly ignored , as a devastating government report today disclosed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally acc@@ uses police , election observers and town halls to ignore evidence of electoral fraud as a result of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violations of eth@@ ni@@ city and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Minister for Integration and Local Government , who is now an anti @-@ corruption coalition , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set shut @-@ off tapes outside of electoral cabinets to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should have an ID to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment a vot@@ er has to name his name and address .
the report proposes applying non @-@ removable ink to a person &apos;s finger if they give up their vote to prevent someone from selecting twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
he demands that the press should have more access to church documents and decisions of not official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud but also to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud that comes with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s electoral sc@@ and@@ als in east London .
last year , a special court ruled that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
the Court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal fashion &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bias charges .
Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the Muslim duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either du@@ bi@@ ous or the result of an imitation where one person chooses to be someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of dec@@ eit throughout the country .
he expressed himself in particular alar@@ ming on the frau@@ dul@@ ent mail @-@ election - with the older members of the Muslim community put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the leading of ID cards to prove identity
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as evidence has been indicated that pressure has been exercised on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , in order to elect according to the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pakistan or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... governmental institutions have know@@ ingly ignored such behavior due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violations of eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said fifty recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists are working on the editing of let@@ ter@@ heads to stop &quot; re@@ aping . &quot;
the report drawn by Ther@@ esa May also requires tough@@ er registration review to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and social fraud purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger once she has given her voice to prevent someone to choose twice .
to carry out systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications to an automatic letter selection .
ban on political activists to process full let@@ ter@@ heads and envel@@ opes of let@@ ter@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have the authority to set up shut @-@ downs to set up electoral stations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a change in the law that facilitates an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation following the 1983 Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 .
prohibition of photograph@@ ing in poll@@ ing stations .
requirement that only English is allowed to be used in the voting stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fying the training to ensure that the staff enforce the rule that voters go alone in the election cabin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let fall , there is no criminal complaint . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral tribunal has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty for a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check boxes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the election registration departments of the Town Hall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Jud@@ gment in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country is a proud heritage as the mother of the parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger and other famous Doppel@@ gänger of Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ lern in Rio
fans of the Olympic Games 2016 in Rio are surprised by the French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot who proved to be an impressive double @-@ cat@@ cher of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ on@@ ik@@ in is by far not the only one to compete in gold fighting athlete who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ ck@@ ering on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic games that have more than a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US crew in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio
apart from being a double @-@ cat@@ cher on the rac@@ et@@ rack , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be .
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he looks incredibly similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself don &apos;t see much simil@@ arity , except for facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good looking guy , so I think it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ a , with her big expressive eyes , is meant to be a double @-@ cat@@ cher for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
one course higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Theatre
another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver med@@ alli@@ st Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova has more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : soccer star Hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others liked the simil@@ arities
theory in space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face @-@ shape and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons covered Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in Tur@@ ning Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , wide smile that resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a pig died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Canadian trans@@ mit@@ ters C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese float , like &quot; Ab@@ bot , &quot; and during the race such as &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought his microphone was switched off when he set his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron .
Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought aboard by the team of comment@@ ators of the C@@ BS in order to give more &quot; colour , &quot; one could say : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , going down as M@@ ief , died like a pig .
thank you for it .
the Chinese float in Ai Yan@@ is , 14 , swa@@ m the second stage of the squ@@ ad@@ ron scale 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor ru@@ ck , which made it possible for Canadi@@ ans to fill the gap to China .
viewers across Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shocked by the sound and the language
E@@ mm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Di@@ d the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; died like a pig ? ? ? ? ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not get that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Yan@@ is from China has been described as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard , with many to talk about .
Twitter users didn &apos;t keep back when they heard how in@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald .
you are representing the C@@ BC and Canada and makes all of us look like ra@@ cists . # bes@@ ek@@ elt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; shortly thereafter , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the commentary by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment about a swimming performance was broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC exc@@ used more than 90 times in the people who responded to the Noti@@ ce on Twitter
the comment@@ ator Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for Mac@@ Donald &apos;s name
C@@ BC copied and added to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements have been made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on the show and our audience in the social media .
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on it as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding . By@@ ron is very sorry for what he said .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to excuse me for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ ism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I focused on the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on her as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no contemp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

standing in the middle of the sales area she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out her own stri@@ pe pants and pants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a more dis@@ crete place to do - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like Osk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the pants which you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put her back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she liked nothing , got up and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anyone watching - or thinking about the person who would possibly buy under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how disgu@@ sting to think that someone would take under@@ pants with home that had a different person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident took place on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Davi@@ dson &apos;s wife added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I witnessed , the staff tries to draw the garments out of sale after it went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of pants and find out that another woman had them and went out and they didn &apos;t wash them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman for Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that happened on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products in question were pulled out of the sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapons attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we spoke with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you &apos;re approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn your rob@@ ber around the sk@@ ewer .
if you approach you from behind , you should turn around as first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and move out of the firing line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and shoulder to face it with your free el@@ bow .
strike it with the knee in the l@@ ath and twist , while the attack@@ er cl@@ ings in front of pain , the weapon out of his hands . strike him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him .
with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the firing line , grab the weapon and twist it , so that the attack@@ er cannot shoot .
at the same time , shift the weight onto the weapon and hit the attack@@ er on the chest , then twist the weapon out of his grip , before moving backwards and directing the weapon to it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it performs in Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that a rob@@ ber@@ y is the saf@@ est to hand over your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right sha@@ kes his tongue for a guide to the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British travel@@ er with@@ drew his immune system and saus@@ age @-@ lex of a serious test by le@@ vi@@ ing some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k crashed his train on a euro note , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a flush of a toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before le@@ aking each object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he will get involved .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight .
the thought to lick the flush of a toilet that was used by thousands of others may be totally revol@@ ting , but in fact , there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe Mr. W@@ right talked to doctors and healthcare professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health .
fortunately , nothing left what he li@@ cked out , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth .
Mr. W@@ right became known to test the resistance of his bow@@ el by travelling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things .
from public money at railway stations to pur@@ ging of toilets , the task definitely put its immune system under a test
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child , I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film , he was able to meet his reputation in any case .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his sample painting showed a lumin@@ ometer count of more than 4000 units .
in comparison , the lumin@@ ometric speed of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick off after her lumin@@ ance speed was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of milk products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst that I have seen in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing cleaner than that !
I will not lick here because it is disgu@@ sting inside .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended with saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of just talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a greater context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me tell you - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he liked some of the things I told him to lick , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick them and others , in which this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty gad@@ gets on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of respon@@ dents associate lac@@ tic acid bacteria , in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and gut , and 58 percent said they use at least occasional products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria added .
as@@ o@@ cial family destroyed before del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left their apartment after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ vation with a loss of £ 50,000 because it had terr@@ orized its neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , employees of the housing cooperative found their property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls had opened holes , wooden plan@@ ks were pil@@ ed up , rub@@ b@@ ish was disper@@ sed on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was lubri@@ cated to the walls .
the family were res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer to be repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in that way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider , as this property is thought to be regarded as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted on street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive scre@@ aming , stri@@ fe and flight .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which will possibly be torn down , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
the property in which drugs were used in the past were pil@@ ed up by wooden plan@@ ks .
neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and had to call the police on a regular basis
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing o@@ gi@@ erte she and her partner forci@@ bly from the property this week after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ vation was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their life was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did not care for anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; we couldn &apos;t sleep this morning . &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that !
now that they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have had the family to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years .
rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down on the over@@ grown site of the community house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the les@@ see agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family , as a del@@ o@@ gi@@ vation is always the final step that Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing takes into account . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be terri@@ bly mit@@ ed .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have given us the information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation on the floor .
workers of the house management will now have to clean the garbage mountains that surround the house
in 2014 police launched a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine of money after having found herself guilty of the possession of a drug of class B in commercial intent .
she claimed that money was a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
having been without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many room walls of the house were gra@@ ffiti .
the police say they will deleg@@ ate rent@@ ers who don &apos;t stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row of the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall told that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ vation is a clear warning to the other tenants who don &apos;t stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is about those who think they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ ach as well as those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists panic in Portugal after a ti@@ rel@@ ing military jet flies over the beach
sun@@ ba@@ thers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a portu@@ gal P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on Air Force took an incredible dive
the air forces stated that it was on a training flight , but insisted that there was no security risk .
this was the moment when scared tourists began to panic after a ti@@ rel@@ ing jet crashed over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew in close proximity to the sun@@ ba@@ thers on the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the tourists jumped up when they naturally started to worry about the noise of the nozzle engines without first seeing what was coming to them through the clouds .
the incident took place yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; twice really flew past very deeply and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at Av@@ eiro &apos;s beach were terri@@ fied when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fis@@ her boats in front of the coast and to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them .
the speaker said that due to poor visibility there was a little bit deeper than usual due to poor visibility , but the air forces persist@@ ently insisted that safety was not at all at risk .
land fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland during this summer , where four people were killed on Madeira Island .
the Portuguese air@@ strikes today indicate that the pilot had to fly so low because of the conditions - heavy fog and smoke smoke - which restricted his view .
the aircraft was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : the Bar@@ ca with a worry about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona fights on Sunday for the first step to the first title win in the new football season .
the Catal@@ ans compete against FC Sevilla in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup , the re@@ play goes three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ W@@ inners must refrain from participating in the power trade with the defeated Cup@@ fin@@ alist and reign@@ ing Europa League Champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who comp@@ etes with Brazil the Olympic Football Tournam@@ ent .
in addition , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen is also missing .
the German suffered a change of lig@@ aments in the knee in the training , which clari@@ fied the admission question at Bar@@ ca at least for the time being in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chi@@ lean International and T@@ er St@@ egen were competing in Barcelona for two years now as number one .
in this respect , coach Luis En@@ rique decided to make a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the League , but T@@ er St@@ egen holds the lead in most other applications .
before the first mandatory game of the new season , the Spanish master doubts about the fitness status of the team , who was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test match from Liverpool at 0 : 4 .
even at 3 : 2 in Pro@@ s@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. did not really know how to convince .
Sev@@ ille , in turn , has to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat after length@@ ening in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and aims at the second triumph at the Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana .
with so far Barcelona is the record winner in this competition .
Ma Long in its own league to table tennis @-@ gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old won his comp@@ atri@@ ot and defending champion Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the world ranking first took the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with successes at WM , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and even Olympia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it as expected in the final game and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row Chinese would pick the single title in the sign of the five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top of the top Olympics was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sets and in time @-@ outs they had no coaches with them .
they had withdrawn to the tri@@ bun@@ e and left their prot@@ é@@ g@@ és on a fair competition on their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have played the matches here for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang said sharply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists were pos@@ ing with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expectedly one @-@ sided .
Ma had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year old opponent only in the first set .
after that he set the pace on the record and left Z@@ hang from there on only a total of 13 points .
the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected ro@@ using match .
however , there were nonetheless plenty of stunning ball changes to be seen .
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the game of bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als against the European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ bat@@ ov , the White @-@ White had drawn up a rival@@ ry of ri@@ bs , after which he was in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to be satisfied with sheet metal .
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) have inci@@ dentally become a similarly high table tennis @-@ old Olympia @-@ Vi@@ erte .
Donald Tr@@ ump appro@@ ves &quot; form@@ id@@ able problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Republi@@ cans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative states lose their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has now short@@ com@@ ings of his election campaign in the former republi@@ can strongh@@ old of U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ track and self @-@ assured Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire vo@@ iced something like concerns about how correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals in his own Republi@@ can camp out of the race , doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump to evangel@@ ical Christians , who asked him for support in important states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilty were false reports of his candid@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media campaign .
w@@ ack@@ le republi@@ can strongh@@ olds
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Republi@@ cans .
according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ US from June , Tr@@ ump and his competitor were equal to the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutes see tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered .
in an interview by the CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump replied to the question how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and whether afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t do anything other than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it was not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that was okay , &quot; Tr@@ ump further said .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Tr@@ ump party is said to have threatened to strike mon@@ ies to support its election campaign , it should not be able to present a better survey .
instead , it is hoped that the Republi@@ cans will have stronger support for the Congress .
Olympia : triple sc@@ am at the dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to establish a disciplinary committee .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympics .
after an attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village Kenya sent a trainer home .
the International Olympic Committee announced to immediately set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan member informed that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village , gave a urine sample under the name of the 800 meter runner F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ ich .
this was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF World Association has requested the IO@@ C for information on the case to ex@@ ert its own investigations , and announced an IA@@ AF spokesman .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and subsequent measures taken by the IO@@ C , IA@@ AF will evaluate a rating , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and released himself as F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ i , released and signed the rehear@@ sal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Kenya &apos;s chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete , who stood on the list for the training control of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
in 2015 , F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ i had become more than 800 meters in the Beijing World Championship .
four days before , Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics head leader Michael Rot@@ ich was withdrawn from the Rio games .
he is said to have informed athletes of his country about upcoming dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was reported to have been arrested at his return to the Nairobi airport .
Kenya has long been under special monitoring in the IO@@ C following numerous dop@@ ing contracts since a long period of time .
during the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing destination checks taken by the IO@@ C before the Rio games , it was unusual to point out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency had exer@@ ted much pressure on the African country before the summer Olympics in Brazil , creating an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the Olympics began .
as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya participated in the list of countries whose dop@@ ing fight con@@ forms with the rules of the WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a great runner nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports of the ARD , alle@@ gations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a significant mentality of sports bet@@ ting .
the IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently asked for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had employed in Russian athle@@ tics .
it could be proven that in this kind of sport it was thought @-@ wide and systematically thought @-@ up .
Russia &apos;s athletes were ther@@ eu@@ pon excluded from the summer games .
&quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Shakespeare &apos;s year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic pair of lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the help of a surprising Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ steins master@@ pieces .
the artistic director Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the classical music temple and fulfilled the role of Mary as a youth room .
in the orchestra pit Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ ms .
we always say that it is very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and their melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have amber music in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary .
she re@@ members her love with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Maria always fascinated me .
first , because it is exceptional musi@@ cally !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so she is wise , naturally also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately .
&quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character , which I have as a Roman , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor for us to work with her .
it is an enormously generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a happy approach to life , which is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly topical : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ an people went to New York , and the New Yor@@ kers didn &apos;t want them .
they are the same themes , and they are as meaningful today as they were back then .
59 years later the piece is still relevant .
London School Girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British ma@@ ids who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago her family learned about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , reported I@@ TV news on Thursday .
Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had planned to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good thing there is - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - stopping people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other ma@@ ids from the east of London went on an aircraft toward Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain as candidates for the Supreme Court in the case of electoral victory in Gar@@ land
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presi@@ dency candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Republi@@ cans in the Senate have blocked the country &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the late judge at the Supreme Court in Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain amount of certainty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not yet talked with Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he would spec@@ ulate .
he pra@@ ises Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not care for un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the supreme judge for the US Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Republi@@ cans blocked the Gar@@ lands Nom@@ ination , be lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also noted Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
Tre@@ ats wants neck calendar for &quot; Women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine co @-@ operates with photographer David Bel@@ le@@ eches in order to publish a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked human beings , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazin of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys emphasizes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he thinks there is the calendar too .
&quot; we must return to the representation of timeless and classical nu@@ dity where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release on the release of the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally on open Cast@@ ing calls in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community reck@@ ons with mass ev@@ asion
&quot; whoever doesn &apos;t fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
in the short term , the Kur@@ ds congregation in Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of protective seekers fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; believed by the chairman of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the harsh treatment of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term , with some hundred thousand prot@@ ectors from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Prime Minister Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government has already covered Kurdish strongh@@ olds with criminal charges a few months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds are fle@@ eing inside Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the failed put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks would arise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to start anew in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that assimil@@ ates refugees itself produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chairman of the association lam@@ ented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
in this way , Erdo@@ gan is hoping to increase the pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been exter@@ minated or driven over the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chairman of the association called for the Federal Government to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positioned as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in Germany a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics occurred . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last few months I feel no longer safe in Germany .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len @-@ trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever doesn &apos;t fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alist and secular , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as reported by the Federal Ministry of Justice calling on numbers of the Federal Ministry of Justice , the Turks set up the largest group of asylum holders recognised in Germany because of political persecution .
as of June 30 , this was 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and almost 29 per cent of all as eligible for asylum ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , there are not those who are fle@@ eing from war , poverty or lack of prospects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Basic Law , asylum enti@@ t@@ lements are exclusively politically , i.e. from government side , individually persecuted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals do not get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
they have understood Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
in 2021 the country election will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
because stupid as up to now it is not : summer holidays , heat and country weather combat - that bites .
the locals , who are to be persu@@ aded by the election fighters , are on holiday .
the most holi@@ day@@ makers in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so don &apos;t choose the Land@@ tag .
there are practical problems : hel@@ pers who hang up posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , spread fl@@ yers , and counting out voices only ar@@ du@@ ously .
until 4 September 2016 , the poll@@ ing and final day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania has to pass the election campaign just under the people .
the hot phase when you can tell it at all has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear for his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in poll@@ s .
exciting is how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D will cut off and what remains at the end of coalition dust .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive campaign for election , one sees from his big posters .
he travels across the country , distri@@ butes roses and chat@@ ting a little with the people , just as his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also did .
otherwise , sailors have cold feet and chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel can blame the Af@@ D &apos;s blossom@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has accelerated the rise of right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U , with its leading candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced what it is like to make an election campaign at the wrong time .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has invited her to major documents ; Merkel Bun@@ dest@@ ag@@ sw@@ ahl@@ kreis is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently compla@@ ined to the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
otherwise , the north @-@ east CD@@ U largely wai@@ ves the usual campaign conditions on market@@ places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kok@@ ert , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union has also noted that on the land it crum@@ bles the base that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are doing it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly exists in the expan@@ ses of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the advice of the CD@@ U election campaig@@ ner Kok@@ ert to his comrades is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , golden weddings , every birthday party has to be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because there is a lot in the game , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD a particularly committed campaign .
in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats last 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just in front of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the vote in 2011 , the SPD won still 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , the small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , are likely to make the leap into the Land@@ tag .
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday @-@ need and mainly transfer their campaign to the Internet .
&quot; online election campaigns , &quot; it calls the president Claudia Mu@@ eller .
otherwise , green campaig@@ ners embar@@ k on a search for local voters on the vac@@ ation@@ ers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ ates with a hous@@ ebo@@ at by the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ bur@@ gian lakes and also finds it beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 rehabilitation : restaurants suffer from blocking
at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabili@@ t@@ ated there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end up at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning , praise is everywhere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did everything pretty sha@@ ky , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the Jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no delay as well .
the construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything should be finished .
there will also be a commen@@ dation of those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to the establishment of accommodation .
since the construction site was moved south on Monday and the closure of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and thus also the connection to Rot@@ tenburg has been restored , the traffic situation within the town has eased .
the citizens can now travel on both sides by O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ev@@ asive traffic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the place seems to go back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there were some considerable complaints , &quot; says the deputy head manager Florian King responsible for the transport @-@ related management of the refur@@ bish@@ ment .
the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ strasse , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eks were looking for and more familiar to their na@@ vi than the sign@@ posting .
what caused some trucks to become fra@@ yed in residential areas .
as the speed limits were not met , the municipality demanded an increase in the vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were significant exceed@@ ances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made herself spot on site . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have been bra@@ ked .
the fastest speed was 77 hours per hour in the pace @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has moved on , however , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that the road to customers from Rot@@ tenburg is now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to revenue break@@ through@@ s leads everyone to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus produced for other companies , for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at most slight drop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the running search is missing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most strongly captured are the restaurants along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , former crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential threatening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
we must be happy about every Euro turnover .
at the same time , the sales impact is much higher than 50 percent . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the street refur@@ bish@@ ment was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrown back two years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of his employees have to be fired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been released , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , President of the president Jörg Schmidt responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , if there could be a financial compensation , otherwise the restaurant benefits from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages inherent in the rehabilitation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where something more generous has been handled .
with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is confident that his restaurant will continue to exist .
finally , the family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history .
it can be understood that other regular guests are now less frequently passing by because of the complicated traffic guidance .
if you can &apos;t go here , it is also somewhere else beautiful .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his stem cells return to the end of the re@@ development work .
despite the crisis with BSE and avi@@ an influenza , G@@ öh@@ ner sees the effects of the B 27 construction on his customers for the biggest crisis , which his restaurant has experienced in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , this is already brutal .
in the name of the fight against terrorism , it is constantly bol@@ ted to laws .
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick security package .
but what does a tolerance of tolerance have to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the verse @-@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t over@@ take anyone .
other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also took part in this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , as Minister of the Interior , he was based on results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gave a little time to pass before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some are already known , announced , announced : that a new security agency should take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations on air passenger data and weapons law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is starting a second attempt for proposals that have not been done with the SPD so far : he wants sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ cks off jihadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult spots for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he nevertheless believes this to be reasonable and also doesn &apos;t demand anything that has no chances in the coalition partner anyway .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also presents a few new ideas .
they are in part : he plans rapid procedures for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ain@@ ing people from deportation .
refugees who are targeted at the country should check their smartphones and open social media accounts for a security check .
in the case of toler@@ ances for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to put some worse points than to date - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of these are politically and legally un@@ cles .
some also have an un@@ finished effect and leave questions un@@ answered .
and at some points - in the im@@ balance of patient for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the subjects refugees and terror .
but it cannot be argued that the assass@@ inations of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in view of the high number of refugees , many people were worried about safety .
and things that deeply devoted people could not be cl@@ ung out even during election days .
inner security has moved enormously .
first the ki@@ cks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are electoral campaigns .
on the subject of internal security , the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly turning into position .
in the past few days , between the two parties went high .
only a gri@@ ev@@ ous argument about the facilities of the Federal Police , then via a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the resort chiefs also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a return from the dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also pain@@ stak@@ es here to reconci@@ le conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
he doesn &apos;t hold anything from a passing away from the double @-@ pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have satisfied the discussion in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to re@@ open it is not useful .
and with a ban on bur@@ ka , he has constitutional obj@@ ections .
whether its own package is constitutional in all corners and if it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it still has to show itself .
there is a lot of things in there , which could cause controversy .
but the SPD is also trying to profile itself on the issue of inner security .
&quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot;
even Volkswagen got off lightly .
despite the diesel engine , the distribution numbers are increasing worldwide .
but it doesn &apos;t work in all markets .
in the recall action , there is vor@@ tex around a term .
Volkswagen starts out@@ pac@@ ing deliveries to the second half of the year .
in spite of its many brands and well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can continue to show a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July , VW &apos;s core brand , above all in Western Europe , weak@@ ens the overall sales , as reported in the Da@@ x company .
in July , the VW brand sold 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars around the world to 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s month .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the home market of Germany the deliveries declined by almost a sixth .
sales director Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann pushed the weaker figures from July , above all , to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there has been a reluct@@ ance to buy back in some core markets through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote for exit from the EU was also bur@@ dened by a spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the USA , where the flu@@ e @-@ gas industry first escal@@ ated , a minus is also available .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the mainly affected family brand of Nieder@@ sachsen has got off lightly in any case due to the diesel scandal : after the first seven months , only a drop of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
group sales director Fred Kap@@ pler was able to present a sales figure from January to July .
at this time , Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide , 5,@@ 90@@ 4 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ating gas testing with a software .
in Germany alone VW calls about 2.5 million vehicles for retro@@ fitting into the workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars did not have any negative effects .
after converting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the conversion , the car manufacturer stipul@@ ates a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate but does not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was stated on Friday in company circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason are legal refin@@ ements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen is now granting its German customers a guarantee for equipped diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Monday , this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Aviation Ministry .
from the Ministry of Transport it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has to fulfil the obligations of my investigation commission and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; devi@@ ations from this will not be accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has taken the guarantee that , after retro@@ fitting , fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance will not take place , and all vehicle values will remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was called in corporate circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the wide term &quot; warranty &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers , for example , come to a workshop half a year after retro@@ fitting - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the interest of customers it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust @-@ scandal , there is an uncertainty about possible warranty claims as it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund on T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see calls for rich austerity in the future - a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , bank manager Josef Paul said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Federal Association of German banks talks about an individual case and does not see it as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers don &apos;t have to worry about paying for their austerity measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
deposit money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , it will have to pay its 0.4 percent penalty interest rate .
this fee requires Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund returns from September of private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros to sight deposit accounts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100,000 Euros are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 euros in the future will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; Paul said .
he had been paying 40 million euros for some time , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are in the central bank account with me and cause 0.4 percent of the costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot deposit for every million 4000 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle , the cost is now higher .
to leave cash in the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank &apos;s saf@@ es would be too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already seen four attacks , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! , &quot; said the Bank Chief .
most customers would have understanding and changed to other types of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association Bayern explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy causes considerable costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to bear alone is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically not possible economically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their bank account fees , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thurin@@ gian People and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 made head@@ lines with pen@@ alties for deposits from three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , managing director of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits , and the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is far too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said that at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele that is out@@ fitted by fortune . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she jumps for free . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , the G@@ mund cooperative bank has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ ta@@ ch @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
famous actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cooperative association of Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is currently not known to other banks that charge a lev@@ y for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ woman Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the president of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold of going into the negative towards private customers is very , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to competition .
customers in Germany will not enjoy this in their width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
l@@ one middle @-@ aged men love records .
before you come to the comment section , to sa@@ vor it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym of non @-@ Al@@ le@@ S@@ sam@@ en@@ men middle @-@ aged with rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the multip@@ lied re@@ formation of vinyl records is not due to a boom in m@@ illenni@@ als who want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all fores@@ ight at the age of 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
there is also no hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older records retain their emotions rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog was a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and I &apos;m wild before I stop , hold my hands and say something whis@@ per like : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty stores .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to turn the camera off for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to assess their age and minds through observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , to whom I am of Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged males ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight middle @-@ aged males , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours .
is he a collector , I wonder ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I appreciate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have approx . 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
these records , pictured above ( he sent me the sn@@ apshot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress the walls of his sitting room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford than they appeared and buy items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things in which I was probably something too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets on the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media team , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are forced to buy their old records .
from the conversations that I have led , people usually get rid of their collection so as to get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like ph@@ onica to see that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers accepted the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers , from objects that watch joyful youth memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s like a collector so I think it &apos;s like that among many people .
it is an easy way to get involved spiritually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee inf@@ used from a stack of records . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey conducted by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet heard of it .
the survey found out that 41 % have a record player they never use while 7 % of those who buy a record have no record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I smoo@@ then through a pile of bos@@ sa nov@@ a comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone came here only recently and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead Schall@@ platte , so that I can put them on the shelf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product @-@ centered , less music @-@ grade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who come in only slowly .
F@@ op@@ p , which has dedicated the records almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience when I go in .
there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age children and middle @-@ aged women .
even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest syn@@ thesizer and sex packed pop instead of experimental jazz from the speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but na@@ iling psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to find when standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the shop for several minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale .
it rather makes a window bum@@ per as a wholesale purchase .
it doesn &apos;t deserve a lot , so collecting plates is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives off with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I am giving the impression of mu@@ stering the jeans pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls group@@ ing around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are considering buying a crossover record player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of records by Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate art &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there &apos;s nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is also the one most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
even though my research showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors , who exist in reality , record shops and online forums , are not considered .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they don &apos;t spend their Thursday morning with the bum@@ ble@@ bees around Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets through sheets , while they steer clear of the star@@ tling view of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false present@@ er who worries about the shoulders of uns@@ us@@ p@@ ecting middle @-@ aged men .

French court rejected offer on demoli@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary stores and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live .
during a trial this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to submit 72 temporary contracts in which persons within the camp sell goods , cigar@@ ettes and energy drinks , sell , offer hair@@ dres@@ sers or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture has argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which contain a fire and san@@ ity risk .
humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also assumed that temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people conducting the 72 temporary operations , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer peaceful meetings between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the ra@@ inf@@ all was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is non @-@ profit @-@ serving and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on the hundreds of needy , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 170@@ ,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian it was said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be a disaster for these children , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people in the jungle in the jungle has increased to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep increase of newcom@@ ers over the summer .
despite the Olympic disappointment : Martin remains a warri@@ or
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance in the Olympic Games , cycli@@ st Tony Martin will not be able to get it done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I keep looking forward to the World Cup , remain confident and fight further , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 31 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he doesn &apos;t have an explanation for his mis@@ er@@ ably twel@@ fth place at the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honestly don &apos;t think it &apos;s hard to comment on driving yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyze calm@@ ly what reasons have led to the de@@ bac@@ le .
at the time of the World Cup in Qatar in October , Martin really wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything that we have changed lately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also counts my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the triple time @-@ driving world champion , who had lost on Wednesday at 5@@ 4.5 km more than three minutes on Olympic champion Fab@@ ian C@@ anc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Microsoft did not share how much money flows for the tak@@ eover .
Be@@ am started his offer only in January and has more than 100,000 users .
you can watch others while playing , but also intervene .
for example , they can give players up missions and equi@@ p enemies as well as provide equipment .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation speed meas@@ urer : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash units will be tested , which should be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or to rehabili@@ t@@ ating bridges with temporary tem@@ pl@@ ating there is often no necessary infrastructure in order to provide a stationary flash for compliance with speed limit .
a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days for un@@ interrupted measurement operation , the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem .
laser measurement technology allows all vehicles to be collected across multiple tracks at the same time .
variable speed limits and drive @-@ through b@@ ans by time , travel stripes and vehicle class can also be monitored .
the trailer can be moved in a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art condition according to the manufacturer , with each car with trailer hit@@ ch .
so that it is not easily st@@ owed , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way also sweat @-@ proof outer shell disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the lightning against v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to the specifications of Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also flash with the new technology : recently France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
UK takes silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold picks up
the impressive performance of Britain in the 7 @-@ year Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were defeated at the De@@ odor@@ o Stadium in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 .
Fi@@ ji granted a master class in handling , side step@@ pes , cr@@ ut@@ ches , line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympi@@ am@@ e@@ da@@ ille of any color .
the defeat was missed by the not too bad tro@@ phy of the silver medal - Great Britain on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the obvious defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
but regardless of that , Fi@@ ji would have hit a 15 @-@ man team in the form of this form .
it might be a con@@ sol@@ ation for UK - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a Brit@@ on tomorrow will have a gold medal hanging around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , former head coach for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , she lost each match at Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens under R@@ yan .
here they lost only one .
this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began to wonder and let the attacks of G@@ Bs jump out of fun .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. as if they were running in running buses . the World Series winners moved 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au moved in the corner .
with four minutes of playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another offensive from the right corner he converted .
12 @-@ 0 and GB have hardly touched the ball .
a terri@@ fying h@@ ack of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but Fi@@ ji only stopped .
in the seventh minute , Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua posted a touch down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re @-@ p@@ fi@@ ff and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ sured by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med to the line to make a fool .
the transformation took a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning .
that is how it is .
GB performed fundamental changes in half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went long in favour of the South Sea sul@@ fit@@ ters , whose fans sang , flags swa@@ yed and danced on the tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame did the finishing touch with another attempt in the last seconds .
the whi@@ stle sounded , the fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced and GB cr@@ un@@ ced into the tur@@ f .
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a scar@@ ce semi @-@ final match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown moved forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a score among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team ensured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer for a rowing victory
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ eric gold than with these games and that wants to be called .
from the first ru@@ dder up to the last , 220 hard dri@@ vet@@ rain that goes into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional importance in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
there were three voices in the boat even if there were only the two of them sitting at the helm . the echo of the coach Robin Williams was all present when they followed the second Olympic gold in two without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British Sports , who set such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolute , at least their 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ beaten work , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant female athletes who gli@@ de across the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the nature of triumph@@ al .
behind every gold in the herd is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to incre@@ mental progress that makes the difference and there was no one of the aids as the coach who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he ris@@ ked .
I had bladder cancer that was oper@@ able and that did .
if you don &apos;t do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been quite a bad situation .
it changes slightly the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he was able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , in the event that under such circumstances it is the right term .
I needed money , so I had to go better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it even bigger .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve @-@ wra@@ cking morning doing something more than usual and tried to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ anning , who was a Captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . this is perhaps a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much this means , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we wouldn &apos;t be anybody , so a massive thank you to him . he &apos;s the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for exercising or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 metres when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to catch up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much reserve .
we were very trapped at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; remain in the process , remain in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking to make something great .
we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ works today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about their future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV adventure of Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that was my last race .
that would have been too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
exemplary for clarity for 31 years
the managing director of the water @-@ purpose association &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , will reti@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this was the name of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little later , the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian Government appreciated the purpose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this stands Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was a member of the association for 31 years , of which 28 years as managing director .
he was now reti@@ ring at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , annually transports about 150@@ ,000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ berg , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for other towns and communities .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a water@@ shed in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the T@@ wel@@ ve Board in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his duties have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions up to emergency interventions at weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chair@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an outstanding event , it called the commissioning and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , property purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the renovation of the high containers ( 1999 ) , the new acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the renewal of water pipes .

soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko leaves open with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; they must have the courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot;
when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed that she had to die .
but the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago had come forward well and learn now privately in New York , where there are the best therapists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him something two years ago , when I sang Scala in Milan , he re@@ members nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - Man shooting at the partner of life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man fired at his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district of Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 am and mort@@ ally injured her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man himself called us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police @-@ spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rator is on the run , and after him I am publicly punished .
by now , nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1.80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ burned and has a bald .
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
however , it is a couple of years old .
in the meantime , the man has a bald face .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon , the police .
those who see Sven S should call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police are talking about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship act &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rator 1981 .
the police in Lu@@ e@@ beck did not want to give any information about the Ta@@ ther@@ some or the relationship between perpet@@ rator and victim , but she confirmed that a man had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lu@@ e@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special mission command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime scene .
steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed millions of additional costs .
financial burdens that the industry threatened from green electricity production are from the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it remains in the liberation of the Renew@@ able Energy Transi@@ tion in the existing plants for the so @-@ called self @-@ current production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gases from blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry predicted an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , now there is a fundamental agreement with the European Commission following discussions with Com@@ miss@@ ariat Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only if the generators in the steel works are replaced , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent falls .
but even this is not le@@ vi@@ ed in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the agreement between Germany and the European Commission on its own electricity generation .
in doing so , the status quo of the previous regulation will be largely determined .
the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry is particularly important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign , this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of emissions legislation , climate and employment targets are to be weighed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation continued to ag@@ grav@@ ate when the world &apos;s largest producer of products threw massive steel to the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers repro@@ ach Chinese steel companies with price d@@ umping .
in the course of this spring , the situation has eased a little .
on the one hand , im@@ pregn@@ ated import duties on import steel show effect , on the other hand the economic prospects in China were bri@@ gh@@ tened up .
it is unclear how long lasting the price recovery is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , prices would have stagn@@ ated .
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
in doing so , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works .
around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , despite rising prices and increasing orders , German steel manufacturers remain cau@@ tious .
at 3.4 million tonnes , they produced six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , as the Steel Association announced on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the manufactured number went back to the second consecutive month .
since the beginning of the year , production has been two percent lower than the previous year &apos;s figure .
thanks to an improved order situation , the association expects a rising output in the coming months .
community , spirit , health : singing is good for sen@@ iors
the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp all her life : as a young girl she was in school choir , in the Leh@@ ra@@ mt university she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singing moves me emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more lively , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and her spirit .
because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior league .
most sen@@ iors chant in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , H@@ ac@@ kler describes .
through regular interaction , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaking and organizing , to be able to rely on others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for doing so , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demand their lungs get out of the brush even in everyday life .
even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an ideal hobby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singing often has a very special effect on older people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ursula L@@ enz from the federal labour community of senior citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the older generations , common singing had a much higher priority , it was part of everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , it explains .
L@@ enz frequently ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people awak@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
by song lyrics and especially melodies , people who have dementia are de@@ voting themselves to long @-@ lying events .
while singing the head requires a special performance , L@@ enz explains .
at the same time concentrate on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - that &apos;s a great cognitive challenge .
just elderly people who live on their own are doing so not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition gained by singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise for something long for something , I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens .
there are plenty of good reasons to start singing .
if you want to try out a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who can hear when a tone goes wrong ?
in search of the right offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces sings in a senior choir , you can easily join .
many cities also offer over@@ views over the cho@@ irs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leader .
you can find many old sen@@ iors over the Internet .
if you do not have access to the Internet , your family , friends or neighbors can ask for help in the internet research .
anyone who wants to sing should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for any age .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than han@@ go@@ vers on the scre@@ ams of the young
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover which effect the calls of kit@@ tens on adult animals has .
to its surprise the mi@@ ch@@ ment also did not let the males cold - however they always beha@@ ved in contrast to the females always the same .
female cats can recognize the degree of arous@@ al of kit@@ tens in the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
they respond ten percent faster to sounds of kit@@ tens , which are in great need , as scientists have found out by the veter@@ inary surgeon and the Hannover Medical School ( M@@ H@@ H ) .
males also react to the calls of kit@@ tens - but always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ ch@@ iness of less and strongly arous@@ ed kit@@ tens for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the M@@ H@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is the author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already discovered that the duration and pitch of the cat scre@@ ams vary with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness .
a total of nine adult males and eight female males were observed from the M@@ H@@ H animal hus@@ band@@ ry .
they were played for a rep@@ o of small children who were taken out of the throwing box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand they were confronted with scre@@ ams of stronger arous@@ ed kit@@ tens , which were raised in addition .
despite the small sample , the researchers keep their results convincing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females , even those who had not had their own offspring , responded to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they swi@@ vel more quickly to the driver , when this calls of the very excited kit@@ tens played off .
this ability may be inn@@ ate or develop with sexual maturity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men to baby sounds .
some studies showed that women were more sensitive to babies , whether they were mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski resorts to Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued against the former foot@@ b@@ aller Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r in Turkey .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt in Turkey an important football game takes place again .
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ bishops between Bes@@ ik@@ tas and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul the official line is un@@ equi@@ vocal : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
even when the state of emergency was handed down after the coup attempt in July , the government failed to im@@ pe@@ de the everyday life of normal citizens .
but this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the Movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len which is responsible for the coup attempt .
in doing so , it is also not done before football .
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r earlier .
according to this , the South Coast who is now living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ kis@@ r is said to be the follow@@ er of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency suspended for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact , the life of most Turks has virtually no effect on the life of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the night @-@ time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdoğan an end on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like the whole country , sport is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the &quot; Bes@@ ik@@ tas &quot; club do not belong to the president &apos;s friends traditionally .
but what unites the groove of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ters .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ cal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be especially again to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cologne presented his sporty value in the past season : with 17 goals and nine models in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as the Top@@ sc@@ orer of his club .
in the final match against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory record .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the Pre @-@ Round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depart early in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g it only reached rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; we &apos;ve done that and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski said .
for Master B@@ ik@@ tas the year of the game was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez who laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 rounds of the season as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ cher King .
this is also the reason why the fans hope to continue on the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AC Florence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under contract signed and passed on to Bes@@ ik@@ tas after the coup attempt to not return to the country after his European holiday due to the political situation in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just has to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club boss F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man cited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to do this , however , the Stür@@ mer would have to be willing to ren@@ ounce about one @-@ third of his € 7.5 million annual salary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes have med@@ als in the Olympic Games in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa may not start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted Ath@@ le@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight for med@@ als in Rio .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ line at the Olympic Games in Rio .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who had acc@@ using her right before the games after a dop@@ ing lock , was ru@@ th@@ lessly picked up and pro@@ filed at their start ( 100 meters of chest ) .
it was a bizarre scene : she was still in the hall with a set smile and had prov@@ oked her performance .
when she realized that she would not get gold , the audience broke out into a che@@ ering storm .
but there are numerous other sports@@ men who take the lead despite the dop@@ ing past at the Olympic Games in Rio .
here is an overview :
J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100m @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , it is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100m @-@ m @-@ relay / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit down a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after it was proven to take the pain@@ killer Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after having had severe tooth@@ ache after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic champion was tested positively by the banned stimul@@ ant meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic testi@@ fied for the un@@ scheduled use and was closed for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est th@@ rows this year go to the account of the big gold favor@@ i@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time World Champion 400 m , was tested positive in 2010 and had been locked for 21 months .
a remedy for penis enlargement was responsible , moist@@ ened mar@@ ching .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m the fastest man in the world .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer Th@@ row , Bel@@ or@@ ussi@@ a ) : hardly an athlete has been recognized as many med@@ als afterwards .
thus T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after he was diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing .
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to give up Olympic Silver 2004 due to ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the European Championship in 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
he also received the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a verdict of the International Sports Court of CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world ranking .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record holder and gold favorite was only tested in May , but may still start in Rio .
evidence of the capture of a banned food supplement was found at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , the barrier of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency WA@@ DA was mild and ran off on July 13 .
bombing terror in Thailand - Austrian wounded - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spo@@ kes@@ man of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Sch@@ nö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she had suffered sc@@ ap@@ shots and had been treated in the hospital but had already left it again .
her home@@ ward journey was planned for the beginning of September .
whether the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket and in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on are also affected Austrian citizens , be unclear for the time being .
in this regard , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , such as rub@@ b@@ ish .
in the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a life area two bombs .
according to police a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dut@@ ch@@ men and three Itali@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friday morning two explo@@ sives went up again , and another man was killed according to the authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ph@@ u@@ ket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured during the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular bathing beach Pat@@ ong .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban employee .
according to the authorities , the explosive device had gone into the air in a flower patch in front of the territory of the coastal police .
finally , there were several det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast , as well as in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast several wounded .
it was said that there was a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings carry the same manuscript , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ am@@ av@@ ee , Friday morning before journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that this is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express possible motives - but probably the acts of Muslim rebels .
in the attacks , Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist revolt or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokesman in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary , it is assumed that the bombs were put down by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
in recent days , the authorities have kept secret information about imminent attacks in the south of the country , but they were not informed of the exact time and places .
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
the police rans@@ ack@@ ed their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings , airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment quarters .
in Thailand , there are repeat@@ ed@@ ely smaller bombing attacks , but mostly they do not direct itself against tourists .
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace built over the years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the resulting bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly recommends to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and the surrounding area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there will not be any necessary journeys to these provinces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military considerable influence over the coming years .
Jun@@ ta Chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos , while the country turned towards stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody uph@@ eav@@ al , re@@ affir@@ med itself to have led the kingdom to stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok during an attack on a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack in the country &apos;s younger history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is targeted by the Federal Office of Constitutional Affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to several state offices , the constitu@@ tion@@ ists in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; we see evidence of intentions for the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the German Press Agency , Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ yo , of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are being mi@@ stre@@ ated in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we are now watching the movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s identity by est@@ ran@@ gement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional protection in nine provinces - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - already observe the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity bears &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ arten said that his authority was closely aligned with the state offices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups such as the &apos; identity movement &apos; are trying to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Supreme Leader . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts attempt to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with pop music .
the same is true of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an ad@@ orable advertisement for one &apos;s own cause .
the propaganda aims to address people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly suscep@@ tible to attack .
this is dangerous .
recently there have been reports of contacts from the &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states .
he said he had no knowledge .
for the constitutional protection possible contacts of this kind are only relevant starting from a certain point .
it depends on whether the party - in this case - is the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognis@@ able .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the significant increase in ri@@ gh@@ tist crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ arten said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we have seen in recent years that there can be ri@@ gh@@ tist structures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may well be that other right @-@ wing terrorist groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seekers , against refugees or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a nationwide or pan @-@ European control of legal terrorism cannot be identified .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
Ma@@ arten expressed concern that many ass@@ aults were made to the account of people who had not appeared before in the right scene .
this is the wor@@ rying thing .
many of the susp@@ ects of attacks on asylum lod@@ gings have not previously been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other words , many people have committed criminal off@@ ences , who had previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who might have been politically in@@ different , or have voted for example the CD@@ U , the SPD or the left , who have then radi@@ cal@@ ised themselves by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always do the Olympic Games or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly obes@@ e s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia slowly swa@@ m so slowly that at times it was no longer visible in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cli@@ pping was chosen .
in social networks , Hab@@ te subsequently became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his lead with a 48 @-@ second set@@ back and finished the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just athle@@ tic figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why does the 24 @-@ year @-@ old take part in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special status law from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more known .
because most athletes run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something different .
preparation is everything : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media referred to him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ bel of W@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; referring to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity bear &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun of him with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he struck only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 m Fre@@ estyle , played no part .
isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention at the Olympic Games in Sydney in 2000 .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete alone in a run over 100 metres of fre@@ estyle .
f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim eight months before the Olympic Games and never had a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump does not see the im@@ pending election defeat so narrow
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at an election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing to do with the election of the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump is already an alternative video .
he then drove to the holiday .
if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential election in November , it doesn &apos;t matter to him : &quot; ultimately , it will either fold or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the U.S. TV station CN@@ BC .
if it was not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , it was fine , said Tr@@ ump .
so he called US President Barack Obama and the candid@@ acy of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party , more and more resistance was formed .
post In@@ cre@@ ases in Retail with Electric transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of the German Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great .
the post plans to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter as well .
the Group will soon want to start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the post office wants to offer its electric transpor@@ ters also on the free car market as of the coming year .
&quot; we want to go to third parties in the sale , &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday .
the company has been examining for months whether they are to deliver their self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with which letters and par@@ c@@ els are delivered , also to sell to other companies .
post @-@ President Jürgen Ger@@ der said that there will always be inquiries , for example by craftsmen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Bonn @-@ based company will shortly enter the mass production of vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the post @-@ production plant , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and a shift .
Ger@@ der announced that the Group intends to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and deliver a complete change to the environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we change the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter is active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ RP @-@ Management steps down after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the Consumer Research Company Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the res@@ ign@@ ations came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K suggested that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes even more uncertain the longer the success promised by him .
turbul@@ ence at the top of the Nuremberg Market Research Company Gf@@ K : following once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the resignation of the management , the world &apos;s number five is facing a new beginning .
the head of the GF@@ RP board wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , already reti@@ res from the Supervisory Board with effect from September 12 .
as early as September 1 , the management board of the board of directors took over the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , who informed the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he should officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; board speaker &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason for res@@ ign@@ ments , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokesman for the company on Friday did not want to mention details .
it is still unclear who will lead the market research company in future .
on Friday , the shareholders also called on the disappointment of the continued success of the restructuring initiated several years ago .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K peak since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the fruits of restructuring are still not visible after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the recent bad business figures in the Gf@@ K , each shareholder will become rest@@ less at some point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this were the case at BMW , that would also do the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
following set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the company failed to stop its loss of power in the second quarter of 2016 .
at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales were 6.1 percent below the comparable year @-@ earlier quarter .
in relation to the first half of the year , sales declined by 3.4 percent to EUR 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million .
in view of its difficult economic situation , the profit in the second quarter was neg@@ atively affected by its difficult economic situation .
the company &apos;s business valuation tot@@ als of 139 million euros , which had become necessary in the Consumer Experience business segment , weighed down a loss of € 14@@ 8.@@ 2 million .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K generated net income of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ horns in Gra@@ ben : eight injured
in the event of an accident of a coach with 43 sen@@ iors , eight people were injured in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ho@@ n ( Land@@ kreis Aur@@ ich ) on Thursday .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , divided the police .
according to her specifications , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old coach of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to ev@@ ade her specifications , partly on the opposite lane .
the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as reported by a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Wit@@ t@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the bus &apos;s location , people could not leave the bus autonom@@ ously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ gade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and emergency ambul@@ ances came to the accident site on the Landes@@ straße 2 .
the last travellers were brought back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ash@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum by a regular bus .
there they should wait for a spare bus from the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fee per cubic meter wastewater is from October 1 , 2016 for the area of the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sh@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 instead of now 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ tenberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 euros ( up to now 2,@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( up to now 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the waste water fee will be increased again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a clear calculation , the sewage price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , with the approval of the household by the District Office Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was established that under@@ cover for these wastewater facilities .
due to legal basis , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the equipment at a cost @-@ covering basis .
from October 1 , 2016 the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ tenberg will have to go deeper into the wal@@ let .
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as head of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt showed the committee , a new calculation of the fees for the waste water facilities of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and / or under@@ cover from the previous calculation period will also be balanced .
Schmidt explained that the serious cost increases were relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack , which was between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a severe impact .
in addition , wastewater generated in all three systems is slightly declining .
in the rec@@ umbent period of calculations , in all three systems , repairs and repair costs were not least incurred because of their age .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ tenberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p are almost 20 years old .
Schmidt explained that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the wastewater treatment plant in Az@@ endorf .
in the pumping station Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and the first clari@@ fication pond had to be dra@@ ined after nearly 20 years , the sewage slu@@ dge was disposed of and an additional ventilation system had to be installed in order to comply with the water regulations in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; the ongoing maintenance and maintenance costs , which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period , came to these extraordinary expenses . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which are still below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that at the low waste water incident in the three plants , the expenses for operation and maintenance were fully reflected . &quot;
Schmidt , the market municipality of large entertainment costs in the waste water facilities , has been spar@@ ed over the past 20 years .
according to the opinion of stone houses , the situation for the above @-@ mentioned systems will continue to remain prec@@ arious , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ en@@ ba@@ cht@@ al wastewater @-@ purpose association could not be extended by these facilities because these facilities are defici@@ ent facilities .
Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months of inflation

the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .

Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian cartoon critici@@ zed
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired but some observers say it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filtering tool , Sn@@ ap@@ chat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that is already adjacent to the absurd .
you can transform yourself into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein .
the filters are bl@@ unt , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ steps go to the public .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have been critic@@ ised in the past in which they were accused of promoting the app Black@@ face promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week suggested to some users a filter that gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity .
the news and indign@@ ation were dis@@ semin@@ ated on Wednesday , with reports by The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat shared that it would have disabled the feature .
the company ap@@ ologi@@ zed : the filter was intended to pay homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who experienced racism , the filter reminded of hur@@ t@@ ful c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the Ani@@ me comparison .
in an email , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American student whose twe@@ ets were widely used over the photos , wrote that the filter was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and mil@@ dly unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the contrast of a very reluct@@ ant Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filtering effects .
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ proof , but that the yellow face has been pulled into the depreci@@ ating extre@@ m .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration battle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are more different than their older opponents in terms of race - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
when one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats filters produces a picture that is insul@@ ting to a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium , decided to delete her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview she said that she believes that rac@@ ist @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the settings of Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the great part white , only male leadership and finished her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that sn@@ ap@@ chat largely left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures for the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , Sn@@ ap@@ chat declined to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a speaker , the company recently set up a personnel manager focusing on under@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu also said she will close her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that it &apos;s not O.@@ K. &apos; .
military leadership for@@ f@@ eit IS@@ IS intelligence information , re@@ jects Committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when it allowed the actual conditions on the ground , an investigation committee of the Congress announced in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the Committee of Ar@@ med Forces , Secret Service Commit@@ tees and the Military Com@@ miss@@ ar , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their estimates of American efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence information that was typically cli@@ cked off by high @-@ level Cent@@ com Com@@ man@@ ders regularly reported a positive image of U.S. efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual states on site and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; stated Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives .
the management errors in the Cent@@ com range to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there are no direct indications that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts faced pressure from their hierarch@@ ies to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the congress were significantly more positive than the facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , Iraq &apos;s second largest city , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the tops of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to down@@ play the threat posed by IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ cans called on the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigation continues .
in addition , further investigation of the Cent@@ com reports is under way by the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defense .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ com created an over@@ ly restricted process for establishing intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the highest @-@ ranking demo@@ crat in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cor@@ rupted the moral under analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave too little room for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no clu@@ es to the intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ com analysts with regard to a &quot; political opinion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s General In@@ spec@@ tor , who were taken up after complaints by Cent@@ com analysts .
according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokesman , there was a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the congress , while the investigation of the General In@@ spec@@ tor was still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome controversial discussions on these key issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the alle@@ gations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of intermedi@@ ation of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush presented only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insur@@ gency against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker stated that contrary to the government &apos;s statements against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State , no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group would have , as these temporary refin@@ eries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
this knowledge , however , was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com &apos;s former commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature for its exc@@ essively positive assessment of the situation at a hearing in front of the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am not one of the people who keep their doors in memory .
but she knows : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the olymp@@ ic competition and are at the same time in their group with the Brit@@ ons at the first place , who remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first placed place will take a little longer from the strong Dutch , who lead the other group .
however the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex , four years after they landed at the last 12 squares at the last London Games .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and having played a hockey bat for the first time with three years ( her two older sisters played sports at the Dre@@ xel University ) , at the age of 16 she became National player of the United States , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the 2008 Olympics because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , coach of the national team , began to turn things better .
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; B@@ am said .
we did not have the work set in London that we have now .
we have been able to s@@ nat@@ ch the ru@@ dder .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the gate to the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the near area .
India had gone into play without victory in the tournament but the team was surprisingly tough and held the game from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball above the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and kno@@ cked the ball into the goal to get the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the US keeper Jack@@ ie Bri@@ g@@ gs who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
amid the rage of the Olympic Games , the zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro make sense constantly and inevitably , a ra@@ ging relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is handed down from the cross@@ bow to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ athlete .
you can &apos;t switch to television , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour &apos;s conversation in the waiting queue in the coffee shop , without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ esh , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the argument between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s s@@ warm with dimples , could have been among these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising , if he were a swi@@ mmer , gym@@ n@@ ast or even fen@@ cers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic arena .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports , which are not generally recognized : air gun shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast swimming and may it reign for a long time .
but if I should make modest arguments for my particular favorite , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years has been so spar@@ sely perceived that many of them , I had questioned , did not know that it is at all an Olympic sport .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to competition , there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an athlete until 2012 , who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal this year from London .
the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider char@@ me , partly because it sounds more appropriate for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a heredi@@ tary enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ ous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ical tre@@ mor of its never @-@ ending collision - but also the Gra@@ zie of gymnas@@ tics and diving , the two sports it essentially unites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
asp@@ iring champi@@ ons jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling moves ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are assessed according to the official Olympic program according to the execution , degree of difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ectors is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts must go further , faster , up and down in their quest for gold , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes up and down , up and down on the playground .
they not only chase the finish line or the exit wall , but also another ridi@@ culous goal in the tel@@ ev@@ ised broadcast : that of the world or the Olympics .
the purpos@@ eful striving is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even touch a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it &apos;s also what I feel as a bit ti@@ res@@ ome when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the V@@ ector of the Tramp@@ oline Ski@@ p is on top .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces down , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then downward , then eff@@ ort@@ lessly back up .
here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wolves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games .
the qualification and final hours of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block from 14.@@ 00 onwards .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the an@@ gling and the obj@@ ectivity of male athletes - as the male US gym@@ na@@ sts recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his breath @-@ blowing , new fan@@ base .
&quot; one @-@ generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political change in Ethiopia met with the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses testi@@ fied that tens of thousands of prot@@ esters were killed during the clas@@ hes with the police at gun@@ fire .
is Ethiopia right to collapse ?
in the last ten years it has been one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last few months , protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more territories .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was rel@@ ent@@ less .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
videos that are in circulation over the protests , probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security officers strike young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a thorough investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was always difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the Horn of Africa &apos;s Horn of Africa , the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians in order to fight terror threats beyond the region , especially in Somalia . few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
although Ethiopia is anything but an example for democracy , human rights organisations have continued to supp@@ ress the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted and dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or sent to prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options other than prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold with regard to the power of the ruling coalition .
following a widely @-@ critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the Parliament .
at the same time , tensions along the border to Erit@@ rea are rising ; a struggle for this sha@@ ky , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts are concerned that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , which were forced more or less forced in recent years , could exploit the turbul@@ ence and re @-@ arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess are explo@@ ding after years of suffering from the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate through social media because cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and the internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave that they were so prot@@ esting .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who from A@@ thop@@ ia , prosp@@ ered predominantly Christian high@@ lands , in politics and economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas .
but this too changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Veget@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in the areas of the Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fair@@ ably dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray who account for around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi &apos;s death .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was Ethiop@@ ian prime minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years .
he was regarded as a tactical genius , a man who could think around corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to manipul@@ ate opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , Hai@@ le@@ v Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected for relatively imper@@ me@@ able reasons in order to adopt the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia had experienced such an u@@ pro@@ ar was in 2005 , after thousands of votes were prot@@ esting against elections which , according to the analy@@ st , were apparently fu@@ eled by the government and subsequently stolen .
during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even though they were less than in the last months and that time of un@@ rest was over relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , and their meas@@ urable progress in poverty allevi@@ ation .
but obviously , this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal dis@@ g@@ ust of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes on a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , attacked by Tig@@ ray and hatred of the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in social media .
analysts say that the protests are bringing the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , although it recently shared that it closed this base .
while West@@ ern@@ ers clearly want to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declares his claim to Obama that IS was founded &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump , on Friday , was trying to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multiple @-@ repeated asser@@ tion that President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the Islamic State terror group , not serious .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions on the communications capabilities of the Republi@@ cans presidential candidate whether he was able to communicate with the American public clearly and intelli@@ gible .
it also brings along its comrades , who endeav@@ our to take protection during an event@@ ful phase , in its peculiar position , to explain the asser@@ tions which he could not have meant .
after having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump re@@ port@@ edly drew back to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the twe@@ et was the contrast to the previous day , where Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he meant accus@@ ation completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t asked Mr. Tr@@ ump to weak@@ en the statement by rec@@ alling that Mr Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it .
the last storm of criticism en@@ capsul@@ ates Mr. Tr@@ ump , while trying to steer the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling demand .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton were talking to the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
at the end of July he was heavily critic@@ ised when he said that the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s email , but he said later , &quot; Of course , I thought it was sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then post@@ p@@ one as needed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his ways to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans , how they arrive , and then possibly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction exp@@ ires . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in a variety of ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed a more et@@ ched tone as his demand values have gone further .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is published on Friday showed a lead in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is in general trying to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he frequently acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humor .
but while he is intensi@@ fying the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump j@@ okes have brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent advoc@@ ates of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump@@ et &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; gave a great effort to defend the candidate in a CN@@ N interview of Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani asked , therefore , to the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ ump@@ y &apos;s statements asked if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them h@@ ind legs , completely false and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton minist@@ ered as Minister of Foreign Affairs , allowed IS@@ IS to spread out aggres@@ sively under control of the situation in the Middle East .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of hur@@ ting around on each of his words and being pre@@ occupied against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , miserable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television professionals trying to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s excuse as just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
once pushed over the price from the market , Café is back in Green@@ point .
Ver@@ b Cafe was a sor@@ ely café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could pay only cash , which didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi , but for that it served 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices were pushed out of his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front .
soap Cher@@ ie &apos;s business , which Ver@@ b replaced in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people moved it as the last loss in a self @-@ identifying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe C@@ B@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is excluding and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is change , then it &apos;s new invention .
a re@@ vit@@ alized club café opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old coffee shop , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he started working in Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide funds for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els purchased the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ nish@@ ings like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted onions .
there are natural cycles .
the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he noticed a steady flow to old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also pushed out of Willi@@ am@@ sburg by prices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira has been such a customer on a Sunday .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in the past and visited the club regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path .
after the verb was closed , she gave up the coffee for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the club which I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the club in 2003 .
he went there before work and inv@@ ari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came fourth after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal is still getting his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment in the fact that the soap business occupied the old business space .
in fact , the owners of the soap cher@@ ie offered to make a special soap for clubs with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we &apos;re going to respond to their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish people Green@@ wich have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he was planning to leave them soon so that his new neighbors would feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice restaurant wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café expands to an adjacent building .
for many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed at the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his as@@ cen@@ sion to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a gour@@ mets President Roosev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refined delicacies on Fi@@ fth Avenue , such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land Tur@@ tle Sou@@ p .
its menu on this day was somewhat more modest : stuffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Bri@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
Co@@ dy &apos;s last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; acted from Chinese cuisine in the USA , while in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; was told about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from a food perspective .
her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday in Har@@ per , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a re@@ porter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , snow@@ y snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock crash crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a cheese sandwich with olives , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mix ate .
when the re@@ porter ordered ham@@ bur@@ gers , this found the couple suitable for a discussion about the food in the era of the Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little che@@ ap@@ ly that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts as serving them as dinner .
CO@@ E sm@@ iled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and freshly baked p@@ ate served for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shows the ways with which the country was going to be no longer the land of land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans became a central theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e announced , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bread and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , as chefs were able to hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a creamy sauce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper drying fruit .
meat , which was the cent@@ re@@ piece of American cuisine for years , became a rarely served luxury .
strange mix@@ tures were tried because a calorie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had priority over taste or even common sense .
during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , brick was prepared from this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter , too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular additive at lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many home @-@ home recipes .
as never before or since , household econom@@ ists - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the food habits of the country like that .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household politicians &quot; and to meet the challenge of converting P@@ amp@@ e like creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historical delicacies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s response to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake @-@ eating pose , are tasty .
while he publicly lau@@ ded the simple I@@ owa peasant kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke like the million@@ aire man of the world he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was terri@@ bly realistic .
President Roosev@@ elt might have made the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to give an example to his stomach .
as described in the book , the present of a house@@ keeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs. Roosev@@ elt led the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food was disc@@ arded as soon as the country got back on the legs .
the legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food .
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example , how she could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was a real fear of food waste , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she really made people ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind @-@ bag incident .
after the plat@@ ters were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roosev@@ elt ate for lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , adding that it was a usual trick to give modest recipes a chic name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone willingly exchanged a spoon in the t@@ amed , brown gli@@ b@@ bers .
amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad .
CO@@ E took three times a supplement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ er he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything in order to save lives .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a civil defence group who , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60@@ ,000 lives .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives on the game to draw people from sh@@ at@@ tered homes and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civil guard , which shows him during an 11 hour rescue of a baby from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans the shining symbol figure in the horror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as a hero he never saw himself , said according to the picture : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die , I think God sees a marty@@ r in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar itself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bombing ra@@ ids in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters cast four barrel bombs over the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb , so that not children play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the painting c@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland ha@@ i@@ ries come mostly only in winter to the surface .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship S@@ anna .
born in 16@@ 24 , he swi@@ ms through the North Atlantic at a speed of 1 km / h - until today .
Greenland shar@@ k only get offspring with 150 years of age .
lei@@ surely , the Greenland shar@@ k flo@@ ats along the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean , in an hour it reaches an average of just 1.@@ 220 metres .
only when it arrives , the five meter @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates on a saddle of 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
but this lifestyle embos@@ sed by slow@@ ness seems to be a recipe for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at least from a Greenland shar@@ k who might be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ma@@ dness &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; comments Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock , this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist assumed that Greenland will be stone age .
only the evidence was lacking .
Greenland ha@@ ie is hard to observe , after all , they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the thin@@ ly populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in the winter .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks .
their slow pent@@ ag@@ ons were they , when they allowed six animals to be equipped with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
nevertheless , this sh@@ arks make this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
possibly they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ ro@@ ls at the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and seek cad@@ aver , that tor@@ ches from higher water @-@ layers to the bottom .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks which fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ res long while the largest size was 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the lens nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this center of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it will not be renewed later .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably plenty of carbon @-@ 14 in the l@@ enti@@ l nucle@@ us .
their birth , therefore , should lie after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons search for larger quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere .
on the other hand , in the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ ers length , the l@@ enti@@ st had a small amount of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons tests , which is likely to have celebrated his 50@@ th birthday during his investigation in 2012 .
on the other hand , all larger Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks had normal carbon @-@ 14 @-@ amounts in its l@@ enti@@ l nucle@@ us , which results from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 for a 4@@ 93 @-@ centimet@@ re @-@ long Greenland shar@@ k , while the record shar@@ k could be even 3@@ 92 years old with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers .
that Greenland shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers could assign an age to the length .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature stand and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks with the multip@@ lication obviously leave for at least one and a half centuries .
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such Meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live above all in icy waters is no coincidence .
the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 @-@ year old Greenland w@@ ale , whose bacon at the neck was a 120 year old har@@ poon point , was captured in front of Alaska .
the low temperatures often cause the organism of the animals living there on as@@ par@@ ag@@ us flame .
so they mature later - and age slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals often become particularly large .
the volume increases much faster than its surface by which the animal feed@@ backs heat .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much greater than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as soon as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein .
a very large animal should , on the other hand , invest his resources more into a long life .
building site in a double pack
in the recent meeting , the Municipal Council has focuss@@ ed on issues relating to construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the committee adopted the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , the marketing of recently reported resi@@ dences can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the land , par@@ cel@@ i@@ fication and settlement issues were clari@@ fied and the applications could be sur@@ vey@@ ed , the sale of the land in the residential quarters &quot; Street L@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( section Bin@@ der@@ straße - expansion phase 1 ) is no longer in the way of interested parties .
the community council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau will appeal to young families and other sen@@ iors .
as it was said , voluntary builders can immediately announce themselves to the town hall , and the municipal council is expected to receive deliber@@ ations in its September meeting .
in order to meet also requests for the settlement of other commercial enterprises , combined with the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided to change the land use plan that was newly created in the spring of this year in sub @-@ sections .
in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ larvae , the industrial area which has already been declared there will be extended by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from the Bre@@ x@@ it
the City of the Main has the best chances to attract jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt has benefited most from the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Compet@@ ence field for financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum it is uncertain whether money houses will continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport , they have so far been granted approval in the United Kingdom .
this is why large US banks are taking advantage of this .
several banks have already announced to reloc@@ ate jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lob@@ b@@ ying association counts 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk record ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) is headquartered , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Luxembourg is home to a large fund sector , but it also cuts like Dublin with the infrastructure .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .
furthermore , the city with easy @-@ to @-@ use commercial real estate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , it is not easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Seine , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than on the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the management consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city is located seven , Luxembourg at number 19 , Dublin in number 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concluded the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my economic researchers .
the balance of forces : in London , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , and in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead receives funding from hepatitis C patent law@@ suit with Mer@@ ck
an American Ju@@ dge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was freed from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were related to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including per@@ jury and other un@@ ethical actions .
when the suit was filed on Thursday , US Secretary Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to a reduction of the costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck is trying to equ@@ ate Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medication , which can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck used to su@@ e each other and claim ownership of laboratory work containing Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
troops backed by the United States say they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
troops supported by the United States have rec@@ ap@@ tured full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters left the city , a spokesman of the group on Friday said .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) stem from the rem@@ nants of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city .
they have freed more than 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , shared Shar@@ on Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j military council Reu@@ ters , which was allied with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under full control , but we are running clean@@ up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton published her tax return on Friday for 2015 , this resulted in the Pres@@ idential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , Clinton &apos;s USD 1 million donated funds for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ em@@ or@@ aren ; the former State Secretary issued an income of USD 3 million from the Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for her office in the State Department .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ presi@@ dency , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax statements for the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hero@@ in Jen@@ ni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false statements and re@@ trac@@ ts regarding his previous promises to publish his tax declarations .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , although they are not obliged by law to do so .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the move , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign hero@@ in Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , with regard to the publication of the Democrats candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , tr@@ ump special advis@@ er , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish anything before the tax inspections are not completed .
p@@ umps critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , donations for charitable organisations , his business units and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown the issue and published a video on the Internet on Friday , in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump calls for his tax return to be published .
on Thursday she spoke about the topic during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and to publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Politi@@ co announced that during the 1990s , Tr@@ ump has paid no or only very little taxes for two years , and an economic journalist from the New York Times quoted a series of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers on Friday , stating that this could still be the case .
in the election campaign , federal taxes have become a topic .
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million will pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in O@@ ma@@ ha last week , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial glomer@@ ate has his seat here , Tr@@ ump to a meeting to exchange their tax declarations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax check by the I@@ RS and Tr@@ ump is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; afraid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the voters and not from the tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax returns as far as 2007 .
the Clinton &apos;s now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , aver@@ aged an effective Swiss tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 4@@ 0.5 % .
the government &apos;s tax return from 2015 showed that they only procu@@ red USD 100 of their income as wages , unlike most Americans .
their main investment was an affordable index fund from which the Clin@@ tons contributed divi@@ den@@ ds and revenues of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ bic , fire@@ works promote dance ani@@ as elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going to inhabited Sett@@ lements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ rea .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea for years ago , intensified its promotion along with the U.S. natural protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without hur@@ ting animals .
before that , many sp@@ ears used to defend themselves .
Friday is World Phone Day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , although they are much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants off their fields without damaging the eleph@@ ants , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps comprise the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition switch .
when ign@@ ited , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust in the air .
a touch is usually already sufficient to chase away the elephant .
one last possibility is a shi@@ py@@ ard who shoots a fire@@ work fire@@ work into the air and causes a loud , bright explosion .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , we welcome new businesses , but at this location in an exposed location on the Rhine river , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director dis@@ integrates Berlin hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election has been removed after &quot; Arab &quot; request - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media watch , after betra@@ ying that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin has not listed an Israeli pre @-@ election because Arab tourists &quot; requested &quot; according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; issued his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the list of country &apos;s list of countries .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that could be called directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and wi@@ ped out ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel via an own call center .
looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sent him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it was even more anger in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election be er@@ ased , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great shame &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were app@@ alled and troubled by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large resonance in the internet , in which people called it a scandal .
some submitted to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have indul@@ ged in the alleged demands of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another article in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is situated in the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Lanz@@ mann , reported Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to not include Israel in the fast electoral list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police deploy tear gas &amp; rubber missi@@ les against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students joined the police on Thursday in Sao Paulo , Brazil , when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police used tear gas and rubber missi@@ les against demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , leading to the fact that the police used rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about their plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are converted to save money .
some of the Protest@@ ants saw Gra@@ ff@@ iti@@ ts against the preliminary President Michel Tim@@ er to spray on walls .
the recent protests took place a few days after demonstr@@ ators left the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trading turnover between Moscow and Te@@ hr@@ an rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the year @-@ on @-@ year .
since international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest in Russian enterprises on the part of Russian businesses grew strongly , the ambassador announced .
Russian companies are taking up existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further expansion of commerce is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade boom was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes for this year by a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , Russian foreign representatives issued some 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries where the number of tourists in Russia is concerned .
one could say that record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year broke , &quot; he said .
at the same time only a few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who received monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .
witnesses wanted : beverage market flooded into forest fires
a rob@@ ber@@ y attack was carried out on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ der Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the support of a fire@@ arm , three dark dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ bled their faces , asked the employee of the beverage market to hand out cash and then fled first to foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf .
the police do not share how much money was captured .
the perpetrators are said to have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 metres tall , so relatively small .
the beverage market is accessible and poorly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
after the attack , the perpetrators must be sc@@ anned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and escaped from the gravel parking lot located opposite the car park entrance , possibly in the direction B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observations at the time of the attack ( at 7.@@ 45 p.m. ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y , should urgently report to the police .
Nag@@ old : playing and having fun during the summer
eight beautiful and happy days the children and youth of the social pedago@@ gical day group / social group work of the children &apos;s protection federation Nag@@ old with their supervis@@ ors spent their summer break in Nuss@@ dorf near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
the life @-@ joyful group was quartered in the quiet leisure centre of Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ ven during the first week of school holidays .
several day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand , it went to B@@ saved with a visit to the stro@@ king zoo .
on the other hand to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guidance in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the daily life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days the group was delighted at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited to jump , swimming and plan@@ ing .
children and car@@ ers with their own prepared food such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese were p@@ am@@ pered .
in workshops , be@@ ati@@ fied , beautiful pieces of jewelry made of pearls and stones were created or made of wood a Roman mill game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bun@@ te evening &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the day of the journey home the sun laugh@@ ed and the children and young people returned home satisfied .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : the Pil@@ gri@@ m to the Do@@ or of Mer@@ cy
the stran@@ ts from the sea sor@@ ber unit Ey@@ ei@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
four stages were cop@@ ed together .
in order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage of all the regi@@ stran@@ ts in two years , the St. Anna Sec@@ ret@@ ariat has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage migration .
various pilgrimage destinations were tested and eventually chosen for the Bishop &apos;s City of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , the Mer@@ cy of Mer@@ cy on Freiburg Cathedral was a special pilgrimage destination .
16 And min@@ is@@ ites out of Bit@@ tel@@ bron@@ n , and Cal@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the holy rooms , went their way .
in the evening , Re@@ ver@@ end Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims at a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgri@@ m crosses and shared the pilgrimage route .
from Hor@@ b there was driven by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster &apos;s dear wife is standing and so the pilgri@@ m was ki@@ cked off from Münster .
each day and evening the individual day tours were framed by a short impulse with different prayers , songs and texts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is crossed ropes , chap@@ els or churches to sing together a song from a specially composed pilgri@@ m song .
the local par@@ ishes of the local par@@ ishes were available for overnight stays .
at the destinations Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller provided a tasty and star@@ chy evening meal and breakfast .
we continued on the second day on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the next day , the trip to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting track , had to be lowered about 500 metres in the heat and then climbed again afterwards .
the deserved reward was a shared barbecue at the Bad@@ wei@@ her in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter it went on to the final stage to Freiburg .
visi@@ bly facilit@@ ated and happy , Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg Cathedral in the late afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy .
God thank@@ ed God with a little impulse .
in the evening mass in Münster , the Min@@ is , arrived at the destination , were welcomed by the co operator Markus Ober@@ t .
after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau @-@ metropolis .
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite achieves gold for cycling
Scottish Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ zed last evening in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for glory when the British team defended the London 2012 title .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anch@@ or@@ age which his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made herself to E@@ igen . the hun@@ ts@@ man made the legend hau@@ gh@@ ty when he stor@@ med home to make a victory from the favor@@ ites New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after taking a modest sixth place at the London train championships in London , despite the Ho@@ ys left .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as an execution .
Ho@@ ys retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton attempted to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner won a olymp@@ ic record in the qualification laps , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ der fell short after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a big part of the transformation , driving the Hin@@ ds in a higher gear to slow down and make it Kenn@@ y and , above all , Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ ter when they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a flat@@ tering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for me .
we set up an Olympic team in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the 2012 triumph on the Gary and Ho@@ ys side , Hin@@ der admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the train .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no appeal of England &apos;s rival .
with such an outstanding victory there was no such problem this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like the whole UK flags on the tri@@ bun@@ e like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in velo@@ drome .
with the form Kenn@@ y it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on that day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a prize of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same as that of Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y is next in the spr@@ int , which starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
Hin@@ der said , &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to k@@ night . &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
the world record , which won gold in 2012 in London , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the contest , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
yesterday he had fought with officers before qualification when officials called him to measure his body size .
in the appropriate women &apos;s competition , which will be continued tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie moved into world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK team is relying on his strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a crowd of med@@ als .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
dra@@ mas played out in the background , such as the resignation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical leader in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and bul@@ b@@ bling alle@@ gations as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
but when one looks at the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , can be repeated again .
future of the mel@@ tdown of Port@@ land due to the elimination of the energy yield
the future of the aluminium melt from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the system operator can termin@@ ate the energy supply contract and thereby lift all delivery contracts , such as the supplying energy company .
this step followed the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old subsi@@ dy will exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the Al@@ coa site in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects since the melt @-@ mill uses around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vic@@ tori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa acquired the point Henry Schmel@@ zer@@ ei , which last year led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea Force Plant .
the Al@@ coa melt in Port@@ land loses money and risks closing .
this step follows the long @-@ term spec@@ ulations regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will termin@@ ate their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p maintain smaller shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means another physical demand for electricity by melting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have come into effect from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
contracts have a 12 month notice period , so they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , AG@@ L assumes that contracts in fiscal year 17 will contribute to revenues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential rami@@ fications for AG@@ L revenues from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L indicated that the value of the contracts had already been written down in its annual revenues of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of cancellation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ bility Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt , or to ensure the electricity supply to the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not impaired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which should have come into force from November this year , even if there is still an explanation as to why it has res@@ igned from the contract .
analysts warn because of the poor economic situation in the industry prior to the possible closure of the Port@@ land melting plant in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
referring to the Analy@@ st &apos;s statements at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations said Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen that Port@@ land annually uses around 600 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts and Tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of electricity .
if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and it wouldn &apos;t be good for us as a generator , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and running at Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans @-@ like ? ) , craw@@ led reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( except for the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) as well as in the presence of the most popular Show@@ bi@@ z @-@ uncle and producers of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) .
this represents the stere@@ otyp@@ ed plot of almost every birthday celebration of a children &apos;s program ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls participate somehow at this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim might have beaten her , as regards the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference that resembles an illustrated book rather than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of adverti@@ sers ( Th@@ ose Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome ( 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover star is expected so eag@@ erly that in the last two years pictures of the magazine le@@ aked before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , model@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models , celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar award winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jen@@ ni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the former category , she is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers from today who know how to shoot a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if this applies to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who sign up in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s success is not pleasing to everyone .
with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position in the world of fashion was always somewhat stra@@ ined .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed her and called her &quot; Mist@@ akes of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings came up again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but running around on the disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
she and all her sisters are selling pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sold her pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is seen in Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
congreg@@ ational Centr@@ es annually assign 160@@ ,000 people per year
more than 160@@ ,000 of the most auxiliary tools in the country are rejected annually by the municipal centres , while the industry insi@@ sts on the impact of further medium @-@ cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ vings and similar - are rejected in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the community , which are already fully utili@@ sed , are ready for further cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from June next year , it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l &apos;s community centers said that the latest survey of the National Association of Public Appe@@ als revealed that thousands of people have been rejected every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only get worse without repe@@ aling the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land congreg@@ ational centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people of important services you need are rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been dismissed un@@ ju@@ stly - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot obtain the help they need .
the federal government will shor@@ ten the funding by 30 percent by June 2017 , which means that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call on the Chief Prosecutor and the Federal Minister of Justice and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately lift these funds so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their communities , and that the Government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign charged after employee re@@ port@@ edly pulled weapons
new York : Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s campaign has been indic@@ ted because of alleged in@@ activity after she was told that her campaign manager for North Carolina put a fire@@ arm on an employee in February while traveling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment , filed on Wednesday in the Charlotte Regional Court by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i announced to have been waiting for months to keep the matter internally regulated before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign manager , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulled a gun , put his right foref@@ inger on the trigger , and tigh@@ tened the barrel in Vinc@@ enting Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i in his indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
having compla@@ ined to the local and regional campaign leadership , B@@ ordin@@ i realized that at least four more people had made the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he admitted in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to cause damage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation came only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered a rebellion when he said to a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - gun@@ men and weapons friends - should take action if his rival should be elected H@@ illary Clinton and appoint judges .
the campaign made clear that the media would have torn his words out of context and that he would not inc@@ ite violence .
B@@ ordin@@ is complaint demands compensation from the campaign for breach of duty of care and of Philip for body injury and permanent psychological damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hope Hi@@ cks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; press report was not to be reached for a comment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
attempts to contact Philip also failed .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer a member of the campaign .
he was not responsive to phone calls from his consulting firm , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services .
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has so far managed a controversial campaign .
the trial is B@@ ordin@@ i v. Donald J. Tr@@ ump For President Inc . , 16 @-@ CS @-@ 14@@ 300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) .
Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before federal elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) significant losses for the government parties SPD and CD@@ U are distinguished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this resulted in representative surveys conducted by the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition could barely go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible after the survey data in Berlin .
in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance of continuing to position the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , the SPD over@@ threw 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent from five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party was just under the CD@@ U , which could rise to 23 percent again .
the third place is controversial among the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would represent 19 percent for the first time in the Parliament .
despite light losses , the Gre@@ ens hes@@ itated to return to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag despite light losses ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the Parliament with 3 per cent respectively .
according to the survey , the vote for the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties was only 23 percent ( 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they were still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but left with 15 percent before the left ( 11.@@ 7 percent before ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented with 14 per cent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
with 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , but the pirates would not miss the entry in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
email and internet in slow motion : the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market 20 years ago .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the unit weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , so it wasn &apos;t good at hand .
on the contrary , it was pretty cl@@ ums@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory at the beginning was eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would today suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; occurred exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros , lovers can buy the devices on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it trade fair in Hanover as an &quot; West@@ ent@@ asch@@ al Form . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot of SMS and e @-@ mails , even by fax , the communic@@ ator was to be contacted .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , albeit slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
quite proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could suspect in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s &quot; cell phone industry experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold to Microsoft and handled .
today , the market is dominated by suppliers who came all far later than Nokia .
always and everywhere online , this is today for a lot of people &apos;s everyday lives .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
some 1.4 billion devices were sold , on Samsung and Apple alone 5@@ 55 million units were sold .
worldwide sales of the equipment are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of countless app vendors and telecommunications companies .
in the meantime , a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone .
the key breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs at Mac @-@ World announced the introduction of the iPhone .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communic@@ ator , all with touch screen easy to use .
Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al procession began , and today , the iPhone is the Group &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the look@@ out .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the Sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
on average , every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to get the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me , it was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London when we took a great effort to make sure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics gave big advantages to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies close to He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities , we will have 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips alone , 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding He@@ ath@@ row is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will embar@@ k on the world stage .
the two @-@ f@@ ellers had wron@@ ged in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers any question posed to him .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , to create £ 2@@ 11 billion in friendly growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment in both the airport and all the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row who has implemented a £ 11 billion of the infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - which was chosen for five years as a result of the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to T@@ 2 built in the midst of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks in the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
London &apos;s 2012 Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and to bro@@ aden He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ atz and M@@ ouse Game &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding ad blocking &quot; &quot; &quot;
for companies that earn money with online advertising , one of the software vendors tries to circum@@ vent ad blocking , a &quot; scratch and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertisements on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to once again block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop site would change the coding for its advertisements , to make it difficult to detect advertisements of which part of the page advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokesman of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her battle between the line @-@ up Open Source Community and the b@@ yp@@ ers has been underway since the invention of advertising block@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicators have become the industry .
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people use indicators worldwide , almost four times as much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users working on Facebook about their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook &apos;s advertising revenue .
the company has adverti@@ sed it on desktop PCs because mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a speaker .
advertising on desktop PCs is making a big contribution to revenue , making Facebook an investment in such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ad Pre@@ ferences tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give people more control over their advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ Blocks would be wor@@ rying about new filters because they would also block content on the site that is not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Facebook spokesman said in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool , which is why we instead focused on Develop@@ er tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into people &apos;s hands .
woman in case of presum@@ able suicide on Swiss highway
the victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night .
the police are calling for witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday passed by a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman lay in the dark &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 , who was driven by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , the police , who , as well as any witnesses of the incident , asked to sign up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investig@@ ative process was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , distributed G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the public prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers will not be held responsible .
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the motorway as it was called in the newspaper .
last year a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the negli@@ gent killing , after crossing a man and killing a man who was lying on the A1 near Pay@@ erne for one night in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and is unconscious in the street , took the court .
the court noted that the polic@@ ew@@ oman who responded to an emergency call -- in a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely extraordinary and unfor@@ es@@ een situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has more information on the incident on Thursday near Morges , should contact the police at 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus once inhabited
Venus , according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , was probably once inhabited .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies in NASA developed a model to explore the past of Venus using tools and algorithms resem@@ bling climate researchers .
the model was designed to determine if Venus could have re@@ acted with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once earth @-@ like conditions .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and slowly resum@@ ed .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably referred to more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from fast evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus is exposed to the sun side of the Sun for almost two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this he@@ ats the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus , which resembles the evolution that was previously suspected of planetary researchers .
although it was supposedly inhabited , Venus - over several billions years --@@ was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans dark@@ ened and their water vap@@ or was blown away by ultra@@ violet light .
when their Hydro@@ gen escaped , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide was left with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy returns as a coach of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy returned to the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che as coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations on Thursday and led to a low share of co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternative President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new coach .
&quot; over the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement .
in the course of the summer , I &apos;ve been thinking about how I could improve this team to give him more depth that needs it and bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the Vision of the Trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization .
he must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick told me about this decision today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future .
during his debut season Roy has won the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best trainer of the league .
he led the club to 112 points and in the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was hit in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the re @-@ season in each of the two last years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the game for a second wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two compositions with the Montreal Canadi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ ther@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , strike out strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles for the remun@@ eration for North Sea oil workers will be suspended , while all parties sit down on the table for a new round of discussion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the Oil Field Service Wood Group were conducted spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the development process of the present dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold a few full @-@ day meetings over the next few weeks that will start at the beginning of next year to address the problems .
the trade unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has reduced rates to its counter@@ parties in the North Sea by around 9 per cent as a result of negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s credit rating is followed by a 10 % drop in on@@ shore sub@@ contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company give the company the necessary space to get through the market swing .
shell has dischar@@ ged thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ connection with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that has intensified by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest work disputes that took place in the North Sea for a generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to spend on new projects in the North Sea , compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star @-@ run of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades cluster .
the new data helps astronom@@ ers understand why stars revol@@ ve around star @-@ pile to different rates and in what context the rot@@ ational periods are associated with the planet formation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope that through compar@@ isons of our results with other clusters , we find out more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the star @-@ star of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light@@ years away from the earth .
many stars in this cluster of stars , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ thood .
they are now swi@@ vel@@ ing fastest .
at peak rotation rates , these po@@ ign@@ ant stars rep@@ el large amounts of star @-@ winds .
since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star is aging , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars rotate as less solid stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , whereas bigger stars speed pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
as the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the P@@ lei@@ ades cluster offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and so to speak , hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the ple@@ ading rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball cap ki@@ cks off
the tears ran with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eball cap in the best days of Base to Base .
after his emotional release , the 41 year old professional will wear the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on 12 August against T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say goodbye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game atten@@ dee of Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez became the most valuable player in the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract earned him $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and a youth coach - with full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 issues for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed some mile@@ stones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two more bas@@ eball players show similar values in the most important statistics .
but the 41 year old is not likely to be included in the Ruh@@ mes@@ halle of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field so controversial is his appearance outside the place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star became &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to have been banned from 2001 to 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , due to involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis scandal , he was locked for 2@@ 11 games by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to have been the main suspect for years to have received funding from an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida .
after a legal dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done it a favor for 2014 , because I played through 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez back then . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his farewell @-@ days are not sil@@ ently silent .
while many bas@@ eball legends have been playing the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who had been married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az , was re@@ port@@ edly said to the conditions with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , sympath@@ ies of the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e arch@@ rival Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the supporters sang at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez @-@ Team .
Olympic 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : due to a positive dop@@ ing probe , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland may not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing events .
an informed athlete had won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3,000 metre barrier runners in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested in Brazil and excluded - immediately prior to the start of the already critically acclaimed athle@@ tics cont@@ ests , these news come to an end .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de was established last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed its expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old finished fourth in the final over 100 m of butterfly , just about 0.@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have participated in the advance of more than 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter very seriously and requires full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history the IO@@ C is no longer responsible , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
also during the night of Rio the news of the positive rehear@@ sal in Dan@@ ek@@ ova had le@@ aked through , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Ath@@ le@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is said that the EP@@ O blood dop@@ ing agent will act in the forbidden substance .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova has been suspended for the time being suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should have been positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported his criticism of the athlete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chronic dop@@ ing @-@ poll@@ uted nation may not take part in Rio .
on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , was tested positive for the an@@ aboli@@ c ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier .
both deny the ing@@ es@@ tion , but both may not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes the Dan@@ ek@@ ova case is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the World Association IA@@ AF banned the entire Russian team until an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing , even the Kenya L@@ äu@@ fer@@ ing Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in addition , in the course of swimming , the previous contracts in China were also provided for violent confron@@ tations among the athletes .
Fren@@ chman Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium over 200 m of free style , I want to hand over myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also the focus of a debate with Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing frau@@ d@@ sters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun had been tested positively by the Chinese championships in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ ine , but had to sit only a three @-@ month lock .
data W@@ rite : hack@@ ers black@@ mail their ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mail malware are currently targeted at targeted companies - and are successful in doing so .
according to a recent survey of malware infection specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes among 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months were at least once , sometimes multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming for ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again .
according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , the perpetrators are increasingly speci@@ alizing in attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially squee@@ zed ran@@ som will be considerably higher than for private users .
&quot; we are currently observing a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot;
in 2008 most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ Program@@ s were still designed to send advertisement .
then the perpet@@ rator discovered black@@ mail software for himself .
first of all , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was frigh@@ tening rapidly in recent months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works on a simple pattern : once on a victim &apos;s computer , it purpos@@ efully searches for recently changed files such as Word , Excel or database files , as well as for archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
then the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
to get the final encryption code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin .
but where the personal photo database is at stake in private users , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops .
accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes .
22 percent of affected German companies reported loss of revenue by ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely inter@@ rupt the business operation , in one case , people were in danger of life .
several hospitals have already been victims of attacks in Germany whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t pay , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back .
in view of stand@@ still in operation , it is difficult for managers to reject the claim of the perpetrators .
the hack@@ ers , in turn , know that and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , F @-@ Secure safety researchers have examined the user areas and contact with black@@ mail and come to the conclusion that the perpetrators are actually attempting to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money .
they explain to their victims per chat , how they can pay via Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support sites or de@@ cryp@@ t for free example files .
and if private people are rede@@ emed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to get their data un@@ encrypted .
considering the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , hack@@ ers are becoming more professional and sharing the work , security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski says from the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware within one week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons .
the program@@ mers are then selling their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual black@@ mail .
the malware kits so far have been created by buying malware , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ mail then searches for more hack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service economy .
so , one logs in one of the forums on the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and instruc@@ ts another one to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made per infected machine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with spreading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of respon@@ dents in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust Ran@@ som@@ ware to be able to fend off ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful closure , the perpetrators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing models , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the potential for damage , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before .
in future , the perpetrators are likely to take entirely new goals on the internet of things .
at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz , Def@@ con , safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the release of such a blocked heater may well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the offen@@ ders then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda will pack everything : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and also the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds fairly over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the front row and in the rear , it does not work in any place .
the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit upper side drops down there .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles when it comes to storage space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a 4@@ 53 l luggage compartment on raised and 10@@ 26 l available with rec@@ essed back rests but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat areas of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinema chair and therefore offer a storage space that is 1,@@ 24 m high from the floor up to the ceiling .
the trunk can be loaded well , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
he should , however , make his work a little qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
another engine is available : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the handling is well balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering should be somewhat more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the safety systems include the City emergency brake assist ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because he points out many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in maneu@@ vering . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remote lighting assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed controller re@@ acts to traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed if required .
but the full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI @-@ jack lie underneath the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel is fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will get the gasoline from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with Euro 6 emissions standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
airline not liable : flight on passenger bridge
an airline shall not be liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is conceivable only in case of dangers which are typical of aviation .
the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken a knee cap during the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline didn &apos;t have to pay any damages to the man .
case of illness : when the organis@@ er pays
ill holi@@ day@@ makers only get money after their trip if the cause of the disease is undoubtedly found in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests show the same symptoms .
in the case , a family was heavily ill in diar@@ rho@@ ea and vomiting on the second day of their tur@@ k@@ il .
she spent almost all the holiday in the room .
their illness brought the vac@@ ation@@ ers back to a defective treatment plant , which allegedly poll@@ uted sea@@ water .
the family believed that the trip was lacking - and compla@@ ined against the organis@@ er .
the pla@@ inti@@ ffs did not succeed in court .
the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organizer only learned about it shortly before the departure of the pla@@ inti@@ ffs .
he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine .
he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , so the judgement .
no contam@@ in@@ ants were found in the samples of the water .
the illness of several hotel guests - possibly caused by con@@ ta@@ gi@@ on - belongs to the general life risk .
of 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 wre@@ cked .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said after the violent acts committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have worried about further attacks .
the state must react to terrorism and react calm@@ ly at the same time .
for sure , our country will not respond to the violence perpet@@ rated by the perpet@@ rator with hatred and cle@@ av@@ age .
we will not treat this triumph to the terrorists .
if offen@@ ders need to leave the country more quickly , however , the security and strength also increase the approval of the population for refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals up to the Bundestag election 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced further personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle four @-@ digit order over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must again be punished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance should be improved , the weapons law will be am@@ ended so that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recently discussed duty of sec@@ rec@@ y for physicians should be maintained according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to look for solutions how the threat of citizens can be reduced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , looking at psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to counter@@ act the ra@@ dic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers better social support necessary .
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister of the Interior clearly spoke out against activ@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a sla@@ p for the sni@@ pers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel said to the newspaper of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double nationality before . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a general ban on the general wear of the veil is constitu@@ tionally problematic .
you can &apos;t forbi@@ d everything you reject , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ q@@ a .
talk about rules about street traffic or for witnesses in court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green Party leader Sim@@ one Peter accused the minister of trying to simulate new anti @-@ terror p@@ act and act of action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ wing party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet S@@ prü@@ che and a tigh@@ tening of the right of stay bring people in this country no more security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway feeder
it regularly takes toll on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this should change : the legal ab@@ dic@@ ation will be extended . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is good news for all car drivers who are standing in traffic on the ambient street every evening in traffic jams when driving over the highway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road construction will be extended on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Straße and the departure Wes@@ eler Straße the right @-@ hand bend lane by 700 meters .
drivers can then go straight from the Hammer Straße to the right .
the big advantage : traffic split up early , which improves the overall circulation of the route on the busy section of the federal road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit was the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder is getting annoying , especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the back@@ stage goes up to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her path and sometimes beyond .
the reason is the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 just before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here on the traffic is guided only by lane by way of the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be rebuilt several years ago .
the reason : static calculations have shown that the bridge is no longer the required load force in order to record the heavy load traffic in two lane .
as long as this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the connected working daily traffic jam will continue , the competent state operation cannot say .
however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : because the bridge has an official resi@@ due @-@ duration until 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal de@@ fle@@ ction strategy , the state company deliberately chose the more traffic @-@ less time during the school holidays because it was to be expected with disabilities .
traffic is passed on Tuesday and Wednesday without trace on the construction site .
intercultural travel : cultural offers for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Forest School visited the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are planning a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s association allows young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule children &apos;s house has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Junge theaters in Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 19 students between eleven and 15 years visited the production in Small House . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster in the context of this project .
most of the youth in the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations it was possible for them to follow the course of action , thus the press release of the Junge Theater Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg of language , and the Junge Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical dis@@ sem@@ ination are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
in view of the increased number of refugees , the association expects many classes to take part .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for weather improvement
the weather has made the shooting stars in the southwest of Germany on the night to Friday a line through the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was poorly suited for clouds and rain , to observe the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , Friday morning .
our hope is on the night of Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we will surely see many shooting stars in the sky .
the Stern@@ schu@@ ppen are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which belong to the fastest shooting stars with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which goes up in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening , one rolls around forever , at night , one is awake for hours , in the morning it is long before the wake @-@ up ring no longer to think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent find their sleep frequent or permanent as not relaxing .
what are sleeping problems or sleeping problems ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many reasons behind them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , a member of the board of the German Society for Sle@@ eping and S@@ leep Medicine .
what you understand for the time being , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , that is , a single and transmitted disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is precisely the sleep that many people feel as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of the German GP with practice in Var@@ el in Lower Saxony . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what &apos;s behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
there can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors behind it , but also drugs .
not in@@ frequently , sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is especially frequent in case of depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ ak . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors require each other .
for example , if you have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , it can be bad , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to think about everyday problems and worries , We@@ ak gives an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should sleep disorders become a doctor ?
anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor , advises We@@ ak .
the impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments such as stomach or headache .
to allevi@@ ate the sleep disorder , it is important to find out the causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medication - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired .
Dr. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary dormit@@ ory medical centre of Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin , emphas@@ ises the low level of sleep health in Germany .
for this reason , you should first contact your family doctor if you have problems with sleeping problems , advises We@@ ak .
this can be clari@@ fied by examining whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep or what happens ?
for example , in case of snor@@ ing with breathing drop@@ outs , in case of sleep problems , in case of sleep problems or if one does not find the cause of a distur@@ b@@ ance distur@@ b@@ ance , Fi@@ etze explains .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a nap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after glu@@ ing , you go to bed for a normal time .
besides the electrodes in the body , one carries a nose go@@ ggles , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler on the finger .
in addition , a camera on the ceiling draws attention to the sleeping places .
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a few screws on which you can set for a better sleep .
We@@ ak counts : regular sleep and rise time , not too long in bed , not sleeping on the day , not watching TV for falling asleep , avoiding alcohol and not looking at the watch at night - then you begin to reck@@ on immediately , and that &apos;s totally not condu@@ ci@@ ve to it .
what the jungle camp has to have with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ ser expressed himself on Facebook for dis@@ ap@@ pointing the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he received gold for the first time at the World Championships in Doh@@ a . at the same time he set up his first world record .
now , the former DS@@ V @-@ athlete Markus Dei@@ bler has placed himself in front of his ex @-@ team @-@ mates in front of his criticism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic winner gets 20,000 € and a jungle king 15@@ 0.000 € should not be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote in the night to Friday on his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pumping system in swimming @-@ sports is bad , but the dop@@ ing controls are very good .
this means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look exactly at D@@ oping or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he continued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , Dei@@ ser would have to report to Germany ( NA@@ DA ) nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly what you should do with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who cannot control a certain time before WM / OS by independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the election @-@ ham@@ burger who now operates an ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : gang of luggage thi@@ eves arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Dus@@ sel@@ dorf Airport
on Thursday , civil victims of the police in Düsseldorf managed to arrest two women and two men from the age of 50 to 61 .
the susp@@ ects had committed several bag and baggage ste@@ els as a gang .
at 21.@@ 30 , civilian officials in the area of Dus@@ sel@@ dorf recognized a gang known to the polic@@ emen from the past theft of theft .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July and participated in a collaborative , labour @-@ intensive and professional manner .
the specialists of the criminal com@@ miss@@ ariat 34 can prove four actions to the thi@@ eves , who had come to Germany to commit crimes committed exclusively to commit crimes .
in total , they had captured a total of more than 15.000 euros .
old buildings , a few lime trees , in between still a rem@@ nant of cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not seem like that , but the police are among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
going along the road from east to west you pass play@@ grounds , a freshly painted kinder@@ garten and a bike shop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ugly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demoli@@ shed , it is already built : a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here by 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article on this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , is , however , favor@@ ed by burning cars in recent weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the inhabitants rented rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and used for events .
since the beginning of the year , the Berlin interior sen@@ ator has repeatedly expressed itself in a hard way for the police against the project , the area referred to as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for police officers and the 94 as a point of departure for autonomous violence .
after clearing the premises on the ground floor , the cad@@ mi@@ ths , with 300 police officers , the police pat@@ rolled over three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site , blocked portions of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
in the meantime , the building workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown house owners .
on 13 July a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the clearance was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers with@@ drew under the ju@@ bil@@ ation of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking about late i .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there are primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kiev since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who has three children here , are mostly anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the residents of the house projects , they share the fear of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it doesn &apos;t sound like a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who wished for majority police protection from v@@ and@@ alism left . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police force between house occup@@ iers and their neighbors , apparently does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working class , which today has a low average income and a high risk of poverty in comparison with the rest of the city .
in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , among them almost the entire Main@@ zer street very close to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer had been ev@@ acu@@ ated under a large police force , many of the projects in the Rig@@ a@@ er were leg@@ alized and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the city has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and elec@@ tors from all over the world over the past few years .
this is also reflected in the rent , which has increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : you can recognize them from thrown slices or freshly painted fac@@ ades thrown with colour @-@ bags .
no other road was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours regard this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : crimes like violation of the body are according to statistics almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen .
the biggest part of the off@@ ences constitute damages , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in a ten@@ ancy house next to the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
when it comes to violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who were certainly not .
even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
for the architect , her street is not a criminal centre , on the contrary : &quot; here you help each other , live together on the road and get more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer was consciously pulled into the Riga road - and remained .
that is why it was so important that the residents get their streets back : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the deut@@ ungsh@@ oh@@ eit across the bor@@ ough .
but in the eyes of the inhabitants like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away from them : through fac@@ eless new buildings in former buildings , which sup@@ plant the old residents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , these are con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - here people who are not so well @-@ beha@@ ved are living here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely cannot appro@@ ve of violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should you do if someone never hears someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer showed little bit of understanding for draw @-@ out people who were angry about color bombs : the house projects and the left @-@ hand scene were part of the Kie@@ z neighborhood .
those who draw you should be aware of this - just like someone who runs into a pub district , can complain of bad about noise there .
all persons presented with first names have asked not to be named with their correct name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new Refu@@ gee Officer
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the refugee representative for Ur@@ bach .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger &apos;s administration .
she sees herself as the contact person for all actors : refugees , working groups for refugees , administration , authorities and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine Customer of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ ving wo@@ ollen mil@@ k@@ ins@@ ane , which above all has a problem .
this meant that some - less mo@@ cking rather than relying on the multitude of demanded tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job .
we were looking for an administrative professional with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an egg @-@ reli@@ eved wool mel@@ on .
but administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organisation , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position on three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports hon@@ orable and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
new containers are soon standing in the Was@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the follow @-@ up refugees that have been recognized .
the local authorities are responsible for the provision of the connection .
you must submit the refugees in your own or rented living rooms .
the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the District Office to the municipality and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
de facto , the administration does not find private apartments .
so far , it does not work , unless one relies on private dwell@@ ings , according to Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common dwell@@ ings need to be emp@@ tied , as it is called so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be set up in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine client and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent residence , there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and job opportunities for refugees and migrants who need to be trained or set up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more places would be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Reg@@ ine client . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many work in the building yard or help house masters , do charitable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
it hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not just mean work .
the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and client .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need offers such as sport , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so administration and hon@@ our@@ able people also jump here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can bridges the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help in Ur@@ bach won &apos;t be able to work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate himself .
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also problems , says customer honestly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people with nothing at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and client is always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a mamm@@ oth task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : do the two after the recent events fear ra@@ dic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some may call nai@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ sed .
these incidents are also subject to refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins destroy them completely .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and hon@@ our@@ able volunteers have to look out for activities in the region and in the region .
they have always been in the background that a new push for refugees and migrants will soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to answer this question clearly , the policy is afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is actually unfair to put them on the spot .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not yet arrived where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would ease the situation .
Reg@@ ine client also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher is already busy integrating the previous people reasonably .
these are currently about 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , they need to help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
