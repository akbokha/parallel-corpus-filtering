<seg id="1">Clintons and slingbacks economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two U.S. Presidential candidates are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">The difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">About the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "Trump wants to keep them in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will massively go back to regulations, and he is strongly committed to a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has to fulfil certain tasks; it has opportunities to open disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why the taxes for the rich will be increased, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "in the future, investments must be invested," "" "says Trump and Clinton." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicant even announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there could be no party discussions on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "the differences in energy and climate policy are more significant." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and return coal mining to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement wants to cancel it.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand renewable energy with its investment programme and demands: "a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want we to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in the infrastructure - even with international trade agreements, the two competitors are not far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazific trade agreement, both do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time both want to isolate the US from international trade, but simply to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should be paid better than Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to rise, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "on the one hand, Trump is standing who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics point out that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least from the rich, stands that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "" "" "assistant physicians have called their union to approve new labour campaign measures in their disputes with respect to a new contract." ""</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) called for its entire Council to approve more campaign measures from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that ministers had agreed to deal with the concerns about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">In July, assistance doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract that was agreed with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in elections.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Russia and Turkey: an" "" "alliance of outsiders" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture which ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin is receiving his Turkish opposite player in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile was slippery and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restrained conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report whole five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if something bad had never happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiating, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the contrary, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the downturn of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to that time was rage.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin condemned Ankara, accusing Ankara to turn Russia into the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The expulsion was even greater, as it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building the cousins is difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media launched a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan to listen to.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to make a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire lie clearly on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan first needs all the friends he can get after he has been relieved during a failed coup d'etat last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey severely - especially the prohibition of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal onslaught of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agrarian imports are allowed to return.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Večsti says it follows:" "" "tourists there, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious at the West as it regards its response to the attempted takeover of power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "to this end, the continued resentment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to withdraw from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won in Ankara with security a bonus that after the attempted coup d "état he demanded support for the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present, as an analyst once described, "Alliance of outsiders."</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, in spite of public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even stalled the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences while Putin decided to emphasize them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey shot off the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state are at least talking to each other.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin firing Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin recently dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV was part of the narrowest confidence circle of Putin many years ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old has been appointed as Special Representative for Environment and Transport.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin, it is stated that without giving reasons, Putin had" "" "ordered the discharge of Ivanovs from his duties as President of the Presidential Administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who was a substitute for Ivanovs since 2012, was named after his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in Tallinn, Estonian capital in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is called (in Russian) that he was later the administrator and chief of staff of the government officer.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think that it is the government's main task to support your work as head of state concerning bills of law and controls to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with Ivanov asked him to leave his post and recommend Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince you?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow more mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest familiar Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is this the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who was once touted as a potential president, at once intended to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to give me this very complicated post - one could almost say - to entrust some arduous items for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the position in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Prior to that he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin is a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once believed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become President of Russia, since a third term Putin had violated the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another ally close ally Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closing stages of the" "" "deck blower" "" "approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge cut from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 bevels.</seg>
<seg id="7">The project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister for Economic Affairs, Keith Brown, visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment when building Queensholiday crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of engineering art from a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky job that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">All in all, almost 79% of the total bridge deck is in place, and the last section of the deck is now available in Rosyth for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, Project Manager of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "" "the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of future-oriented high and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last street-deck and its connection with the north turmdeck in the expansion, we had to close the still existing gap on the northern or land side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeter south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very delicate activity at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive as the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards in an incline of approx. 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate because the tolerances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunting for health and happiness</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenage and child can no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their spare time sitting on screens, was lamented over the last decade by many.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go, it's about getting people off the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">That's why it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities don't mutually exclusive each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I naturally refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on characters created for video games in the 1990s (later they created a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">As many phenomena of pop culture the interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand decreased at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed due to the massive demand that the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go out with their smartphones and search for Pokemons tracking with a GPS, and once they have been found, they will be "photographed" (using a screenshot on your mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the ahn and leapt for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game resulted in a considerable increase in steps that the "average" person returns every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardio, an app for Apple Watch, tracking 35.000 users, announced the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of followed people who train every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays the Pokémon Go - it merely sees the raw data for improving performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns on health people want to "take 30 minutes" time, "coming from the sofa," and "being active every day" touched deaf ears because many public messages are dull to health and come from people looking miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports will reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that is fun for them.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health are covered - motion, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also towers that have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough occurred.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they didn't give us a reason to do sports as this game does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will be diminished with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="17">She expected a final examination in Brazil, a competition not so much between Bilesh and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>

<seg id="27">Swedish Beams and Bodenturns - in which Biles holds the world title - lauded.</seg>
<seg id="28">She retreated with 15,433 on the balance beam again - and with a 15,933 on the floor another one on it.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her gently as she expected her death - a pure form of formality - and tears flowed on cheap glossy red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collective book became reality.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heavy rainfall and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to call on the emergency stand on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Numerous rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi flooded its banks and threatened with large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards stated that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and help the communities affected.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, told that the requests for high-water vehicles, boats and sand bags were increasing.</seg>
<seg id="6">Steele said that alone the community of Tangipahoa had requested ten thousand sand bags.</seg>
<seg id="7">A flood warning system is used for large parts in the south of Louisiana to Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="8">The weather service announced that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the south of Alabama a flood warning system was used on Friday, while it was still raining in the Mobile area.</seg>
<seg id="10">The river Comite near Baton Rouges and the river Amite close to Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, will probably reach record levels over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="11">The metalologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also said that a downstream flooding in Ascension Parish is a danger, as these are only slowly flowing into Lake Maurepas via the well-trodden rivers.</seg>
<seg id="13">The river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi national border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest state ever recorded on Friday at 09.00.</seg>

<seg id="15">Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those who were rescued near Gloster on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet from his house, grew strongly overnight.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that another stepson who lives nearby would have warned him.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "we woke up and the water flowed and poured in," "" "said Hansford." ""</seg>

<seg id="20">His wife said to Hansford that she had never seen such a high level in the 48 years in which she lived there.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hansford said he and his family members were all handicapped and he would be the only one who can swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hansford said that Nothelfer had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were accommodated until Friday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Krautmann said the" "" "Flooding" "" "had" "" "spread out quickly" "", "as there continued heavy rainfall and that the authorities would consider evacuation instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Krautmann an observer reported in the proximity of Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inch rain.</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said that the ground had been considerably weighed down by the rainfalls since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">The authorities stated that heavy rainfall and street flooding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school failure in five school districts.</seg>
<seg id="27">The CBS subsidiary, WWF, reported that an orderly in Tangipahoa attacked 200 flooded houses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches which were both flooded.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Chief of the Municipality of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals rinsed by floods.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency shelters were set up to accommodate the evacuated people.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "as soon as the water starts to go back, they will be able to return to their homes," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">In the town of Hammond of the community of Tangipahoa, almost two dozens of roads were closed because of the flooding and sand bags were provided for the residents who hope to keep the water out of their houses and shops.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "the last major flood we had was in March," "" "said Lacy Landville of the city administration." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine under the Women's Olympic Championship in the Turns and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, since 1984 I have been with every summer Olympics, and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who had an inspiring effect on many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess, and Madison Kocian, who is catholic, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one female gymnast was an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year were Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a startling Olympic winner and was jubilant in America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world championships in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful Gymastics routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual multi-event event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this kind of sport, but that's not what trainers all over the country look like.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie hit all the same way as Aly and Madison to join the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "" "because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts primarily in private gyms that can be maintained by parents which pay for the training, furnishing, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families). the list can be continued arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "the majority of these trainers are in wealthy suburbs that can support business." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Bilesh, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to aun countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to provide an affordable and easy-to-reach exercise.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnastic foundation 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events, we have offered free and affordable Turns in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (above all black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics, which deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong advantages for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that will make thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by holding the Olympic team golds and thank you for motivating so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA Committee of Regions, announced last night in a communication with: "assistance physicians have serious concerns about the proposed treaty, in particular that it will heat up the current workforce crisis and treat it to justice to all doctors."</seg>
<seg id="6">With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress has to be made and the time is running out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts by the BMA to resolve disputes by talks were to take part in the government for reluctance and sometimes on ear-numbing silence.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed from office last year for the release of a government report for corruption</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim congregations is knowingly ignored, as a devastating government report today disclosed.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally accuses police, election observers and town halls to ignore evidence of electoral fraud as a result of" "" "violations of ethnicity and religion" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "the former Minister for Integration and Local Government, who is now an anti-corruption coalition, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set shut-off tapes outside of electoral cabinets to protect intimidated voters."

<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlet's electoral scandals in east London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special court ruled that the incumbent mayor Luton Rahman should be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman would have perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in cynical fashion" and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobias charges.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have led "his campaign on the basis that it is the Muslim duty of Muslims to choose him."</seg>

<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence of deceit throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He expressed himself in particular alarming on the fraudulent mail-election - with the older members of the Muslim community put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the leading of ID cards to prove identity</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "in his report it says:" "" "as evidence has been indicated that pressure has been exercised on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, in order to elect according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistan or Bangladeshi background."

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We spoke with Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you're approaching from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn your robber around the skewer.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you approach you from behind, you should turn around as first, so that you can see your attacker and move out of the firing line, "says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the weapon between your forearm and shoulder to face it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Strike it with the knee in the lath and twist, while the attacker clings in front of pain, the weapon out of his hands. strike him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">With attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the firing line, grab the weapon and twist it, so that the attacker cannot shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, shift the weight onto the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of his grip, before moving backwards and directing the weapon to it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>
<seg id="11">Watch the video to see exactly how it performs in Mizrachi.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveler withdrew his immune system and sausage-lex of a serious test by leviing some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk crashed his train on a euro note, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a flush of a toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before leaking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he will get involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought to lick the flush of a toilet that was used by thousands of others may be totally revolting, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe Mr. Wright talked to doctors and healthcare professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left what he licked out, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became known to test the resistance of his bowel by travelling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public money at railway stations to purging of toilets, the task definitely put its immune system under a test</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he said:" "" "as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was able to meet his reputation in any case.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sample painting showed a luminometer count of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the luminometric speed of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick off after her luminance speed was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "that comes close to the worst that I have seen in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing cleaner than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick here because it is disgusting inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we really wanted to offer the consumer something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we performed crazy brainstorming that ended with saying" "" "Let's call us Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a greater context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added:" "" "let me tell you - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he liked some of the things I told him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick them and others, in which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty gadgets on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of respondents associate lactic acid bacteria, in particular with the well-being of stomach and gut, and 58 percent said they use at least occasional products containing lactic acid bacteria added.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left their apartment after a delogivation with a loss of £50,000 because it had terrorized its neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being forcibly removed from their property, employees of the housing cooperative found their property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls had opened holes, wooden planks were piled up, rubbish was dispersed on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family were resettled and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer to be repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think people don't have to live in that way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider, as this property is thought to be regarded as not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted on street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, strife and flight.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name stood on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behavior in June.</seg>

<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing ogierte she and her partner forcibly from the property this week after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have had the family to cooperate with the local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="26">Rubbish and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown site of the community house.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he added:" "" "it is a shame that the lessee agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family, as a delogivation is always the final step that Cornwall Housing takes into account." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be terribly mited.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated." ""</seg>

<seg id="4">After an attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village Kenya sent a trainer home.</seg>
<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee announced to immediately set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">A Kenyan member informed that the former Sprinter and today's coach John Anzrah, in the Olympic village, gave a urine sample under the name of the 800 meter runner Ferguson Rotich.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the doping controllers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The IAAF World Association has requested the IOC for information on the case to exert its own investigations, and announced an IAAF spokesman.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "depending on the results of the investigation and subsequent measures taken by the IOC, IAAF will evaluate a rating," "" "said IAAF." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "he (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and released himself as Ferguson Roti, released and signed the rehearsal," "" "explained Kenya's chief de Mission Stephan Arap Soi." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, who stood on the list for the training control of the World Anti-Doping Agency.</seg>
<seg id="12">In 2015, Ferguson Roti had become more than 800 meters in the Beijing World Championship.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four days before, Kenyan athletics head leader Michael Rotich was withdrawn from the Rio games.</seg>
<seg id="14">He is said to have informed athletes of his country about upcoming doping tests.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to media reports, he was reported to have been arrested at his return to the Nairobi airport.</seg>
<seg id="16">Kenya has long been under special monitoring in the IOC following numerous doping contracts since a long period of time.</seg>
<seg id="17">During the announcement of the more than 2000 doping destination checks taken by the IOC before the Rio games, it was unusual to point out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted.</seg>
<seg id="18">The World Anti-Doping agency had exerted much pressure on the African country before the summer Olympics in Brazil, creating an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was passed a few weeks before the Olympics began.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a result, the WADA Kenya participated in the list of countries whose doping fight conforms with the rules of the WADA.</seg>

<seg id="22">The athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a series of TV reports of the ARD, allegations were repeatedly raised that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a significant mentality of sports betting.</seg>
<seg id="24">The IOC member Richard Pound recently asked for a similar investigation in Kenya, as he had employed in Russian athletics.</seg>
<seg id="25">It could be proven that in this kind of sport it was thought-wide and systematically thought-up.</seg>
<seg id="26">Russia's athletes were thereupon excluded from the summer games.</seg>

<seg id="9">It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>

<seg id="11">In this production Bartoli plays an older Mary.</seg>

<seg id="13">The role of Maria always fascinated me.</seg>

<seg id="16">She says in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."</seg>
<seg id="17">So she is wise, naturally also naïve, and very passionately.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it is very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," laughs Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."</seg>
<seg id="20">It is such an honor for us to work with her.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is an enormously generous person.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "and Bartoli returns the compliment:" "" "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="24">You see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it is his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.</seg>
<seg id="26">We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a happy approach to life, which is very important at all!</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals do not get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">They have understood Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021 the country election will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because stupid as up to now it is not: summer holidays, heat and country weather combat - that bites.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be persuaded by the election fighters, are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">The most holidaymakers in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so don't choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, spread flyers, and counting out voices only arduously.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until 4 September 2016, the polling and final day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has to pass the election campaign just under the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase when you can tell it at all has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear for his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly newcomer AfD will cut off and what remains at the end of coalition dust.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost unobtrusive campaign for election, one sees from his big posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, distributes roses and chatting a little with the people, just as his legendary eloquent predecessor Harald Ringstorff also did.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, sailors have cold feet and chancellor Merkel can blame the AfD's blossoming.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "their refugee policy, their" "" "We create this" "" "has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU, with its leading candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to make an election campaign at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">German Chancellor Angela Merkel has invited her to major documents; Merkel Bundestagswahlkreis is located in the north-east.</seg>

<seg id="24">"" "this," "" "Kokert," "" "means only a" "" "subordinate role" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "the Union has also noted that on the land it crumbles the base that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again." ""</seg>

<seg id="28">Because there is a lot in the game, Sellering has now called his SPD a particularly committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys, the Socialists and Democrats last 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just in front of the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the vote in 2011, the SPD won still 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, the small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the holiday-need and mainly transfer their campaign to the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30 a.m. and end up at 8 o'clock in the morning, praise is everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "they did everything pretty shaky," "" "says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet fuel station." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay as well.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything should be finished.</seg>
<seg id="8">There will also be a commendation of those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site was moved south on Monday and the closure of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted and thus also the connection to Rottenburg has been restored, the traffic situation within the town has eased.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now travel on both sides by Ofterdingen from the B 27.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "the" "" "evasive traffic" "" "through the place seems to go back." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some considerable complaints," says the deputy head manager Florian King responsible for the transport-related management of the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstrasse, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many creeks were looking for and more familiar to their navi than the signposting.</seg>
<seg id="14">What caused some trucks to become frayed in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the speed limits were not met, the municipality demanded an increase in the vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>

<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been braked.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest speed was 77 hours per hour in the pace-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, however, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business people at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that the road to customers from Rottenburg is now open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to revenue breakthroughs leads everyone to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>

<seg id="25">"" "Thomas Sulz also speaks of a" "" "at most slight drop" "", "but also admits that" "" "the running search is missing" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The most strongly captured are the restaurants along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, former crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential threatening.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "not only him, but all the restaurants have" "" "hit hard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">The customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>
<seg id="31">We must be happy about every Euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">At the same time, the sales impact is much higher than 50 percent. "</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "the street refurbishment was" "" "thrown back two years" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "half of his employees have to be fired." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been released, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President of the president Jörg Schmidt responded to a request by Göhner, if there could be a financial compensation, otherwise the restaurant benefits from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages inherent in the rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties, where something more generous has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all complaints, Göhner is confident that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">Finally, the family business has been here since 1715, it refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">It can be understood that other regular guests are now less frequently passing by because of the complicated traffic guidance.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't go here, it is also somewhere else beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his stem cells return to the end of the redevelopment work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crisis with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner sees the effects of the B 27 construction on his customers for the biggest crisis, which his restaurant has experienced in its long-standing history.</seg>

<seg id="15">"" "" "" "the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">In part, de Maizière is starting a second attempt for proposals that have not been done with the SPD so far: he wants sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and knocks off jihadists with dual citizenship to the German passport.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "these will be difficult spots for the SPD," "" "says the CDU man." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">He nevertheless believes this to be reasonable and also doesn't demand anything that has no chances in the coalition partner anyway.</seg>
<seg id="19">De Maizière also presents a few new ideas.</seg>
<seg id="20">They are in part: he plans rapid procedures for deportations and more possibilities for detaining people from deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted at the country should check their smartphones and open social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the case of tolerances for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to put some worse points than to date - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to disguise their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of these are politically and legally uncles.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some also have an unfinished effect and leave questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="25">And at some points - in the imbalance of patient for example - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be argued that the assassinations of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In view of the high number of refugees, many people were worried about safety.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that deeply devoted people could not be clung out even during election days.</seg>
<seg id="30">Inner security has moved enormously.</seg>
<seg id="31">First the kicks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, there are electoral campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="35">On the subject of internal security, the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly turning into position.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the past few days, between the two parties went high.</seg>
<seg id="37">Only a grievous argument about the facilities of the Federal Police, then via a security policy collection of some Unions interior ministers, in which the resort chiefs also demand a burka ban and a return from the dual citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière also painstakes here to reconcile conciliatory sounds.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lone middle-aged men love records.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you come to the comment section, to savor it under the pseudonym of non-AlleSsamenmen middle-aged with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the multiplied reformation of vinyl records is not due to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight at the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older records retain their emotions rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit and I'm wild before I stop, hold my hands and say something whisper like: "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera off for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to assess their age and minds through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, to whom I am of Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged males) into the Reckless Records (number of data: eight middle-aged males, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I wonder?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I appreciate," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have approx. 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress the walls of his sitting room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford than they appeared and buy items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things in which I was probably something too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and would like to spend time alone, and add: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets on the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media team, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations that I have led, people usually get rid of their collection so as to get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like phonica to see that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers accepted the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, from objects that watch joyful youth memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">It's like a collector so I think it's like that among many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is an easy way to get involved spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "an employee infused from a stack of records." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet heard of it.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey found out that 41% have a record player they never use while 7% of those who buy a record have no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I smoothen through a pile of bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle-aged men) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone came here only recently and said," "" "I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead Schallplatte, so that I can put them on the shelf," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-centered, less music-grade.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say," "" "I don't have a record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who come in only slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has dedicated the records almost a whole floor, has a blower audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, teenage children and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts latest synthesizer and sex packed pop instead of experimental jazz from the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but nailing psychic traumas are hard to find when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the shop for several minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window bumper as a wholesale purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve a lot, so collecting plates is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is... "it drives off with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I am giving the impression of mustering the jeans pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are considering buying a crossover record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "plate art" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there's nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is also the one most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research showed that the results of YouGov vote, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors, who exist in reality, record shops and online forums, are not considered.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They don't spend their Thursday morning with the bumblebees around Berwick Street and the sheets through sheets, while they steer clear of the startling view of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who worries about the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary stores and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to submit 72 temporary contracts in which persons within the camp sell goods, cigarettes and energy drinks, sell, offer hairdressers or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture has argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which contain a fire and sanity risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also assumed that temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people conducting the 72 temporary operations, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely understandable. "</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers have to adapt to the next generation speed measurer: in different federal states, among others in Hessen and Brandenburg, new flash units will be tested, which should be particularly effective.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic Enforcement Trailer of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on motorway construction sites or to rehabilitating bridges with temporary templating there is often no necessary infrastructure in order to provide a stationary flash for compliance with speed limit.</seg>
<seg id="5">A permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days for uninterrupted measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">Laser measurement technology allows all vehicles to be collected across multiple tracks at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits and drive-through bans by time, travel stripes and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">The trailer can be moved in a state-of-the-art condition according to the manufacturer, with each car with trailer hitch.</seg>
<seg id="10">So that it is not easily stowed, it is lowered in the measuring mode, so that the wheels in the armoured and by the way also sweat-proof outer shell disappear.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain in the 7-year Rugby came to an abrupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were defeated at the Deodoro Stadium in Rio with a result of 43-7.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji granted a master class in handling, side steppes, crutches, line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympiamedaille of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was missed by the not too bad trophy of the silver medal - Great Britain on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The obvious defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of that, Fiji would have hit a 15-man team in the form of this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It might be a consolation for UK - but it probably won't - that at least a Briton tomorrow will have a gold medal hanging around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, former head coach for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, she lost each match at Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began to wonder and let the attacks of GBs jump out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if they were running in running buses. the World Series winners moved 5-0 upwards, when Osea Kolinisau moved in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another offensive from the right corner he converted.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB have hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A terrifying hack of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third goal, but Fiji only stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, Veremalua posted a touch down in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the re-pfiff and there was still more than a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressured by further weak Tacklings of the UK team and stormed to the line to make a fool.</seg>
<seg id="20">The transformation took a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.</seg>
<seg id="22">That is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB performed fundamental changes in half-time and closed the fijian gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half, until Joshua Tuisova went through a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went long in favour of the South Sea sulfitters, whose fans sang, flags swayed and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame did the finishing touch with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounded, the fijis embraced and GB crunced into the turf.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a scarce semi-final match from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown moved forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a score among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony the English 15-Aside team ensured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the fight with the trainer's cancer for a rowing victory</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more emoteric gold than with these games and that wants to be called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rudder up to the last, 220 hard drivetrain that goes into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional importance in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">There were three voices in the boat even if there were only the two of them sitting at the helm. the echo of the coach Robin Williams was all present when they followed the second Olympic gold in two without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British Sports, who set such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolute, at least their 39.ter unbeaten work, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant female athletes who glide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the nature of triumphal.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the herd is a battalion of willing helpers who make a difference to incremental progress that makes the difference and there was no one of the aids as the coach who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risked.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that was operable and that did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you don't do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been quite a bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes slightly the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he was able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, in the event that under such circumstances it is the right term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared millions of additional costs.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that the industry threatened from green electricity production are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it remains in the liberation of the Renewable Energy Transition in the existing plants for the so-called self-current production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" "" "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" "" "(WAZ, Friday edition)." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gases from blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry predicted an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, now there is a fundamental agreement with the European Commission following discussions with Commissariat Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only if the generators in the steel works are replaced, an EEG levy of 20 percent falls.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this is not levied in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed the agreement between Germany and the European Commission on its own electricity generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">In doing so, the status quo of the previous regulation will be largely determined.</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry is particularly important.</seg>

<seg id="17">Since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe suffers from overcapacity and considerable price pressure.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation continued to aggravate when the world's largest producer of products threw massive steel to the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers reproach Chinese steel companies with price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has eased a little.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, impregnated import duties on import steel show effect, on the other hand the economic prospects in China were brightened up.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how long lasting the price recovery is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, prices would have stagnated.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">In doing so, ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steel manufacturers remain cautious.</seg>
<seg id="29">At 3.4 million tonnes, they produced six percent less crude steel than in the previous year, as the Steel Association announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short increase in May, the manufactured number went back to the second consecutive month.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent lower than the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">Thanks to an improved order situation, the association expects a rising output in the coming months.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing is good for seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in school choir, in the Lehramt university she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "singing moves me emotionally and physically," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more lively, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and her spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors chant in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, Hackler describes.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular interaction, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "speaking and organizing, to be able to rely on others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand their lungs get out of the brush even in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an ideal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "singing often has a very special effect on older people," "" "says Ursula Lenz from the federal labour community of senior citizens." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, common singing had a much higher priority, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, it explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz frequently observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">By song lyrics and especially melodies, people who have dementia are devoting themselves to long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">While singing the head requires a special performance, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time concentrate on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - that's a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just elderly people who live on their own are doing so not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition gained by singing in the choir, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for something long for something, I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are plenty of good reasons to start singing.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you want to try out a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can hear when a tone goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior choir, you can easily join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews over the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">You can find many old seniors over the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you do not have access to the Internet, your family, friends or neighbors can ask for help in the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Anyone who wants to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that is true for any age.</seg>

<seg id="6">In this regard, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, such as rubbish.</seg>

<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosive device had gone into the air in a flower patch in front of the territory of the coastal police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, there were several detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast, as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast several wounded.</seg>

<seg id="19">In the attacks, Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist revolt or with international terrorism.</seg>

<seg id="23">In recent days, the authorities have kept secret information about imminent attacks in the south of the country, but they were not informed of the exact time and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police ransacked their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings, airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment quarters.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are repeatedely smaller bombing attacks, but mostly they do not direct itself against tourists.</seg>

<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military considerable influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta Chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos, while the country turned towards stability, an improvement in economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody upheaval, reaffirmed itself to have led the kingdom to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect as Asian cartoon criticized</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired but some observers say it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtering tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that is already adjacent to the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are blunt, self-rotating tools that generate more than 30 million selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All missteps go to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have been criticised in the past in which they were accused of promoting the app Blackface promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week suggested to some users a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and indignation were disseminated on Wednesday, with reports by The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat shared that it would have disabled the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company apologized: the filter was intended to pay homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who experienced racism, the filter reminded of hurtful clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the Anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American student whose tweets were widely used over the photos, wrote that the filter was "hurtful and mildly unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the contrast of a very reluctant Asian caricature and filtering effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-proof, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the depreciating extrem.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration battle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats great audience of young people - who are more different than their older opponents in terms of race - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchats filters produces a picture that is insulting to a user, "it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed when it was the case earlier," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who works as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay on medium and in a telephone interview she said that she believes that racist-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the settings of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the great part white, only male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that snapchat largely left unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures for the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a speaker, the company recently set up a personnel manager focusing on underrepresented population groups and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu also said she will close her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users than us to say that it's not O.K. '.</seg>

<seg id="1">Military leadership forfeit ISIS intelligence information, rejects Committee of Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when it allowed the actual conditions on the ground, an investigation committee of the Congress announced in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of Republican members of the Committee of Armed Forces, Secret Service Committees and the Military Commissar, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their estimates of American efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information that was typically clicked off by high-level Centcom Commanders regularly reported a positive image of U.S. efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual states on site and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article cited the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," stated Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there are no direct indications that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts faced pressure from their hierarchies to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the congress were significantly more positive than the facts." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigation, so much is clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the tops of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to downplay the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called on the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigation continues.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigation of the Centcom reports is under way by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly restricted process for establishing intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services," "" "said the highest-ranking democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process," "" "Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "corrupted the moral under analysts and" "" "gave too little room for dissenting opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no clues to the intervention of the White House at the Centcom analysts with regard to a "political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by" "" "The Daily Beast" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's General Inspector, who were taken up after complaints by Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, there was a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the congress, while the investigation of the General Inspector was still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome controversial discussions on these key issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the allegations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of intermediation of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush presented only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the insurgency against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker stated that contrary to the government's statements against the refineries held by the Islamic State, no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group would have, as these temporary refineries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This knowledge, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcom's former commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for its excessively positive assessment of the situation at a hearing in front of the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="10">However the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex, four years after they landed at the last 12 squares at the last London Games.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the rage of the Olympic Games, the zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro make sense constantly and inevitably, a raging relay race between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is handed down from the crossbow to the swimmers to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't switch to television, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the waiting queue in the coffee shop, without hearing about Simone Bilesh, Katie Ledecky or the argument between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's swarm with dimples, could have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic arena.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports, which are not generally recognized: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swimming and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should make modest arguments for my particular favorite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years has been so sparsely perceived that many of them, I had questioned, did not know that it is at all an Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to competition, there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal this year from London.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charme, partly because it sounds more appropriate for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschool than the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a hereditary enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonical tremor of its never-ending collision - but also the Grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports it essentially unites.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "Trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Aspiring champions jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling moves (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "they are assessed according to the official Olympic program according to the execution, degree of difficulty and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vectors is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must go further, faster, up and down in their quest for gold, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes up and down, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only chase the finish line or the exit wall, but also another ridiculous goal in the televised broadcast: that of the world or the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purposeful striving is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even touch a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel as a bit tiresome when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Vector of the Trampoline Skip is on top.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces down, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then downward, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">Here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final hours of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block from 14.00 onwards.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the angling and the objectivity of male athletes - as the male US gymnasts recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his breath-blowing, new fanbase.</seg>

<seg id="1">"one-generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia met with the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses testified that tens of thousands of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police at gunfire.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia right to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last few months, protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more territories.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the government's response was relentless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">Videos that are in circulation over the protests, probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security officers strike young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it was always difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa's Horn of Africa, the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiopians in order to fight terror threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Although Ethiopia is anything but an example for democracy, human rights organisations have continued to suppress the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted and dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or sent to prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "when you suppress people and do not have any other options other than protesting, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">All the youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold with regard to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a widely-criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions along the border to Eritrea are rising; a struggle for this shaky, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts are concerned that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which were forced more or less forced in recent years, could exploit the turbulence and re-arm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are exploding after years of suffering from the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years many Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media because cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave that they were so protesting.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, who from Athopia, prospered predominantly Christian highlands, in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this too changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are going to co-ordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Vegetechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in the areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairably dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray who account for around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is Meles Zenawi's death.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopian prime minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailev Desalegn, was selected for relatively impermeable reasons in order to adopt the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia had experienced such an uproar was in 2005, after thousands of votes were protesting against elections which, according to the analyst, were apparently fueled by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed, even though they were less than in the last months and that time of unrest was over relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and their measurable progress in poverty alleviation.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously, this has not prevented the intensification of the internal disgust of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes on a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharan city, attacked by Tigray and hatred of the Tigray becomes more and more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests are bringing the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, although it recently shared that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While Westerners clearly want to support democracy, he doesn't want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump declares his claim to Obama that IS was founded "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump, on Friday, was trying to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multiple-repeated assertion that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terror group, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions on the communications capabilities of the Republicans presidential candidate whether he was able to communicate with the American public clearly and intelligible.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings along its comrades, who endeavour to take protection during an eventful phase, in its peculiar position, to explain the assertions which he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump reportedly drew back to the assertion on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the contrast to the previous day, where Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant accusation completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt asked Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by recalling that Mr Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism encapsulates Mr. Trump, while trying to steer the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling demand.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were talking to the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he was heavily criticised when he said that the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's email, but he said later, "Of course, I thought it was sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then postpone as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "I think it's one of his ways to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, how they arrive, and then possibly" "" "clarify" "" "depending on how the reaction expires." "" "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in a variety of ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has assumed a more etched tone as his demand values have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris published on Friday showed a lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is in general trying to apologize for his provocative statements, he frequently accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is intensifying the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump jokes have brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent advocates of" "" "Trumpet" "", "gave a great effort to defend the candidate in a CNN interview of Thursday." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "Mr. Giuliani asked, therefore, to the correctness of Mr. Trumpy's statements asked if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them hind legs, completely false and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton ministered as Minister of Foreign Affairs, allowed ISIS to spread out aggressively under control of the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of hurting around on each of his words and being preoccupied against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he ridiculed the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "television professionals trying to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats ridiculed Mr. Trump's excuse as just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland hairies come mostly only in winter to the surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">Born in 1624, he swims through the North Atlantic at a speed of 1 km / h - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland shark only get offspring with 150 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely, the Greenland shark floats along the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean, in an hour it reaches an average of just 1.220 metres.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it arrives, the five meter-long animal accelerates on a saddle of 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">But this lifestyle embossed by slowness seems to be a recipe for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least from a Greenland shark who might be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "madness" "", "comments Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In fact, the evolutionary biologist assumed that Greenland will be stone age.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was lacking.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland haie is hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow pentagons were they, when they allowed six animals to be equipped with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, this sharks make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt sleeping animals or patrols at the bottom of the ice-sea and seek cadaver, that torches from higher water-layers to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland-sharks which fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long while the largest size was 502 centimetres.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lens nucleus of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This center of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it will not be renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably plenty of carbon-14 in the lentil nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth, therefore, should lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons search for larger quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other hand, in the third smallest animal with 220 centimeters length, the lentist had a small amount of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, which is likely to have celebrated his 50th birthday during his investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other hand, all larger Greenland-sharks had normal carbon-14-amounts in its lentil nucleus, which results from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 for a 493-centimetre-long Greenland shark, while the record shark could be even 392 years old with 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers could assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature stand and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland-sharks with the multiplication obviously leave for at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such Methusaleme live above all in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211-year old Greenland wale, whose bacon at the neck was a 120 year old harpoon point, was captured in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">The low temperatures often cause the organism of the animals living there on asparagus flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals often become particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume increases much faster than its surface by which the animal feedbacks heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much greater than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as soon as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal should, on the other hand, invest his resources more into a long life.</seg>

<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah," issued his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>

<seg id="2">The strants from the sea sorber unit Eyeial-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Four stages were coped together.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage of all the registrants in two years, the St. Anna Secretariat has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage migration.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations were tested and eventually chosen for the Bishop's City of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, the Mercy of Mercy on Freiburg Cathedral was a special pilgrimage destination.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 And minisites out of Bittelbronn, and Calol, and Haigerloch, and the holy rooms, went their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening, Reverend Storost sent the pilgrims at a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and shared the pilgrimage route.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb there was driven by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Münster's dear wife is standing and so the pilgrim was kicked off from Münster.</seg>
<seg id="9">Each day and evening the individual day tours were framed by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis crossed ropes, chapels or churches to sing together a song from a specially composed pilgrim song.</seg>
<seg id="11">The local parishes of the local parishes were available for overnight stays.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the destinations Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty and starchy evening meal and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">We continued on the second day on Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The next day, the trip to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting track, had to be lowered about 500 metres in the heat and then climbed again afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a shared barbecue at the Badweiher in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter it went on to the final stage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Visibly facilitated and happy, Minis arrived at the Freiburg Cathedral in the late afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">God thanked God with a little impulse.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the evening mass in Münster, the Minis, arrived at the destination, were welcomed by the co operator Markus Obert.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the Breisgau-metropolis.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scottish Callum Skinner razed last evening in the men's team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for glory when the British team defended the London 2012 title.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchorage which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made herself to Eigen. the huntsman made the legend haughty when he stormed home to make a victory from the favorites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after taking a modest sixth place at the London train championships in London, despite the Hoys left.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as an execution.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton attempted to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinder, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner won a olympic record in the qualification laps, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hinder fell short after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a big part of the transformation, driving the Hinds in a higher gear to slow down and make it Kenny and, above all, Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy saw from his position as BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hinter when they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for me.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an Olympic team in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the 2012 triumph on the Gary and Hoys side, Hinder admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the train.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no appeal of England's rival.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory there was no such problem this time.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hinder said:" "" "it feels like the whole UK flags on the tribune like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in velodrome.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kenny it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a prize of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same as that of Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny is next in the sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">Hinder said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51.942 at the destination.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in 2012 in London, was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the contest, where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday he had fought with officers before qualification when officials called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the appropriate women's competition, which will be continued tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie moved into world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team is relying on his strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a crowd of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Dramas played out in the background, such as the resignation of Shane Sutton's technical leader in April in the midst of sexism and bulbbling allegations as well as the retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">But when one looks at the first evening of the competition in Velodrom, it looks like the legendary reputation GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, can be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melt from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are at stake, as the system operator can terminate the energy supply contract and thereby lift all delivery contracts, such as the supplying energy company.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A 20-year-old subsidy will expire in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa site in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs -direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects since the melt-mill uses around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa acquired the point Henry Schmelzerei, which last year led to a closure of the Anglesea Force Plant.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Alcoa melt in Portland loses money and risks closing.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the long-term speculations regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will terminate their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp maintain smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity by melting," "" "said the company." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," "" "Kendall wrote." ""</seg>

<seg id="6">This represents the stereotyped plot of almost every birthday celebration of a children's program (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls participate somehow at this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim might have beaten her, as regards the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that resembles an illustrated book rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (Those Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the tome (615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover star is expected so eagerly that in the last two years pictures of the magazine leaked before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "in recent years more" "" "celebrities, modeln" "" "models, celebrities are" "" "on the cover" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar award winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the former category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers from today who know how to shoot a good Snapchat video (even if this applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who sign up in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenners's success is not pleasing to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With their reality TV history, Jenner's position in the world of fashion was always somewhat strained.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret-Model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "Mistakes of the Moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings came up again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But running around on the displeasure seems to pass by the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>

<seg id="2">Venus, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, was probably once inhabited.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in NASA developed a model to explore the past of Venus using tools and algorithms resembling climate researchers.</seg>

<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and slowly resumed.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably referred to more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected from fast evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>

<seg id="11">This heats the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus, which resembles the evolution that was previously suspected of planetary researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was supposedly inhabited, Venus - over several billions years --was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans darkened and their water vapor was blown away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When their Hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide was left with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="2">Caught: due to a positive doping probe, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland may not start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping events.</seg>
<seg id="4">An informed athlete had won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh competition day, the first official doping cases have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimmers in Chen Xinyi, 3,000 metre barrier runners in Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested in Brazil and excluded - immediately prior to the start of the already critically acclaimed athletics contests, these news come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was established last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Sports Court CAS confirmed its expulsion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old finished fourth in the final over 100 m of butterfly, just about 0.09 seconds missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen would have participated in the advance of more than 50 m Freestyle.</seg>

<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter very seriously and requires full cooperation in the investigations," "" "said Xinhua from a message:" "" "we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the verdict." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history the IOC is no longer responsible, but the CAS is responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also during the night of Rio the news of the positive rehearsal in Danekova had leaked through, the 33-year-old went on the offensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "said the Bulgarian TV channel BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "she is innocent," "" "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," "" "said the Athletics." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, it is said that the EPO blood doping agent will act in the forbidden substance.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova has been suspended for the time being suspended, according to BNT, the B-sample should have been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov immediately reported his criticism of the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said: "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weight lifters from the chronic doping-polluted nation may not take part in Rio.</seg>

<seg id="23">Both deny the ingestion, but both may not start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the start of the athletes the Danekova case is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The World Association IAAF banned the entire Russian team until an exception because of systematic doping, even the Kenya Läufering Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data Write: hackers blackmail their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeted at targeted companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of malware infection specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months were at least once, sometimes multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming for ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators are increasingly specializing in attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially squeezed ransom will be considerably higher than for private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently observing a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the MalwarePrograms were still designed to send advertisement.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrator discovered blackmail software for himself.</seg>
<seg id="11">First of all, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was frightening rapidly in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works on a simple pattern: once on a victim's computer, it purposefully searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as for archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the software presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final encryption code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where the personal photo database is at stake in private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of affected German companies reported loss of revenue by ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt the business operation, in one case, people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">Several hospitals have already been victims of attacks in Germany whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims:" "" "don't pay, you only support the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">In view of standstill in operation, it is difficult for managers to reject the claim of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers, in turn, know that and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, F-Secure safety researchers have examined the user areas and contact with blackmail and come to the conclusion that the perpetrators are actually attempting to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain to their victims per chat, how they can pay via Bitcoin, set free accessible support sites or decrypt for free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private people are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Considering the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more professional and sharing the work, security expert Chester Wisniewski says from the anti-virus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware within one week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that these are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers are then selling their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The malware kits so far have been created by buying malware, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "the scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmail then searches for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">So, one logs in one of the forums on the underground, buys the set of a criminal and instructs another one to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per infected machine.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals employ spammers with spreading," "" "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known for many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of respondents in the Malwarebytes survey trust Ransomware to be able to fend off ransomware by means of file back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful closure, the perpetrators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing models," "" "explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">The potential for damage, depending on the type of data, is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators are likely to take entirely new goals on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerkonferenz, Defcon, safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the release of such a blocked heater may well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the offenders then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V, Honda will pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe and also the versatility of a minivan.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds fairly overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V seems rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the front row and in the rear, it does not work in any place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit upper side drops down there.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles when it comes to storage space.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "there is not only a 453 l luggage compartment on raised and 1026 l available with recessed back rests but there is the" "" "Magic Seats" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat areas of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinema chair and therefore offer a storage space that is 1,24 m high from the floor up to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk can be loaded well, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">He should, however, make his work a little quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Another engine is available: a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The handling is well balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering should be somewhat more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "the equipment in the tested top variant" "" "Executive" "" "leaves nothing to be desired." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The safety systems include the City emergency brake assist (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "the collision warning sometimes irritates because he points out many obstacles as" "" "approaching objects" "" "in maneuvering." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote lighting assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed controller reacts to traffic sign recognition and throttles the speed if required.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the full connectivity is only available for the top features: 7-inch touch screen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and one HDMI-jack lie underneath the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The roughly 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel is fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest so much will get the gasoline from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="27">The engines comply with Euro 6 emissions standard.</seg>

<seg id="2">It regularly takes toll on the bypass road - here a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "however, this should change: the legal abdication will be extended." ""</seg>

<seg id="6">Drivers can then go straight from the Hammer Straße to the right.</seg>
<seg id="7">The big advantage: traffic split up early, which improves the overall circulation of the route on the busy section of the federal road 51.</seg>

<seg id="9">The road narrowing on the feeder is getting annoying, especially between 17 and 19 o'clock.</seg>
<seg id="10">On weekdays, the backstage goes up to the bridge over the Albersloher path and sometimes beyond.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, one rolls around forever, at night, one is awake for hours, in the morning it is long before the wake-up ring no longer to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent find their sleep frequent or permanent as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">What are sleeping problems or sleeping problems?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many reasons behind them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, a member of the board of the German Society for Sleeping and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you understand for the time being, however, is the insomnia, that is, a single and transmitted disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "it is precisely the sleep that many people feel as unsatisfactory or inadequate," "" "said Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German GP with practice in Varel in Lower Saxony." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">There can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors behind it, but also drugs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not infrequently, sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is especially frequent in case of depression," "" "says Weak." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors require each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, if you have a herniated disc, it can be bad, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to think about everyday problems and worries, Weak gives an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep disorders become a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor, advises Weak.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate the sleep disorder, it is important to find out the causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medication - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired.</seg>
<seg id="22">Dr. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary dormitory medical centre of Charité University Medicine Berlin, emphasises the low level of sleep health in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, you should first contact your family doctor if you have problems with sleeping problems, advises Weak.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified by examining whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep or what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, in case of snoring with breathing dropouts, in case of sleep problems, in case of sleep problems or if one does not find the cause of a disturbance disturbance, Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please do not make a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After gluing, you go to bed for a normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes in the body, one carries a nose goggles, a chest strap and a feeler on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera on the ceiling draws attention to the sleeping places.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a few screws on which you can set for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weak counts: regular sleep and rise time, not too long in bed, not sleeping on the day, not watching TV for falling asleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the watch at night - then you begin to reckon immediately, and that's totally not conducive to it.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former German swimmers Markus Deiser expressed himself on Facebook for disappointing the DSV team at Olympis.</seg>
<seg id="3">In December 2014, he received gold for the first time at the World Championships in Doha. at the same time he set up his first world record.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now, the former DSV-athlete Markus Deibler has placed himself in front of his ex-team-mates in front of his criticism.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "in a country where an Olympic winner gets 20,000 €and a jungle king 150.000 €should not be surprised about missing medals," "" "the 26-year-old wrote in the night to Friday on his Facebook page." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The pumping system in swimming-sports is bad, but the doping controls are very good.</seg>

<seg id="8">"" "" "" "I don't say that the controls are to be set here," "" "he continued." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">If he wanted to make a comeback, Deiser would have to report to Germany (NADA) nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA).</seg>
<seg id="10">This is exactly what you should do with countries.</seg>

<seg id="2">Professional thieves at Dusseldorf Airport</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, civil victims of the police in Düsseldorf managed to arrest two women and two men from the age of 50 to 61.</seg>
<seg id="4">The suspects had committed several bag and baggage steels as a gang.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 21.30, civilian officials in the area of Dusseldorf recognized a gang known to the policemen from the past theft of theft.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two women and two men had committed several offences since the middle of July and participated in a collaborative, labour-intensive and professional manner.</seg>
<seg id="7">The specialists of the criminal commissariat 34 can prove four actions to the thieves, who had come to Germany to commit crimes committed exclusively to commit crimes.</seg>
<seg id="8">In total, they had captured a total of more than 15.000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few lime trees, in between still a remnant of cobblestones: the Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem like that, but the police are among the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">Going along the road from east to west you pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a bike shop.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone" "" "ugly!" "" "sprayed on the facade of a grey house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">In contrast to a Lidl, which is to be demolished, it is already built: a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "article on this" "" "trendy neighborhood" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, is, however, favored by burning cars in recent weeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the inhabitants rented rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, the Berlin interior senator has repeatedly expressed itself in a hard way for the police against the project, the area referred to as a "no-go zone" for police officers and the 94 as a point of departure for autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After clearing the premises on the ground floor, the cadmiths, with 300 police officers, the police patrolled over three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site, blocked portions of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the meantime, the building workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown house owners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearance was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers withdrew under the jubilation of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the street works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are talking about late i.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there are primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiev since 1999, and Jana *, who has three children here, are mostly annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the house projects, they share the fear of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "it doesn't sound like a" "" "Kiez" "", "who wished for majority police protection from vandalism left." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin interior senator and the police force between house occupiers and their neighbors, apparently does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working class, which today has a low average income and a high risk of poverty in comparison with the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, among them almost the entire Mainzer street very close to the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been evacuated under a large police force, many of the projects in the Rigaer were legalized and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the city has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and electors from all over the world over the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rent, which has increased by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: you can recognize them from thrown slices or freshly painted facades thrown with colour-bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year along with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours regard this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality: crimes like violation of the body are according to statistics almost exclusively directed against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest part of the offences constitute damages, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a tenancy house next to the controversial 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">When it comes to violence, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours who were certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the architect, her street is not a criminal centre, on the contrary: "here you help each other, live together on the road and get more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer was consciously pulled into the Riga road - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was so important that the residents get their streets back: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the deutungshoheit across the borough.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of the inhabitants like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away from them: through faceless new buildings in former buildings, which supplant the old residents.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "ultimately, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many here - here people who are not so well-behaved are living here," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I absolutely cannot approve of violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should you do if someone never hears someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer showed little bit of understanding for draw-out people who were angry about color bombs: the house projects and the left-hand scene were part of the Kiez neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who draw you should be aware of this - just like someone who runs into a pub district, can complain of bad about noise there.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented with first names have asked not to be named with their correct name.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new Refugee Officer</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organiser.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle is the refugee representative for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of Achim Grockenberger's administration.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as the contact person for all actors: refugees, working groups for refugees, administration, authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine Customer of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the eiving woollen milkinsane, which above all has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">This meant that some - less mocking rather than relying on the multitude of demanded tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">We were looking for an administrative professional with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just an egg-relieved wool melon.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organisation, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine client, that Annika Deuschle supports honorable and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers are soon standing in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the follow-up refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the provision of the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must submit the refugees in your own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the District Office to the municipality and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it does not work, unless one relies on private dwellings, according to Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common dwellings need to be emptied, as it is called so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be set up in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine client and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, apprenticeships, school grounds, one-euro jobs and job opportunities for refugees and migrants who need to be trained or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "more places would be good," "" "reports Regine client." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house masters, do charitable work - and that motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not just mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and client.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need offers such as sport, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So administration and honourable people also jump here.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "they must explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can bridges the time wisely, for example with language courses." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who develop the feeling that he can't help in Urbach won't be able to work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "but there are also problems, says customer honestly," "" "people with nothing at all." "" "therefore, the work of Deuschle and client is always to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is a mammoth task." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two after the recent events fear radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine client quite clearly," "" "what some may call naive." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitised.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins destroy them completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and honourable volunteers have to look out for activities in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always been in the background that a new push for refugees and migrants will soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "" "" "to answer this question clearly, the policy is afraid." ""</seg>
<seg id="59">It is actually unfair to put them on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not yet arrived where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would ease the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine client also makes it clear that the Urbacher is already busy integrating the previous people reasonably.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently about 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they need to help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
