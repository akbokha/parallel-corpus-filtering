Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Teher@@ an &apos;s destabili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the deb@@ ated two @-@ state solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for many years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal struck by Obama on Iran &apos;s nuclear programme has worsen@@ ed the relationship between the two .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the U.S. Congress , which was partly considered as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the election in Israel at that time .
in an emergency call Professor , to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; lamb was important to stress that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably upset , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house the officials found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to undo it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds where he had shot and killed a popular professor of history , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office according to the police .
Delta State University Police officer Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the disa@@ strous cry at some point afterwards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life when the police inv@@ oked him .
one day after the shooting at the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal record .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both were taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty members included 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time , there were some inclin@@ ations to problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , praised the Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he only taught two online courses .
the latest changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard for him , would not represent a guarantee for an automatic path to a position as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ for@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
after the escape from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs later , when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson said .
his car was still in the entrance .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedago@@ gy .
he did his doc@@ torate in the spring of education .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met together by common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar game .
at that time he was the s@@ warm of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls melted when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no document of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , adjacent to a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who now was 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en on his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail performed both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a dim@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 . September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth organ play before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no indication that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first @-@ semester seminar program and specialized in American native and colonial history , told Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his bro@@ therhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight memorial service .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the watch @-@ watch , while the University choir &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ for@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press Auth@@ ors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected in order to reflect that the police now says that Lamb had the emergency call after he had shot and that he called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
To@@ ys R Us plans to employ fewer workers for the Christmas season
To@@ ys R Us says that there will not be so many Christmas seasonal staff as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said that it plans to employ 40,000 people in stores and sales centres throughout the country . in the Christmas season 2014 , 45@@ ,000 workers were hired .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees increases from October to December .
while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business is getting closer and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equi@@ p shops with employees selling , sending and delivering products .
Michael J. Fox is jo@@ king over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat is empty next to me , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an im@@ pending documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins and it comes into my mind that I am a simulated y@@ aw@@ n and a length of length from being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had its premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s real for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time travel film ever made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says that its response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the almost five year conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UN chief once again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member states of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the fr@@ inge of the Council of Ministers of the General Assembly in this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ separ@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban challenged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tac@@ kling the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 Survey results that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks among poll@@ s , it has ( yet ) not working .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously question what it means for the opportunities of nom@@ ination of real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at this time Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of which won only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bus@@ hes Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise tr@@ umps per@@ sever@@ ance and begin to let their dollar flow to overthrow it .
here are some current survey data suggest@@ ing that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tears &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have turned 180 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two out of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P voters were happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans said they were either &quot; thrilled &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent saying the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
on the other hand 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Republi@@ cans does not see the temp@@ er temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters tend to believe that real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number applies in the nation &apos;s first presidential elections , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively execute his office , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament wasn &apos;t fit into the White House , ABC / Post .
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they set up their watch @-@ keepers , Republi@@ can voters consider Tr@@ ump to be real . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten say that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four of ten at the end of July put their money at J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry was winning the nom@@ ination only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it is evident that a large number of GO@@ P voters look at the campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the re@@ public@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to the jumps leadership , while anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is re@@ aping the majority support .
he points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have firmly forgiven their votes .
of course , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , tr@@ umps is the strongest competitor at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have made their minds are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with the topic of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign two months ago called immigrants from Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the immigration and pi@@ vot@@ al point in public discourse was 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of dump @-@ critical His@@ pan@@ o Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can Party and damage new orient@@ ations efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump on immigration issues .
so long as immigration remains in the spotlight , it seems to be Donald Tr@@ ump as well .
the fru@@ stration over the government climbs to new heights .
Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son now have about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Monday @-@ Survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Republi@@ cans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; in@@ fern@@ al . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea .
in the street a square meter of a roof@@ ing house costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the supply of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special locations one square meter is most cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential sites , however , one of the price is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros per square meter , well noticed .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the forefront here .
champi@@ ons League : Bayern @-@ Traum@@ reset thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
double Tor@@ ture in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympic Games Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e gave the FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the witch vessel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus .
the team of coach P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Götz@@ fri@@ es ( 8@@ 9th ) ear@@ ns with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth starting success in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third run .
in the UEF@@ A Champions League , Müller received good assistance from Olympic champi@@ ons Roberto , who left a f@@ lange of the world champion as flan@@ k .
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised in front of the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich held word .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his most recent six home matches in the Kingdom class , including famous clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 also Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled .
but the Bav@@ arians , defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but in their offen@@ sive efforts they were often too einf@@ all to work .
the attacks were often initiated by relo@@ cation to left @-@ handed Douglas Costa , which rarely passed through the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right than his flan@@ k from the right half @-@ field in the left upper tor@@ rent .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first of all , as Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown struck the pole of the Pole by the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct debit , the keeper Roberto was par@@ ked with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians had their usual dominant play , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to set up needle stit@@ ches .
but at Tor@@ cht@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er , he was reli@@ eved .
for example , when he ste@@ ered a shot of ide@@ ye over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
recently he left Gu@@ ardi@@ ola a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it good .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems in the cad@@ re , sat outside at first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero gave the green light only after finishing the final training , said Chief Executive Officer Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to do something else , that &apos;s already vi@@ cious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the ailing Lev@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by eleven minutes mil@@ ler still sat on it .
before the game it had come to Kra@@ w@@ alle in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly mas@@ ked Bayern fans prov@@ oked the supporters of host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went with impact @-@ sticks against the Munich @-@ based supporters .
at least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
those who smoke , not only harm the lungs , but also to the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
the good news : with ren@@ unci@@ ation the risk decreases quickly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold .
the scientists had watched over 23,@@ 300 participants .
main causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ va , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , under@@ lining the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore reduced to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
people who quit smoking could reduce their risk however within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment goes back to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained Dr. Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must convince people to become non @-@ smokers , explained the director H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for lungs and vessels and leads to good dental health until age .
in Germany more than 20 per cent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of denti@@ tion was affected by the DI@@ f@@ E .
earlier studies have indicated that smoking increases the risk of early teeth failure .
the new long @-@ term study substanti@@ ates the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists encounter rem@@ nants from the late anti@@ quity in Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer
archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the time being .
in the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard , arch@@ e@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said Museum Manager Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
historians have been searching for so @-@ called ground monuments since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine .
in all construction projects in the district of Cologne , the museum is always considered as a specialist office for archae@@ ology ground conservation .
in the third phase of the Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard the archae@@ ologists have now found five .
from text documents it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , described Trier .
in addition to rem@@ nants of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with approximately 350 tom@@ bs was discovered that probably belonged to the church .
young woman of freight recei@@ v@@ ables
after a young woman is unhappy at the train station in anti @-@ id@@ ler l@@ enti@@ ls , the Federal Police is asking the population for help .
early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40@@ pm the woman crossed the railway station at the end of the platform and was captured by a train from Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .
as a result of the acquisition of the train , it has carried most serious injuries to the German Federal Police .
she was treated in emergency medical care and brought to hospital by rescue workers .
on the basis of the noc@@ turn@@ al cross @-@ crossing of the young woman there is no evidence to the medi@@ ating officials .
the incident was perhaps witnessed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
local residents or pass@@ ers by Lin@@ der@@ ner Railway , Ziegel@@ wer@@ cker@@ weg , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ straße and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) .
information about the cause of the accident may be given at 24 hours and free hot@@ line of the Federal Police under telephone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8000 or any other police station .
EU Commission proposes new judgment in dispute over TTIP
the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system for the resolution of the dispute over the proposed trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TTIP .
the controversial private mediation facilities for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system which , in its function , is significantly more traditional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens can trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ ström , responsible for the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de intends to bring the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced its support .
TTIP will create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings take place in concrete terms that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to come to equal parts from the EU , the United States and from third countries .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow to raise obj@@ ections to sentences .
until now , the parties agreed to each other on arbit@@ rators and there was no objection to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past few months it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in matters of fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , she wants to work on an international investment court according to his own information .
there could then be clari@@ fied , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) demanded above all by large corporations are considered one of the main reasons for the great opposition in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary that allows companies to under@@ ride damage to the tax@@ pa@@ yers , lev@@ y national laws or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act described the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was critic@@ ised above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German state secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plan as a big step forward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission took into account essential points in the reform that the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU foreign ministers in the spring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the economic possibilities of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged by doing so .
when talks on the TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) agreement can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
so far , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer unten@@ able .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy acting fol@@ ks@@ eller recorded the picturesque US state of Mich@@ igan with felt @-@ pin .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost touched by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells the story of various places he always records on the map , about his meti@@ culous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they were born and how it looks like , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be a wonderful creative person .
with the 2003 released and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs seem to be harmonious very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into the great opul@@ ent .
it is rum@@ ored that &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 States states should be followed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and has positive expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
his guitar and ban@@ jo meet him live .
one year later the musician living in New York returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) a master@@ work is published in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exu@@ ber@@ ant to ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the amer@@ ican b@@ ill@@ board charts and is missing in no yearly list of influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic distribution pieces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ b .
since the smaller club has long desc@@ ended , the stage shows are presented here for the colorful spectacle of Ne@@ on @-@ forehead @-@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ member band .
in the dark ham@@ burger More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2,000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the St@@ ev@@ ens , which has become much more mature , returns to in@@ timacy and folk .
without a word to judge the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ened album .
from the audience one hears : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and one can therefore throw away the &quot; record in essence . &quot;
only after an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens would like to thank St@@ ev@@ ens , playing acousti@@ cally few older songs and finally turns to thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s frac@@ ture
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s frac@@ ture has been eag@@ erly awaited since his election .
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will debut his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ c@@ esses and set himself up for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to address the first of his six pre @-@ set questions shortly after mid@@ day , and his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MPs out of the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the center of several front @-@ page stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night Programme , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy was to be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they are called to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are pil@@ ed within Labour , &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , to the position of the European Union and the limitation of winning .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour has proposed changes to remove the whole idea of a limit altogether .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hours later Mr Smith , the Shadow Labour and R@@ ent Minister said that the party was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it is only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he is T@@ ory boss , across the Dis@@ patch box over the last decade .
the Labour leader who promised another policy set says that he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30.000 ideas .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s frac@@ ture is too confron@@ t@@ ative , and that he is subjected to both &quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ality &quot; and stri@@ pping with re@@ tain@@ ers , instead of focusing on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economic minister will represent him if he does not participate , for example if Mr Cameron is on the road abroad .
he also discussed the idea that other colleagues occasionally spoke the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the under@@ house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy theatre , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s frac@@ ture . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the question of questions with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics argue they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and need extensive reforms .

pounds increase due to accelerated wage growth in the UK
the pound increased le@@ aps into data showing an increase in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel , FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ B@@ Miller building target .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and er@@ ased assessments of the time of an increase in interest rates since 2009 .
the pound increased by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed by 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 index ended with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the acquisition offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world , combining brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
according to encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures propose all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - again reported growth .
Glen@@ core shares rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken $ 2.5 billion by selling stock sales as part of his strategy of reducing debt .
the shares of the Packaging and Paper Group Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers in the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his assessment for the company R@@ ating on &quot; S@@ elling . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sports@@ wear company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says higher wages will je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se expansion .
the Managing Director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

the fans don &apos;t .
even Bi@@ eber himself is not .
this has taken care of anyway .
for the advertisement in the advertising break of the super @-@ user he paid three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ imp@@ le company , many , many dollars on the Bi@@ eber account .
and with each doll that looks like him and over the counter , Bi@@ eber also cas@@ c@@ ates .
if J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber drinks a coffee , you are astonished at the window pane .
he is said to have exploited more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e goes too far .
others stress that Bi@@ eber is just in the USA and UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; to No. 1 .
Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album will follow in November , is not interested in the many zer@@ os .
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA poster introduces Lebanese to potato d@@ ön@@ er idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
both - and indeed in the potato d@@ ön@@ er , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ ène Han@@ i Al@@ hay developed .
inspired by the word &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay has put potato and meat together on a sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he accidentally saw on TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then there is a barbecue sk@@ ewer in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; that &apos;s Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea was to have the Lebanese registered at the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
so how much meat and how much potatoes contain the sk@@ ewer , Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary understanding also comes well with its customers .
Met@@ cash starts Con@@ tra@@ diction Campa@@ ign to Com@@ bat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ ci@@ dents
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA branch from an al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a sustainability campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand I@@ GA through mainstream marketing and marketing over social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop owners who sell dis@@ counted tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish more details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler of food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor strategy day .
there is much in the game as South Australia and Western Australia make up nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern countries .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take about five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of its first markets and will take away sales of all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retail@@ er could lose $ 360 million per year and Met@@ cash 250 million dollars by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that in the next year , Al@@ di opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , and generated sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business , and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed @-@ cost basis , could cost around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found out that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley believes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in food and food business grow by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , while reducing market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told Melbourne that met@@ a will likely disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash declined to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the board of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
i@@ GA@@ S market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retail@@ er , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operative debt reduction with simultaneous pressure on sales and margins .
however , the wholes@@ aler resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million in order to equ@@ alize sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to enhance I@@ GA retail@@ er in improving their stores with fast growing fresh foods and to deliver a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s chief executive officer Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging refur@@ bish@@ ment programs to El@@ an are expected to grow and hopes that in 2017 the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis player Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ os and deserves praise for his own behavior according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , who is called &quot; Special K@@ s &quot; again and again , fell into the spotlight with the not@@ orious debate of Kyr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated by the refer@@ ee twice , and Har@@ rison proclaimed : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp s@@ add@@ led a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth at the second place in the singles behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I am rather proud about is the fact that after my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi was a bit dra@@ gged into the conflict , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a bat as he lost due to a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I think he was treated a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he &apos;s good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account Kyr@@ gy@@ os with the important decision on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed part to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Nick was very quick to reach out to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he climbs in the eyes of the public , and he has made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , I consider appropriate and it is best for the team and it is the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency situation , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency stand and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that tried to get illegal into the country .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Ser@@ b officials with rebellion .
the people who fled from violence had stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled down there .
but frustr@@ ations grew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ vers over them , the migrants cann@@ oned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people returned from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days , talks with Brussels and other countries must take place , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a con@@ ten@@ tious meeting in Brussels unable to reconci@@ le a common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the over@@ inking Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement was reached that the EU states would include more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit in the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a quick action from Brussels or its neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency stand , launched on Tuesday in two southern regions , gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could shut down streets and speed up asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after having ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison funds were used during the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and at the point of entry into the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) tall fence that the government had built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also specify higher sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares emergency condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which will be expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities had caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of commit@@ ting crimes under the new laws .
authorities are reluct@@ ant to repair the fence .
Hungarian officials also joined two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wag@@ gon arrived with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd to push themselves there .
about 20 people were able to arrive , but thousands of people remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l hal@@ ved
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race around the nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins over against the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced that he is candidate for the presi@@ dency , receives support from 15 percent of the voters of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the start of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determining which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphics groups , while S@@ anders earned a number of gains .
Clinton has a great lead among women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have decreased .
their support with the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clin@@ ton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters less than 50 years has van@@ ished , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , however , has a great lead among the older voters .
last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit gap in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the voters of the local elections say nationwide that they would support with enthusiasm Clinton if it were nominated by the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a quarter would support them with some reservations and further 15 percent would only support them because it &apos;s the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprisingly , that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about one quarter would support them enthusi@@ astically .
while 48 percent of the voters of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman president is ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
from Clinton &apos;s supporters , their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned .
approval to deal with the problems and the legi@@ bility are also quoted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the vice @-@ president raises the potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the voters want to see him in the race - even though a third believes he should not do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if democratic voters are asked for the election , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ ton &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to nom@@ inate the Democrats for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead is above S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure fell by 78 percent in the last month .
Bi@@ den is by far the second in this measurement , but the percentage that regards it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , in the question of what is more important with a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the vot@@ ability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similarly as in the last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for this election is unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important features in voters of the pre @-@ election of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den hon@@ ors the three candidates best with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinion of him .
democratic voters of the prim@@ aries generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ideological in accordance with their views .
for all of these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term of office are still being asked , most Democratic voters of the preliminary elections are satisfied with their declaration of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions .
but it is a different story in the American public all in all .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the email controversy had no impact on their general opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said their opinion had deterior@@ ated .
it is mainly re@@ public@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse .
although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters overall : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 62 percent of those entitled to vote do not consider them to be an honest and trust@@ worthy person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , 55 percent of voters across the country see Tr@@ ump as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good grades in leadership .
of the six candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders as honest , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the error ratio for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tr@@ ump in a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close to Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest news from C@@ BS News / New York Times
the two candidates now have half of the voters &apos; support in the new survey , and others lose dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month , by 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son fell from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump under Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten down with Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell down at the lowest , with 10 % support in the last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are 6 % in third place .
the error margin at the sample of 3@@ 76 people by Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week shows that Car@@ son is in the opinion poll@@ s - with 19 % support from the Republi@@ cans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent ABC News / Washington Post survey also showed Tr@@ ump clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising in the past week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ ump &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people don &apos;t go to the sea anymore : the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees in this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) divi@@ des .
bathing temperatures , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east , there is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic Sea it is 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood bur@@ dened with the death of Bar@@ uch College new@@ ings
almost two years after a student died during a religious ritual of a student association in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , mur@@ ders were lod@@ ged against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally during an introduction ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which has contributed to his death , shared the police with him .
officials said he had been bur@@ dened with associated eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go over a frozen field to a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about headaches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call on the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was im@@ potent and claimed an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ fy his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood in order to get advice , said police officer Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , members of the Brotherhood began to hide and set up the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ gra@@ f Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning in his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g was repeatedly added with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student died in the ch@@ ic@@ anes every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing the D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation .
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe advised a charge due to murder of the third grade for the first five members .
thirty and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of malicious attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to blame the persons involved , but if there is an organization that has - officially or officially - this has been sanc@@ tioned , we will also be accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College prohibited the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a rise in interest comes , and the house is falling down , yields for bonds will rise and the economy will slip into recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long this will last and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only little guidance on the process .
a recession occurred within only 11 months after the first rate of interest rate and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial systems react .
as a result , representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not concentrate when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period needed for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that the whole excitement could possibly be exagger@@ ated due to a net interest rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inevitably interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no impact .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things more volatile for a while .
as soon as the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that wealth yields may be reduced 12 to 24 months after the initial increase , which may reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what has happened after interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market is usually in upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days after ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the last six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a current analysis that published Bob D@@ oll , Head of plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return on return is beginning to decrease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases are often promoted .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that could not exist before and which could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point at a rate increase of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , nominal GDP had only twice the nominal GDP in 1950 below 4.5 per cent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If this time is different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants enjoyed the interest rate of the F@@ ed all year , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trade only gives a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all the increase cycles from 1950 to this day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing GDP growth and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ists were put in the shadows very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
the fixed income was also volatile as the market anticip@@ ates a rise in interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that bonds are faster than stocks when they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change direction once the first increase in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the increase cycle , the loan returns immediately fall , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to drawing closer ties between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a flat@@ ness of the curve .
high @-@ interest loans often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
it is interesting , however , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is flat@@ ter , bor@@ rowing has expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all features of the market when the F@@ ed ag@@ grav@@ ates its strategy .
in the large and large number of companies that engage in the larger part of their business operations in the United States , these will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt will get worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also financing their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate rise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet sur@@ passed an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a major problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose the most , said Gold@@ man .
outside of pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savers could see gains through higher income , even if experts in different opinions are how fast this will take place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says EP member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of Parliament critic@@ ised the sender for his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not to be distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they were only im@@ itated by The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins picked up The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , claiming a leading member of Parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private sen@@ ders do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; conserv@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew B@@ ingham &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also said to the BBC Bos@@ ses that the public radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evapor@@ ates &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is increasingly no longer distingu@@ ishable by its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be the Br@@ its only under a different name .
so , if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC general director rejected the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and education .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;m going to learn from classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 , finding new music and giving new works on behalf , I really think is important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that he needed to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sport was under fire to push the commercial ri@@ vals onto the feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - was &quot; produced in a special BBC way . &quot;
he added that he would like the company to &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house barn , &quot; when the next time there was an entertainment series .
however , he refused to exclude the order from further rows of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the fee @-@ chan@@ gers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales grew slower in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed the issue in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping cart has been bo@@ oted , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
but experts say there is now evidence that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase over the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back up to 2000 , this has always been developing over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began to buy their mobile purchases .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that is comm@@ uting , and we may experience that growth decreases .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the declining sales .
experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases in front of this event , held on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers went around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which buyers were fighting for bar@@ gain , could stop buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 spent a little more than 1 £ online .
in some products , such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of the purchases are now carried out via web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion stores in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca during the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims on the streets of Mec@@ ca by Muslims .
Saudi Arabia partially disman@@ tling the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane fell
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the victims being killed than a crane in Mec@@ ca &apos;s major mo@@ sch@@ ee collap@@ sed .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the track to pay their respect when the first of the dead occurred their last trip to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the procession passed on to the Holy Place , where only days before a tree ran through the ceiling of the mosque and then upon the worshi@@ ppers .
the bodies were released for burial , when the Saudi king informed about the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the catastrophe , which also left 3@@ 94 wounded , a san@@ ction .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 operators who were killed when a crane fell into Mec@@ ca by the Great Central mosque were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who had been on his first pilgrimage to support the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi officers have already firmly agreed that the H@@ add@@ sch will go on to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden group should not have stopped the arm of the crane when it was not used .
an Arab version of the decree released by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad was prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man was able to reveal what caused the overthrow of the crane , falling into an inner courtyard of the Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , who later took place this month .
the Bin Laden Group has not issued any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also bl@@ amed the group because of not up @-@ to @-@ date security measures and because it did not co@@ operating with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s major mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project managed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim .
officials said that 15@@ 8 people stay in hospital .
government officials ordered that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to the members of the killed were to be paid and the same amount of permanent injuries .
other wounded receive half of this amount .

it is alleged that Br@@ its lay their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of skilled East European arti@@ sans who carry out work in their home .
if you can handle a hammer or a brush for painting walls , you now seem to be a minority today .
the British employ more and more craftsmen to carry out do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ fers in their homes , such as the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the DIY chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe , offering services at low prices , is now over@@ hau@@ led .
therefore King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at craftsmen and close 60 outlets of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted more women to be in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions were hit by women .
at the moment the men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to face growing demographic trends that show more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this stronger towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured their top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that has exactly 50 percent of the team occupied with women , including its management and financial board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year earnings and sales , after the group owed the costs of closing the shops .
because of the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity before the court
on Wednesday , two officials of the Austrian volleyball @-@ runner A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and ev@@ asion .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of office .
he was convic@@ ted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process has been postpon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney @-@ General Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary investigation , the accused had cryst@@ alli@@ sed in the years 2006 to 2011 funds of club accounts on which they were allowed to disp@@ ose of their functions for private purposes .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports officials are also accused of financial years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact divided the chairman of the Sho@@ v@@ eller Senate , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
to the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence presented that the association was not at any time an asset .
the sports officials were only expecting expense damages and the sports club , for whom they had invested a lot of time and money from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities amounted to approximately 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 EUR ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time we stood before the situation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do we continue or block the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the defend@@ ants , in the bread @-@ profession of the finance office , said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants , he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , put our life insurance back as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during acceptance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , only no debt can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , with appropriate financial success , the withdrawal of the expense damages had been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , one part of the expenses were paid only years later , namely , since 2003 , when an asset has been in the account .
therefore , the former Ob@@ mann explained the proceedings as well .
the accounts and savings books shared the two defend@@ ants together , said the second defend@@ ant .
the judge asked why withdraw@@ als were not disclosed to the association in detail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association was not interested in the details of the financial system , but it was only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a function@@ ary investigation began in 2011 for office abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these were set@@ backs , the accused declared .
this bank account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant and , according to his statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know the answer for a long time .
then he finally said he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the public prosec@@ utor asked in the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claim of claims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why in@@ dem@@ n@@ ity ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first defend@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this formulation because the association had never been damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he had never obtained a cent salary , he merely calculated o@@ dom@@ eter money and diets .
he added 1.000 Euro per month to the association , but the actual expenditure would have been much higher , he added .
the accused did not present accurate records for the early years .
these were no longer kept after a company inspection , in which everything had been assessed correctly , they declared .
o@@ dom@@ eter money was also related to the second defend@@ ant .
all the de@@ port@@ ations were made in cash , so that he had to go to the Bank from his place of residence to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing will continue on September 23 with the questioning of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard reaches more 30.000 jobs
in addition to the staff cuts running for three years , the computer giant will disman@@ tle more jobs when split@@ ting the company .
the U.S. computer giant H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) finds no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
as a result , costs in the amount of $ 2.@@ 7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the step will lead to a special impact of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the exploitation of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP employed around 30@@ 2,000 employees .
in addition , the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share was 2.3 percent .
the Group of California @-@ based Pal@@ o Alto is currently split up : this is how the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new company , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC paragraph as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services replaced the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo recently .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers fell by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
as a result , revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with a split and massive sub@@ missions to the change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man responded very late to the fact that customers increasingly purchase smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and carry out more and more shops online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age a total of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflicts : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would , however , largely reject rejection : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 percent were con@@ sent@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that other states are flying air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent find positive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , 24 percent are in conflict with the conflict . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a cooperation with the Syrian authorities , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , reject 51 per cent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed , 20 percent would be .
29 per cent failed to decide .
car : second press day at 6@@ 6th IA@@ A
the focus of the fair is on the 27th of September , connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electro@@ mobility .
after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; Mobility &quot; on Thursday .
the wide audience can visit the IA@@ A from Saturday .
the organizers of the Auto @-@ Verband V@@ DA expect about 900 000 visitors two years ago .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : erup@@ tion of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water @-@ lights against several hundred refugees .
Euron@@ ews @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police , a police line had formed and a water@@ row@@ er was standing behind the polic@@ emen .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially set up pepper spray .
after that , the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have withdrawn from now somewhat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees gathered in themselves and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the press spokes@@ persons of the Serbian police have also suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US bank@@ note
the world ob@@ serves , when the US bank@@ note comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade , interest is raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of the opinion , was that the F@@ ed would continue to do so , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and hold interest rates at the current level of 0 to 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historic event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est put interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Managing Director at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a step are good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision will be announced at 20.@@ 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death protection at the Delta State University left ap@@ ology
after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleagues on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to tell him that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted to &quot; make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of geography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 am Monday morning
and he said he had shot on someone and killed someone .
lamb told the staff of the emergency call that police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , which will not distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller to his name , but he did not give him .
lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when the police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to undo it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen attacked him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ for@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that they were married for about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who was 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was their daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that Lamb called for relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He is not going to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police arrested him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in the spring of 2015 , Lamb received a doc@@ torate from the Delta State University , as his life insurance premi@@ ered on the University &apos;s website .
stars who lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 , he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer .
the actor also claimed to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession .
all this certainly demands its toll .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group
Lufthansa plans a large group restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
150 of the roughly 1000 executives around the world will be able to reduce the workplace costs .
there are meanwhile new negotiations with the pilot union .
the Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the cheaper eu@@ row@@ ings .
the objective of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to earnings of around € 500 million per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , announced the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , there is no longer a board of directors for the passenger business in the future .
the low @-@ cost airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the management team headed by Chef Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr .
with the new order , Spo@@ hr under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employee has been extremely complex .
the airlines operate under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the tari@@ ff conflict with the pilot association cockpit ( VC ) the negotiations after the deliber@@ ate strike on this Thursday are to be resum@@ ed .
this was shared by the union .
the theme of the talks is to be the retirement control for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a forec@@ asted record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit wants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve viable results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and the airline resulted in various strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional supply of the pilots , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savings concept is the background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the Lufthansa in the fight against competitor routes is reloc@@ ating to the Group &apos;s own equity line Eu@@ row@@ ings .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United cannot play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brought the left outdoor distribution to weeping and excluding him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w collap@@ sed into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being brought to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then plays fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy to escape a red card and the hanging of an elf .
Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbitr@@ ator was wrong .
you can judge for yourself when I say an el@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a tweet to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
referring to this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the UK Defender has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer said : &quot; it &apos;s a very serious injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the room with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a frac@@ ture when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ c@@ u said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball moving in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a F@@ oul@@ ding by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows the Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t last long before you know it by heart .
unless you &apos;re David Cameron perhaps .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental fa@@ bel published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or a message we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book , instead returns a summary of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if this would not be susp@@ icious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie presented on the Internet Movie Database site and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to being a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here , an un@@ named young , like the local environment by the gre@@ edy , trees , stum@@ bling , thri@@ ving Once @-@ ler hears , &quot; says the name of the trees , &quot; devast@@ ated .
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text had probably come from Cameron &apos;s electoral office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
to b@@ ump into Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the Ka@@ der who selected England for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not exclude a down@@ wards victory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Bat@@ ting setup , and the spirit spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack .
based on this , Adam Ly@@ th is leaving the UK test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course hard to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but tough reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , because - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate .
if he hopefully ki@@ cks out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there &apos;s another chance .
the England @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ lis@@ s praised his attitude , even if he did not get so good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test person gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick comp@@ ton received nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
the only accus@@ ation that can be raised was that England first settled Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer that I set up high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw early in Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very well .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this of course depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to beat mos@@ ques next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and get four Qui@@ cks , di@@ pped up , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious cri@@ cket player .
mos@@ ques may not have completed his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred re@@ ps straight away and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup sp@@ inn@@ s that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England has made some smart supplements at the training ground .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games , could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est strings of the game that will bring a wealth of experience as it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white sphere of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket contest , as a player or coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can profit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing room even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
collaboration with Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used with the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot got a similar break from Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team performers do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy by heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit from the UK from the EU ) could win on Zul@@ auf , if the economy is in a sl@@ ump by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ reported ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is going deeper into difficulties every day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought hard for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ at law recently said that some member states are so deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , such as the EU is now and not always on its own fault , Britain itself created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Ministers climb to summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who wishes a UK looking outside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets you see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials have come up to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious German Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as happened in the exagger@@ ated long endurance races such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right @-@ wing government , Spain a left .
it is hard to imagine that they will tear a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British whose energy is better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want because most of them have similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies .
therefore some such ministers even intentionally plan not helpful ann@@ ot@@ ations , quite in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process susp@@ ects my boy@@ friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they were during the refer@@ end@@ ums inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entrance in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can feel weak to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists who have made a name as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his dec@@ eption Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ gers , phone hack@@ ers , and the pseudo @-@ non @-@ foreigners who own most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought similarly about her , but noted that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you should be better distributed ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had put the principle on the un@@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 which opened a backdoor to him .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on the back of Westminster on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch Strategy of the 80 &apos;s , a mistake back then and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position in Europe is - I express it in a friendly way - in the development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people out of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional blue @-@ b@@ anning tendency and wild il@@ lic@@ it of Tor@@ ey Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said that Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell as a shad@@ ow@@ y was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; remain under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , what J@@ C told his comrades and MPs after all reports on their meeting on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even stir@@ red me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course like Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks that way .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege @-@ Economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son believes that J@@ C does not launch any campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be point@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I recall at the start on Monday of something called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critici@@ ze Public Health UK report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a government @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health UK ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month assumed the &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y foundation &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two further researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public anticip@@ ates that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on detailed verification of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) in order to lead their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received funding from British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T to Public Health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , they added .
the reasons for the selection of members of the committee are not delivered , but several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also include an industry funding in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also took part in the tobacco management of P@@ he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indicates that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or limitations will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; premature &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well@@ being at P@@ he said that BM@@ J was re@@ acted beforehand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes in comparison are low , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence proves and what not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
nearly 80@@ ,000 people die every year in a disease related to smoking and smoking costs the National Health Care System two billion pounds per year .
by providing clear evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ ers , says former CEO of Channel 4
the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard @-@ controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC general secretary , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that in his time at Channel 4 he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also clearly be shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee as part of his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the radio charge , what I don &apos;t think of a good idea in the medium or long term , one should at least put his production on programs that others do not do or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve as wide support as possible for their future .
the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax program is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ enders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
frank@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm for that .
I am obliged to see how this should be public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s inno@@ c@@ ence was based on the hunt for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular programmes give back what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , proposed in his Mac@@ tag@@ gar@@ t lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows how to sell East@@ ers .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfil their tasks , and they can argue when they go to their apparent sacred missions for justification of 4 billion £ of broadcasting , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee on the broadcast fee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you all think that one gets a great value for 150 pounds a year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 pounds , ask me if this is true because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also testi@@ fied before the Committee on Tuesday called for the BBC to verify their thi@@ an mission , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little from BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example to the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada , for example , to &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas like that of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful in television will be shown , and with the commercial channels Alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have cul@@ tured worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by break@@ outs of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des alter the direction at the moment in which they have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard , be@@ amed .
the impulses work by switching mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultras@@ onic waves .
further to this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms demonstrated the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , which can be used with ultrasound to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , a invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms usually do not respond to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with microsc@@ opic air bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ onic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified worms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applied ultrasound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ ves@@ icles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Hal@@ as@@ ani said Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which needs to be sent down to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; Chal@@ as@@ ani said .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

&quot; important announcement : drive from 15th to 18th September with the DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) one reads in the font types of the London Underground and the trademark of the DL@@ R line , which turns into the picture of a tank .

after Gav@@ in Gr@@ ind@@ on , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol Designs and Do@@ cent at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the public outside of galleries .
many artists join activists in protest movements to work and notice that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on society .

V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed by the silence that dominated the advertising campaign for the weapons show - by a laying of the Excel calendar - and thought : &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of real@@ istically z@@ wi@@ el@@ ich@@ y corporate advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the fade @-@ in with bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture equipment at the trade fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty .
what we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally from our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair comes from the area within Excel , where exhibitors think fantastic euph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student resi@@ dences
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ lasting complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be di@@ sti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entry into student residence ranges from slightly irrit@@ ating to absolutely sc@@ ary .
it is temp@@ ting to chat@@ ting : people tell wh@@ ence you come from , whether and where you &apos;ve taken sab@@ b@@ ati@@ cal year , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you don &apos;t love Mar@@ mite or hate because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your lashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people live .
people often turn into drinks recep@@ tions , film @-@ night venues and communal meeting points , but they are also the places where people dress up and put their under@@ wear on .
referring to this : do not remember to start with a relationship at the university
intro@@ vert will receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences are a space @-@ to @-@ space b@@ ypass culture that can be friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friend@@ ships .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get the energy back that I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted from convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send him a text message instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking apro@@ pos : do it .
a guy in my student resi@@ dences had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by che@@ eks .
as you start the university at the height of the back man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking at the doors of people to introduce yourself to a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I baked something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering home @-@ made goo@@ dies is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent bakery .
poorly mixed cl@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping when you start kno@@ cking .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check that with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to serve themselves even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , that is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a pur@@ ge to their milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise , keep people from sleep or work .
it is not just about being a decent person , but that you belong in the tru@@ est sense of the saying to the people sitting in the glass house .
a girl on my flight asked her neighbours if it makes them something to make Drum &amp; Bass a little qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with more loud music .
when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly left her neighbours to sleep two hours before she left her own music , closed her door and went to her three hour examination .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally enter the same student residence ?
on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be deeply embarrass@@ ing if you keep a room@@ mate for your future spouse , take care of them , separate themselves and then see them every day and perhaps experience how they pull together all together friends ?
of course the heart goes its own way - but if a hot co@@ habit@@ ant is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to persu@@ ade your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has left his keys in his un@@ locked room , the border between an ul@@ k and mo@@ bbing is more fin@@ er than it seems .
a good bar@@ gain is funny , but it only takes moments to get to the bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never chew@@ ing someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer - but stap@@ le their possessions on the ceiling more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single educ@@ ators , low @-@ ear@@ ners
the real estate company Markus Gil@@ dner builds in the Central Fran@@ con@@ ian corner ental terra@@ ced houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need housing space , but also the only educ@@ ating mother and the low @-@ ear@@ ners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and good today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are displaced in the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he is building terra@@ ced houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : mass housing in containers or gym@@ nasi@@ ums has no sustainability .
for people remain a great part here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the refugee flow , we also need enough housing in the next decades . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
guil@@ d : a row house needs least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different when one puts people in blocks .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say it is peace again , I go back .
then the houses can easily be rebuilt according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
guil@@ d : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without property .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
have the construction regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have dra@@ fted my project correctly .
especially complicated it always makes the threatening Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the parking lot ordin@@ ance .
in a nut@@ shell .
it is still under@@ estimated who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the towns there is a lack of space .
and refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
guil@@ d : there were those who accused me of creating luxury bodies for asylum seekers .
which is definitely not true .
but do you not exac@@ erb@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
guil@@ d : it &apos;s true : in the last five years we had a construction boom in Germany , but built luxury apartments that hardly can afford any more .
my project has the message , even the ordinary people need housing .
not only refugees , but also the alone @-@ educ@@ ating mother or the low @-@ ear@@ ners .
I show you how to build cheap and well today .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , typing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after the installation , as they receive an error message that tells you that the &quot; software update is missing . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the dele@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able by linking the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install them once the process is completed .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone may shut down half@@ way and this may lead to break@@ out of the update .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full Attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows in the battle for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full Attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup runner pointed out before the start to the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the runner @-@ up champion before the night race in Singapore on this Sunday from defending champion and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on already won seven of the twelve season races so far and also takes the floo@@ d@@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on won the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will affect Singapore &apos;s Grand Prix is still unclear .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
the chess club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; ( Chess Friends Bad Kis@@ singen ) , which was founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , so the membership number increased to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen on the cure .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bear@@ er of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has supported the Schach@@ club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , which President Alfred Klein accepted .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot impose the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent for talent should also be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town . &quot; &quot; &quot;
district Office seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new stop at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
in addition to consultations , you can also participate in courses .
the social foundation runs down from the mountain to the city centre .
more specifically to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , senior citizens and counsel@@ ors receive information on questions such as health insurance or health care insurance .
for years now , with our out@@ patient care service , we have established that often nursing relatives are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , many services of the insur@@ ances are not used , because the complexity of insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new owner Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the citizen hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health education and wellness .
to this end , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as tor@@ sion prevention , memory training or physio@@ therapeutic treatment can be used .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other perfectly .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city center sees both business leaders particularly in the demographic change .
because this makes a good decentr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual parts of Bam@@ berg in the future indispensable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation ceremony , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the association agreement : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular convi@@ vial gather@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes the social foundation a great contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 : 00 to 18 : 00 and Saturday from 10 : 00 to 12 : 00 .

Viennese architect Karl M@@ ang 92 years old
Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead .
he died on September 5th at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus shared on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with M@@ ang , the Künstler@@ haus left an honorary member and at the same time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as stated in the field of Foreign Affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna near Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War .
since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect , but was also active as a teacher , writer and institute director .
from 1972 to 1983 , he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design .
in the 1980s he was commissioned to set up the treas@@ ury in Vienna &apos;s Hof@@ burg and the reconstruction of the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ witz in the Austrian Theatre Museum .
penalty : Tim Wiese th@@ rows police officer with money
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ex @-@ foot@@ b@@ aller Tim Wiese was un@@ noticed in Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
once upon a time , Tim Wiese , ex @-@ Nation@@ alt@@ or@@ hü@@ ter in Germany and Bremen and H@@ offen@@ heim are involved , W@@ rest@@ ler .
according to his own statement , he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years .
on the other hand , he has not admitted intellectu@@ ally .
in the middle of the Bre@@ mer city centre , the meadow had just cut the hair when he saw out how outside a parking space gu@@ ardian presented a ticket for his white Chevro@@ let Cam@@ aro .
as a result , a meadow hur@@ led out of the business , insul@@ ted the be@@ amer and threw it in front of the feet , as the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper reports .
in the city of Bremen , one confirms the alle@@ gations , but it is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after that , I will decide whether the meadow will be displayed or not .

men beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were on the way from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one from the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , followed by the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was located at the height of the ft @-@ gas station .
there were also three people on the site of the petrol station .
one of these men now scre@@ amed the young man and struck the man with his fist .
the victim suffered a nose of nose and ble@@ ed strong out of the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the bat , he first departed from his sacrifice .
from his friends the injured young man was brought home now .
the perpet@@ rator followed the group with a passenger car to the apartment and drove there demonstr@@ atively several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the car any more , the injured man went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the bat and another male person .
the victim &apos;s face and the th@@ ig@@ h of the victim were checked with the help of a head@@ stock .
the injured had to be brought to hospital for medical care .
so far only a vag@@ ue bag description is available .
one of the men was approximately 1,80 meters large .
the second bat should have been about 1.@@ 65 feet tall and was clothed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police ask witnesses and references to report on the phone number 06@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller takes over practical field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , business promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor of Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy .
in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , have luck : there Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice field on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich finds his successor in half a position in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opened the practice on October 12 , until then he invested 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight when the field of rock met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently has completed their specialist training at the Ver@@ den hospital and also wants to enter into practice this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was time I just ph@@ oned them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea was to pursue its own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss .
and so it was agreed that the refuse owners bought the house with the practice .
they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there , the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller grew up , his medical studies in Hanover followed in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed a senior physician in the Di@@ ep@@ holz district and is involved in the DR@@ K @-@ willingness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19th , the practice for the new boss is being prepared .
while the surgeon is working as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ acional ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as a general practitioner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the endos@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load EC@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely re@@ done .
in the framework of a subsi@@ dy programme from the County ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) , the waste will be granted a subsi@@ dy of 50@@ 000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes Sam@@ son Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2,000 patients each quarter come into practice in the field of field breaks , in North German average practice it is about 500 .
there is another GP practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ ausen , the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor would have found it , she would have gone too .
if you visit Müll@@ ers speaking hour , inci@@ dentally also look familiar to familiar faces : take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power from the field .
with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all , the doctors have practiced for 30 years there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen was smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little sad@@ ness already sen@@ deth her after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the boarding school . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pushed myself in front of gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and is happy to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also on our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to put an asylum claim can do so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and security of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also clear that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , nor about the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled procedure .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wanted to leave incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and under certain circumstances establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
this is how the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia was already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to prevent its borders for refugees but not abri@@ dged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government shared , the first refugees had already tried to leave the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia to avoid registration .
the Croatian police were able to attack her in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik is constantly meeting police vehicles with new refugees .
it is mainly Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country hosts approximately 4000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo were diver@@ ted to the Serbian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously led migrants to the Hungarian border , reported Croatian and Serbian media unanim@@ ously on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it was the way people approach certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , in the morning , a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
via Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants had been on the road all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border with Serbia around 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has done so , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
in this way it could actually come to a somewhat further west route to the already predicted shift of the former Balkan Route of Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees corresponding plans for possible exceptional situations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call it details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you perform strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia has been a member of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently testi@@ fied to the country as far as the standard of border controls is concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Serbian side , some 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian interior minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm early on Wednesday at a local eye in Hor@@ gos : he held the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be about very high refugee numbers at this time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could not say whether they would continue their journey to Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area , 20 years after the end of the Croatian War , there are still un@@ cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine fighters was sent to the border region .
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber crime , which is accused of having provided an insight into yet un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; insi@@ der transactions on the financial markets should be made with the exploited information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were taken to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately trapped , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the processes against 32 other defend@@ ants in the case continued .
most of the accused come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetrators are said to have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe .
E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years

the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ remedy drew attention to its 20th anniversary with this action and is fully faced with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went into the city and people with the action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and discussions as the volunteer workers .
while some people spontaneously acc@@ use the chal@@ k and try to read the sentence &quot; my life be@@ j@@ ah@@ en , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; do not suffer long , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again on the ver@@ ge of small discussions about the action itself , about life , how to deal with death .
also Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I make it clear to me that at some point the end comes to this world , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic work Mannheim , which is co @-@ contracted with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband from the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Aid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why this public @-@ effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the fact that not everyone wants to express themselves on the tablets is understandable , but after all , it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death is still afflicted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening of the people .

F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial prospects lowered for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supply giant lowered its profit outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its bo@@ d@@ ship transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year , which will end in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecasts .
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower view occurs despite the price increases , which are average 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on the 4th of January and despite a higher rate for bo@@ d@@ ship transports of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result was increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and growth in online trading .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company produces &quot; solid income , considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , who plans to employ 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labour , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which predicted twelve analysts from Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales rose by 5 percent to € 12.@@ 3 billion .
analysts asked six of packs expected to $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipments , which brought sales in its unit of express shipping to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , turnover increased by 29 per cent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result decreased because of higher labor costs in the freight business .
in the pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0,@@ 15 .
on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on its most anticipated conference in the year , Federal Reserve Strate@@ gies spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the Lei@@ tz@@ ins for the first time for almost a decade .
a wall picture of the United States is located at an end of the adorned , two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed sitting room .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed Chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the nation &apos;s economic interests in front of all other things .
the Central Bank has a two @-@ fold mandate from Congress : maxim@@ izing US employment and prices here stable .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be re@@ conc@@ iled by the unprecedented incentive by the close to zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data from the economy show that it grows solid , recent tur@@ mo@@ il on the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxious to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising interest for federal securities - and be it only by a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they watch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the estate agency Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which in itself uns@@ ett@@ les the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists , who were recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , predicted an increase in interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the strike by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average le@@ aped by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the set this week , said John Lon@@ ski , head econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a net interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
even a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in the spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the sentence expected .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed , the improvement in the labour market this year was solid .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level seen by the F@@ ed as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macroeconomics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world drew together at the end of the last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average figure fell by more than 16 % in May , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , and the D@@ ow is now nearly 10 % below the peak of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation , when one should increase interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would put the re@@ ins in this session , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the US bank@@ note . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get the impact on the grip better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the global economy is not the main concern of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in the decision making process .
but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mere hint of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; narrow down their monetary expansion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caused confusion around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also rely on other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their decision making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , noted this month that &quot; F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that apparently are not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
acqu@@ er , approved member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who advoc@@ ates interest raise , made decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its benchmark interest by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited noticeable effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lack@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives were revers@@ ing these cuts .
the F@@ ed should focus on aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the fall of the market 2008 to the first place , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on interest @-@ fixing of Bank of England .
the recent turbul@@ ences do not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest because markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t think it should ha@@ sten the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life aid for refugees
more and more refugees come to Germany these days .
to prepare a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
among them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
even with her 74 sequences , she still likes to teach .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seek@@ er at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , this is quite different teaching than at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s pedi@@ atric society Rio Grande fo@@ sters nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pap@@ al organization SP@@ RS attempts to clarify how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . she does this with the presentation of images of babies who are painted on breasts that are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by around 500 calories a day .
however , new research suggests that higher cal@@ oric intake is not the only dietary supplement that mothers should undertake .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet in pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction contract for the 2.3 million Euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be flat@@ ter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awaited Turn@@ halle building at the Bern@@ ese Sports Field is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent assembly session , the elabor@@ ated building application was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the committee had decided , among other things , an application for a structural &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the valid construction plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; there was permission for a special form regarding the roof structure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ och@@ ial first and roof over@@ hang &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar installations : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , we get a wonderful large south roof together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again about the roof til@@ ting , which for energy reasons - differently than stipul@@ ated in the construction plan - should lie below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the construction plan permits no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the rule of the roof - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council usually drives rather restric@@ tively in the case of liberation applications . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in gymnas@@ tics , however , it is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym@@ nasi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a community project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros have been calculated at the expense of costs .
subsidies are expected from school and broad@@ band sports .
in the next step the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall will be presented to the Land@@ rats@@ amt .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg Hospital is planned to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes a new medical director at Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of the employees pull from P@@ ei@@ der@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the Land@@ kreis district of the county , which confirmed the land@@ lady Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , September 23 .
should the plans be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 staff at the Hospital in P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg would be busy .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with fis@@ her and the further inside station .
rooms are available .
the employees who do not have access to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss .
the employees are informed of the plans .
Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year , has now switched to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead starting October 1st and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means in every case a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer special@@ ises in pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years fis@@ her with his team , if the supervisory board agrees to the agreement , will lead both houses until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ en@@ schaft , which has more than 35 beds , is to be finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the county had planned this for 2018 , when the current renovation was completed at Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital .
Land@@ rä@@ tin J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house which is owned by the federal government will be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what I conclude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss has not been able to say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a conference psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the Qu@@ asi Mo@@ ving to the Le@@ ch , which was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understandable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years has not been given .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg Hospital ( once 100 beds ) has always been threatened by closure in recent decades , departments have been closed , such as surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the hand legs of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are demanded tonight at the Berg@@ ischen HC tonight ( 8.@@ 15 pm ) .

Jag@@ ü@@ elo with two injured in Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been severely injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Wit@@ tenberg ) several hunters were in use as the police shared .
after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear at first .
the police investigated .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of crimes of violence
the police for the cor@@ pse of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate have led the police to the cor@@ pse of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old .
in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the youths were killed and their bodies thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who had been missing for Saturday , fell victim to violent crimes .
the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office and the police .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was arrested on Tuesday evening , was also considered to be the suspect and led the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after they didn &apos;t come home after a visit of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
when searching for a young woman , investig@@ ators first met on personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the case of interro@@ gations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpet@@ rator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ pse was found .
according to the authorities , the police interro@@ gated the police interro@@ gation of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ pse in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be brought to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators lay a burden on him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; information about the closer circumstances of action should bring further investigations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees need accommodation : study warns against housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for an affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction is facing a challenge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
with the incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built every year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sozial@@ er housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison : this year , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany .
this means that there are 14@@ 0.000 apartments .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial residence .
many then come across the housing market and join the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , less than half of all asylum seekers lived in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes considerable savings in the housing development policy of recent years .
Germany is pushing a housing shortage in front of itself , which gets bigger from year to year .
currently , around 77@@ ,000 residential units have already been missing in the con@@ ur@@ bation areas , compla@@ ins Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore dwelt in large cities in need of WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed longer in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the noise on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has declined again for the first time in recent years .
in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; social housing construction &quot; proposes a restart .
in doing so , new incentives should boost social housing .
thus , the property tax could be wai@@ ved and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats could be temporarily suspended .
in addition , attractive tax write @-@ downs are necessary according to the Alliance .
the funding programme for shel@@ ters of the state bank Kf@@ W is already well received by cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , with 18@@ 4 million euros , more than half of the approximately 300 million euros have been rec@@ alled on Monday evening .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free travel : Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
there is practically no escape to Hungary , as more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia .
Zagreb announces the granting of transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
however , the route is dangerous though .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian Interior Minister and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the extermination of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have been broken down to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian broad@@ caster RT@@ L .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws that entered into force on the same day also make decent asylum procedures in Hungary superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
but there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police took up the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to Croatia on the morning .
most of the media reports have been reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came with the bus as well as with taxis in the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border , the refugees do not meet the border f@@ ences .
this poses other dangers to the border crossing : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
mine clearance is to quickly create a safe passage .
meanwhile , after the closure of the border , almost no more refugees come to Hungary .
on Tuesday the police numbered 3@@ 66 attacked people .
shortly before the closure on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws contain the overcoming and damage of the border between us as a crime .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
condemned to prison sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , there were 94 asylum applications in the newly established &quot; Tran@@ sit@@ onen &quot; on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there would have been 40 refugees there .
practically no one has a prospect of granted asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there .
just a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected garbage that tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side in recent weeks .
lock screens were disman@@ tled and one of the recording managers in the border area was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express himself for the purpose of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria reached only a few refugees .
in addition , the country has strengthened its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants were still in the country according to the government &apos;s instructions .
in Salzburg , some 1400 people wait for the continuation to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by order of German authorities .
smaller groups of refugees arrived in Frei@@ las@@ sing on foot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mayor drove &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; str@@ anded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; across the border &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge festival on Sunday , when ten people suddenly stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly hired railway traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the border together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the near Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we used the unexpected guests only once , with snacks and drinks .
we said the same , we bring them to Passa@@ u by car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was self @-@ evident for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man didn &apos;t let him take a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers were switched to a regional train in W@@ els by an ICE into a regional train in direction to Passa@@ u in order to see it after the short notice that railway traffic was stopped to Germany , but still trying to cross the border .
however , the regional train was set off before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest connected with the Bavarian neighbours on sun@@ day , a two @-@ b@@ ump @-@ race before , organised by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends other tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in the construction of structures that guarantee humanity , our Federal Chancellor has publicly revealed the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; landed country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge in the face of the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter , to create decent conditions for shelter @-@ seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ resistant districts
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad has to do all his hands full of fle@@ eing with the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad is accustomed to having his word weight .
the government used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to place quarters for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first training centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday would be without great fuss , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master power &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all in all , Konrad reck@@ ons with a requirement of 8@@ 5,000 copies in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , more than 35@@ ,000 units will have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to provide the federal states , 15,000 of the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial governor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would have assured him of creating neighbour@@ hoods even for the coming refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it runs well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ar supports Konrad .
tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , which will be clari@@ fied as the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator also places great expectations in the ORF promotion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Help like us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are vac@@ ant in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in times of emergency , it cannot be that quarters en@@ co@@ ders must respect a certain amount of the towel holder or the size of the duties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Interior Ministry , he was more successful when accommod@@ ating , Con@@ rad founded his experience .
I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of the truth .
belief is his most important weapon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause costs for the Republic as they themselves stated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees on three to four .
so far , its own quest for accommodation has not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with hom@@ olog@@ ation .
Linz calls for a better division
for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as the affected persons are currently unable to take these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
however , further locations should be tested for emer@@ gen@@ cies for emer@@ gen@@ cies .
criticism is exer@@ ted by the chief of the city in the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts also have to contribute to this .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a long phone call with Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday ordered further action in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders were not sealed off .
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible .
however , there is now the appropriate border controls .
for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will not give it any more .
however , the guards would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria now also carries out controls on its borders is a logical consequence of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general san@@ itation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Verk@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz industry line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is drawn up , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in the start @-@ up companies of the New Wer@@ ft , and later to acquire some of them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the Land of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building has been le@@ ased from Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square foot rest area in the building are already rented out , for another 40 percent there are en@@ quiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second business in the Arctic
in the new shop ven@@ eer hand@@ bags are the centre of attention .
in fact , Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve market ar@@ cade : after all , she has now gained growth in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , in which they sell bags , bags , shoes and clothing of different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around Dam@@ en@@ Hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are starting from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously it was rebuilt several weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long been thinking about opening up a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location in which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in Greater Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who herself has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has put her fashion interest in the cra@@ dle of her mother .
I am most interested when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why some woman , looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , can also not answer the professional woman with last safety .
maybe it &apos;s because a nice bag will enhance every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called an@@ gl@@ ers .
this feature also connects some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ sets .
whether it expresses itself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , journalist is concerned or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis politics - the candidate for the US presidential office is bu@@ stling for the campaign .
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate market come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öhn@@ fris@@ ur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term for many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine road . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant place is related to it over -@@ ty corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ t Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a movie about Tr@@ ump .
and what do villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find this exciting , but are not so pro@@ found@@ ly impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt art , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ t has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous children , to which besides Tr@@ ump also the Ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also to Word - so with the statement that he would surely also be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the family &apos;s performance , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; accidentally loud the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to High German : the An@@ ders , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and in the USA opened a place for gold dig@@ gers .
the foundations of the real estate company were first real estate sales in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to home in the long run failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump because he was once cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ atine History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared film start .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descend@@ ant .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; as pol@@ lin@@ ated , it &apos;s not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ ump ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement fores@@ ees the Americans rather dis@@ soci@@ ating , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so br@@ ushing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he think that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension land@@ lady Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm mentioned as many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of Heinz &apos;s family donated something for the church organ at a visit , which was generally good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they would find it better if he didn &apos;t know the election , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ ws at the time of his grandfather in the United States would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ emaker Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not my president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wen@@ dels &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , also in the US w@@ akes up interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavaria municipality Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 1800 @-@ inhabit@@ ant village of Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday from the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing villages &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the neighbouring country the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have more than 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protective area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son hurry to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has not been any major shifts in today &apos;s ratings .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broadcast by the state capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a one @-@ week series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the resistance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , because Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators at the five main cities , compared to today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , Today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed in recent months .
in August , today , an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the gap between 40,000 and 50,000 took place .
up to now in September Sun@@ rise stands at 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning men more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former seri@@ ousness of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father who decides to settle with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ter Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and easily hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17.@@ 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored 44@@ ,000 spectators on average .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour was 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the Qu@@ otes of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a substitute for a million dollars minute that failed to over@@ ride Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor .
the woman who finally ends at Sam Wood in The Bachelor was sh@@ rou@@ ded in sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who has received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows on the day before out of three two , you may have accidentally given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood holds his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have left themselves ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; could their answers become a gam@@ ut who won the b@@ achel@@ or &apos;s heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everyone named Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
the first day Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship with each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed S@@ ams energies , I felt they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood were well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home visit last week made her clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be one &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally adjusted to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zzling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the lef@@ to@@ ver girls equally - it &apos;s a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the b@@ achel@@ or will be broadcast on 10 on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have banned Hay@@ nes for the rest of the game as he lost a pole as he did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ ver@@ ts at his first pun@@ t return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his man and gave Hay@@ nes the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also into the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a also publicly strengthened Hay@@ nes in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ dn was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his missed catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t , which was restored in the first game district of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ nes and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ nes left the playing field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine any worse start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ dn made the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 when a passport took place in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .

the Free Elec@@ tors demand the hi@@ ring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high refugee numbers .
party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W Aut@@ umn Conference in Groß@@ Wall@@ stadt before a severe crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , when there are not new teachers in line with the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get compensation in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the open constitu@@ tion@@ aries of the Free elec@@ torate postpon@@ ed until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian commun@@ e .
actually quite different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free Elec@@ torate @-@ Meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lay the c@@ law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded the establishment of UN protective zones for refugees in Syria , as existed during the Yugoslavia war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we must go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Elec@@ torate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one the free elec@@ torate as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded more personnel for the administrative courts responsible for asylum seekers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W leader critic@@ ised that several states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards of federal states in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria sli@@ ps off , others don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more efficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the state policy in the Greater Wall@@ stadt should not fall under the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a long lasting burner has been on the agenda : the policy of education . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the new school year , the Minister of Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; Inter@@ mediate plus &quot; at 47 gym@@ nasi@@ ums in which an extension of the secondary school level from three to four years will be tested .
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber levels on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal after the police flew into a crowd against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ expan@@ i district , 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ hak@@ al , senior district officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside of a police station , and some of them threw stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ hak@@ al said that the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resor@@ ting to rubber missi@@ les .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber floors , which are known to be able to kill , which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces that are formed within the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th century .
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial topic in Nepal that has been ruled central for centuries .
working on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legislature accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional draft in Kathmandu , and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the plot at Em@@ den Youth Centre Old Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market around 4000 square meters of land in the direct vicinity of the Youth Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
it is planned to use the premises for a mixture of trade , commercial and living .
one is waiting for appropriate offers , it is called by the city .
which investor question comes , is not yet clear .
no contracts were concluded accordingly .
the town of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which is located on the ring road / corner of Große Straße , already several months ago and the building on it can be torn down .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning of the holiday settlement on the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor publicly presented plans for the project for the first time .
some An@@ gli@@ eger are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure fu@@ gi@@ um
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for months the door closed behind closed doors , g@@ ag@@ ged , deb@@ ated , and drawn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday settlement on the Small Sea close to Em@@ den on the table .
the stak@@ eholder , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; System @-@ Bau , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the City Development Committee of the Em@@ press Council .
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , which repro@@ ached the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ esch proc@@ eeded from the system construction management to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to meet all rum@@ ours now .
the ten to twelve million euro project has been in the discussion for months .
violent reactions among sea owners who had come to the meeting called out the pictures and new details about the desired hotel construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , marine owner and member of the board of advoc@@ acy of the An@@ gli@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z that over@@ looks all other bones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears like many other project critics that the traffic would increase due to the planned size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be whole bus loads , so that it pays off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , what happens exactly on the well one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends .
because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans are still variable .

Google launches dou@@ bling donations campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ donation campaign that aims to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have rolled over the European nations , as they flee from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google has an unusually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donations call on his blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of making a manager announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee , who had fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark web and bus rides , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but as the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing aid to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global funds raised to $ 5.5 million will be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven over 4 million people this year .
many also fled from the war @-@ torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily overweight diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new trial .
it &apos;s still too early to tell if slightly obes@@ e people live longer with diabetes after weight loss surgery longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery .
weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity operations for type 2 diabetes have proven to be efficient , but most studies have been performed in people who are obes@@ e obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity - stomach b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c shr@@ ink@@ age - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those who underwent this operation fell from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatment approximately immediately at 29 .
among those undergoing a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes condition was completely dis@@ integrated and 28 % in part .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , in comparison with the diabetes , the diabetes was completely only at one percent and partly with only about two percent .
in addition , the results of the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood glucose level of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical treatment group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mortality in five years , the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results with the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater decreases in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported rather a complete overcoming of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit after five years , there are indications from a study of heavy people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who underwent obesity , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was re@@ ass@@ uring for people with a BM@@ I of 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have attached their bodies to obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story takes place in H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a topic that is becoming increasingly respected in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly at school times , meets the flock of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time writer grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take all refugees , said the Dalai Lama , and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries to the refugee crisis was ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation was not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed .
ultimately , we need to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 , and found out that the violent reaction of the United States resulted in a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of consumption of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the past 4 years
poison control centres in the US report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , which swallow strongly alcoholic hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of recei@@ pts of disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years reported to report toxic control centers , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them lands in the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children were deliberately drinking disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a test in social media .
videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants just because of a cheap experience .
te@@ ens allegedly mixed dis@@ infection with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very attractive for children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
even small children can already lead a few spra@@ yers to alcohol intoxic@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the poison not@@ ebook centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sy@@ ringe from after straw@@ berry sm@@ elling @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was brought into an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is considered to be drunk by an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency doctor , treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah le@@ aned her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on the signs of Hir@@ n trauma , as the girl was fallen by alcohol and had met his head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store hand des@@ infection products out of reach of the child .
in addition to alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario following the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January three students of the fourth class in the State of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by expos@@ ing anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them from her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the disgu@@ ised plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland there are no highlights of the Celtic games anymore and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s because the ran@@ gers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of R@@ angers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic has to fight , but the Norwegian leader s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 men from Aber@@ deen was followed by a five @-@ point lead clear at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had already bad times before and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this way - but we have to go on .
we really need the support from Celtic , because that makes the players better .
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ ti@@ ously at January transfers
despite his commentary a few weeks ago , which pointed out that he was ha@@ sten@@ ing for some January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious about signing new entran@@ ts and insi@@ sts that he does not want to interfere with the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x cad@@ res .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January Transfer Window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players who come in summer have this season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group of this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic @-@ target person Mik@@ u with a check back
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period , indicated that he could withdraw if his contract exp@@ ires at the Sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has pla@@ gu@@ ed himself with a troubles@@ ome k@@ nu@@ ckle for two years and has not made the departure from Wales this summer .
heard on S@@ FA battle due to N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s comments
the Hear@@ ts took 2 : 1 , when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent out of the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of the Defender was later aboli@@ shed - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son stays with what he said and insisted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have no power commented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le
the un@@ corrected Hi@@ bee was corrected after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive texts about ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the Ros@@ eb@@ urn area of Edinburgh before a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the stor@@ mer , and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is certain to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tan@@ na@@ dice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s board of directors still has confidence in the management team to turn things - but admit that the decline in the field must end .
I think that Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back to Tra@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es glad to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; win &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Hamilton . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team from Aber@@ deen desper@@ ately needed to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cies to win a seventh consecutive League victory that brought them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no crew who won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues that won &apos;t win games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , as it increases in the UK overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as shown by the numbers of the National Statistics Office ( ON@@ S ) .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken disrup@@ ts the exp@@ ir@@ ation
as security personnel could not be able to paci@@ fy the situation , the staff called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray , the officials could take the stor@@ ks into custody .

why I am witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope that it is not happening , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison inj@@ ector .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applications available than places to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps close friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been better form@@ ulate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to write there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kim Bell@@ y@@ ware , a re@@ porter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here again .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary .
but I believe there is a strong chance that he is not guilty of murder .
I am sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters to which you can turn to it .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die of unnecessary death .
man after wet police persecution persu@@ aded to come out of the c@@ anning river
the c@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman was dry when he talked to the man of the c@@ anning river .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to susp@@ end the police was un@@ successful when he found himself in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , just a few meters from a police officer who tried to &quot; persu@@ ade him to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were sum@@ mon@@ ed to a break @-@ in incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , they tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he didn &apos;t get too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ vec was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he applied a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polish is negotiated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ ing@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
master football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the dit@@ ches to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threaten to finish racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the Integ@@ rit@@ ä@@ ts division of Racing Victoria and claimed that they performed a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what was best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobal@@ t @-@ tasting at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had with@@ held 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age alle@@ gations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know it went on .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk up@@ lifted heads , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more coaches .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously , Moo@@ dy had uploaded the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him an occupation in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy to rac@@ ing@@ .com .
they obviously believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if this is the case , they should surely touch their n@@ oses because they failed in trying to write me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , President of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today .
should this happen to me that it becomes personal ?
has the R@@ V@@ L beha@@ ved cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people responsible outside trainers for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now let them reflect on it .
but I am now at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have been set up with the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t investigation in Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to the fact that he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s bill , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my co @-@ workers has er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously applied mud to the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been like last night .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so .
but it was also so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy may be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the day of the race . an investigation of this matter has been opened .
it &apos;s a joke .
people who set up these rules don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes against ri@@ vals due to claims to ring fighting
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kling of its players as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rators allowed the Storm @-@ players &apos; ring struggles &apos; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a scarcely concealed remark on the Storm team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in rings .
Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said they were concentrating only on their &quot; contact &quot; at the Tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team was confident that they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes up again and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about w@@ rest@@ ling when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that in the whole year we have not changed our def@@ en@@ sive system or techniques . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real focus , and this has provided us with the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not used to losing so it was a bit a shock for him .
it &apos;s funny how this always emerges again at this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy ass@@ aul@@ ted Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the premi@@ er league in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he &apos;ll take care of a divorce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as they can .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm versus R@@ oo@@ ster achieved a higher score than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks and there are no points at all ?
for me it &apos;s the game plans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they mention us , it means that we will come to them in a phase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Storm team released this weekend , as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday evening at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bians with $ 200,000 security deposit after drug delivery
a man who possibly threat@@ ens a life @-@ long punishment because of his attempt to get into the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested for the last month after the German police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the yacht port during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for attempting to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the cafe could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the risk of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ ant declarations of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone won &apos;t be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he gives off his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports to the police daily and to a cur@@ few at 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 at Karlsruhe : cab breaks apart
a truck driver was severely injured during a collision with three trucks on the highway 5 at Karlsruhe on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to escape in the last moment to the left , as the police informed .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ induced man tore apart completely .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .

St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone from girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a gir@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg accepted the girl &apos;s phone as this was asleep , logging into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of in@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping testi@@ g .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately alert her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web searches that used words to search for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed that he did it as it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be a addi@@ ct - that he is addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that searching on the computer was carried out by him , but said that it was happening because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and which he asked to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said that he would then see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying .
she then saw the un@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty on the basis of the indictment , to have taken up in@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year , to be viol@@ ated against the editions and not to appear before the court for a hearing on 24 March of this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defense attorney Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg would not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders because they could argue that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be found in his transgres@@ sion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to get background reports on social work .
Ho@@ gg was granted the deposit in this case , but was held in custody for hear@@ ings to other pending cases .
he was admitted before the date of the judgment in the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
bad users switch to Germany on small border cross@@ ings
more and more refugees are taken up away from the major control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many fla@@ ws caused fear of discovery and arrest the people increasingly at smaller border cross@@ ings .
on the Austrian side , a spokesman of the Federal Police said .
along the border river Inn , more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the district of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they had come to the German side on foot over bridges and bushes .
there they are received by federal police officers and for@@ warded to the registration .
according to Federal Police figures at the Munich Main Station , more refugees arrived once again compared to the start of the week on Wednesday .
there were around 700 people in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 o &apos;clock , a spokesman said in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , the city reached 17@@ 59 refugees on Tuesday .

the mass makes it : every two years , the car makers at the IA@@ A show their novel@@ ties .
in 2015 , there is a lot of movement among the compact cars that are currently being sold very well .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the Federal Office of Motor Transport ( KBA ) in August alone in August .
this is also reflected at the IA@@ A ( Public Days of 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , many new compact models will be presented between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at dealers in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive .
Rüssel@@ sheim / Germany . Opel has an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offer further diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also include three @-@ cylinder petrol engines for the first time .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only available as a five @-@ door model .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is already visible at the IA@@ A .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IA@@ A ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra rival Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can only be seen as a fifth in a conventional and a distinc@@ tly sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes next year , then also as a com@@ bo .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan boom wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications at 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
the launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not entirely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which is visible at the IA@@ A .
on the outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers laid hands on the front part : here the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time with Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
in addition , at the IA@@ A in the compact class there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the new Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are decent
the Federal Constitutional Court has been entitled to an ex @-@ prisoner of the At@@ tor@@ ney @-@ General Te@@ gel which was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally .
after that , the man who is now on the free foot according to his lawyer has been transferred to a larger cell .
his position of office because of the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the Land Berlin failed .
however , the Constitutional Court raised the verdict of the Chamber of Appe@@ al of Berlin and transferred the case back to the trial .
they see man &apos;s dignity hurt .
Kammer@@ gericht will now decide on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of liability for compensation were decisive for the compensation , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a deterioration of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chamber court must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of imprisonment .
so they spoke to a prisoner of damages only in April because he was locked naked in a cell .
according to a decision of 2011 , a decision of 2011 is also the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had agreed to an in@@ decent housing in a parallel event in November 2009 .
the then pla@@ inti@@ ff was lod@@ ged between 15 to 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also come to the head@@ lines due to missing personnel .
det@@ ain@@ ees are therefore always included in 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to ra@@ ckets should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Justice Press Office , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of young talent , 19 should fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
according to the German Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany according to the report by Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated decisi@@ veness in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do that and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
according to various progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Building ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) flats are used every year - the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as has been built so far ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental properties : 60@@ ,000 up to 80@@ ,000 social apartments annually fall out of the rental price , and these particularly favorable apartments will also apply for refugees .
Federal Construction Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing would have to arise every year , and the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , scientists and federal mini@@ stries agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Institute for Employment Research ( Institute for Employment Research ) , 55 percent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualification to help them get started , Claudia Walter critic@@ ises project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial to find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the intake society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political turn@@ around : from the ban on labour for refugees to recognise work .
whereas there was a ban on employment for asylum seekers from up to five years earlier this period was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as is the residence requirement that the asylum seekers are confined to a place of residence .
in society , also because of the shortage of skilled workers , the view of the labour market should be made easier by the shortage of skilled workers .
the lack of German knowledge is a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market .
up to now there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
for this reason , the structure of networks is based on Thr@@ än@@ hardt the Königs@@ weg for work integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few escaped parents give their children to the kit@@ tens , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the un@@ rooted parents it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ esch@@ bacher , spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in various languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators is rising sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more specialised schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of the German language will be prepared to receive welcome classes .
they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ags from the Berlin school administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that approximately 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal state prohi@@ bits asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , Interior Minister Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has given up his attitude now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; student willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for refugees with a residence permit or Dul@@ ce do not receive any benefits after the asylum seekers Act when they start a study .
the latter generally do not get a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to af@@ ici@@ dal persons .
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 to shor@@ ten this span to 15 months .
but this gap also needs to be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches have , and the existing state church right to develop a new state @-@ religious relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare organization , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
the rights also include duties .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree to clear contact persons and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and give him some control options .
this also includes the willingness to fight against religious fundament@@ alism .
the President of the Council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried in to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to stra@@ y such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he suggested to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
in the future , integration will be much more than today an issue of the whole society .
in this way , the majority society will also have to change , the degradation of discrimination and racism is more pressing .
indeed , Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination and universal equality law for a decade .
but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U series of mur@@ ders showed that the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and stakeholders do not require for a long time , and what international treaties such as the anti @-@ racism Convention of Germany commit , must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical assistance to the previously expected refugees , according to the Medical Association Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for some power and capacities , we create this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must be incorporated into the system .
in order to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery demands to hand out all newcom@@ ers right away when regi@@ stering health cards .
services rendered may later be deduc@@ ted from the federal states .
and in the long run it is highly question@@ able to send as many people with the limited range of services that the asylum seekers Act prescri@@ bes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , the doctors are mainly making the language barriers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are more aware of their disease than other patients .
not only in clinics , even in medical sur@@ geri@@ es , interpre@@ ters would have to be taken over , it demands .
many refugees have also been helped by more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
in the case of refugee children , there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities , and in the young people it is about HIV @-@ enligh@@ tenment .
with some of the other diseases , German doctors come from their training , but it is clear , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medical don@@ ki &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the refugees may even see relief in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed educational system , some refugees are even doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to be allowed to practice , however , they need to prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill after estimates of the Bundes@@ psycho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially vulnerable are refugee children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recent study conducted by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer from so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart@@ beats and death thro@@ es .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
up to now only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees have received psycho@@ therapy .
while psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers in the social offices can provide an application for psycho@@ therapy , the treatment usually lasts several months .
in addition , in the social offices mostly non @-@ cash workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to attract each age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream in the Man@@ ege on a brick .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ hr@@ erin and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - this is the motto of the current management stage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years the Circus is in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift to enter@@ tain@@ ers is thus in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to pick up people from their everyday routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience cocktail with world @-@ city flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst its concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme convin@@ ces with talented artists from all over the world .
excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent films the Cuban duo wants to easily record them .
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is supposed to conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and arti@@ stry .
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He Yu@@ an .
snake @-@ men are fascinated and frigh@@ tened at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics , like little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ies Mutter , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if our animals are not good , it doesn &apos;t work well either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each match unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are lovingly called , will be read out by the eyes of every wish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the man@@ ege .
so the first commandment : good for the animals .
especially on their zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra @-@ stu@@ b , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is still not ready for the Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether five or more 200 spectators , we always do our best and are with all the heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites every day from 17 to 20 September at 17 and 20 o &apos;clock .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced .
the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open every day from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread over social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by claims from members of the opposition that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them to join Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last month , they had rested him and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokesman of the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it warns the Parliament members that immunity will end in parliament and as soon as they leave parliament its parliamentary immunity is no longer effective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard to build up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs during restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
this year HP will split up into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and services business activities .
the anticipated job cuts lead to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ president and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is HP today , and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses supporting businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be focused on delivering unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by graduates from Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to manufacture electro @-@ systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage was called &quot; the birth@@ place of Sili@@ con Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to manage the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the belief that closely focused businesses perform better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ate must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb , behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation progres@@ ses according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , its participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain .
the great shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old cur@@ l during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone which doesn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was only an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger recognised , there is the associated risk of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of arsen@@ als 15@@ 7 league games in the last five times .
the broader picture for Arsenal is that they were in six out of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs which have recorded most of the injuries .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsenal believes that there will be an improvement in the injury rate during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a due time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain combat force , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career that he deserves .
arsen@@ al begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , meaning that Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players who need it to take a little break @-@ break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although arsen@@ al is clear favour@@ ites to pass through Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , measured on the Richter scale 3 : 2 .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that arsen@@ al has pulled the lesson from the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco and is driven by far hope to lead the association to its first European victory with its management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al has never worked out .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show that gave us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever before , such as suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Campa@@ ign against a miserable life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to question the men to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the cent@@ er@@ piece in the fight to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms confirmed that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a healthy mood , his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends first , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication led by social media , with its emphasis on style and substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call exc@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that works much deeper on our spiritual health .
and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared money can really not buy money .
the beauty at Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
every character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which shines through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football gu@@ cks in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely get involved , even though they often hold back to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of telep@@ hon@@ y care told me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and su@@ ici@@ dal is really shown to me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ si@@ ders status on the phone may also help people in moments of despair , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ fest this weekend with the backdrop to the celebration of the day completely re@@ designed cou@@ lis@@ se , why don &apos;t you take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to crush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö at the Prin@@ zen@@ park sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French champion on the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally got their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head@@ ball@@ tor in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Kor@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk in the group A , Paris also needs a strong start against the Swedish champion as it does not only aim for the kno@@ ck@@ out for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League , so it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause problems and look back relaxed even if there are certain things we need to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t scored one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , which at the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 Draw in his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed by Paul Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ inian wing storm was called the man who was taken to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month , and he indicated why , when he entered Marco Ver@@ rat@@ i &apos;s pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense , he ended up nicely in the long corner of the grid .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , played at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was faced with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy opponent .
but apart from a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps and posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G sometimes gave himself up , with some mis@@ ses and bad connections , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was p@@ ung@@ ed in the first half by no less than five attempts , after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ starting .
nevertheless he showed much more skill when he brought his fellow players to the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who turned Di Maria into a shooting , which was hang@@ ed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the H@@ ours of H@@ ours thanks to Cav@@ ani . thus , the Urugu@@ ay@@ an scored his sixth place after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from a very short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the end result could be kept low before the replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi detected a gate at the end .
the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we have only played in the Swedish League , which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualifying games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Glen@@ core collects $ 2.5 billion through share sales
the Swiss @-@ based mining giant Glen@@ core , which is affected by the collapse of raw material prices , collected $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday as part of its huge debt plan plan .
the London registered company Glen@@ core stated in an explanation that it sold new shares worth about 1.6 billion pounds to pay off its own debts .
the company , which lost 57 per cent of its market value this year , struggles with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn push@@ es demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
in the early Wednesday morning , the subscription rights issue brought a rapid rise to the top of the London Stock Exchange .
the share jumped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Glen@@ core had announced last week $ 2.5 billion in stock sales as part of the more extensive plans to cut around a third of its $ 30 billion debt .
the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the group .
concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other raw material prices have declined by 20 to 40 percent .

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i plays for al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously just before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who at that time played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times winner league , four times champion league winner , two times club world champion , twice world champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in summer the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to Qatar as al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club .
but in an interview with Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now betra@@ ys that he already stood before the European Championships in 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything at that time , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ bl@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; reminder : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FC Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i didn &apos;t change
but the change did not come about .
and the crucial man for this is now working for the German record champion : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has put Gu@@ ardi@@ ola under contract and I played a great EM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s how he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s playing time was running with X@@ av@@ i 2008 / 2009 .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter final of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the entire distance on the lawn , out@@ dated the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s triumph at the end .
Matt Dam@@ on plays down variety in film creation
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a episode of the Sunday night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , when she stressed the need for alternative perspectives , emphas@@ ised the need for a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in filling the film and not in filling the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted dis@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comment@@ aries of the actor of The Mar@@ tian were captiv@@ ating . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers of producers Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown first said .
the only black person , and she is a ut@@ te beaten by her white tie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the producer of Dear White People set himself for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that their direction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could give us something that we don &apos;t want &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO WH@@ ITE that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 returns and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact rac@@ ist representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement achieved national impact and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discri@@ min@@ atory practices against color retention .
in February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album quiet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement published an explanation as a response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le invited to visit the Pope in order to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos; crowned the first champion
professional sports climbing and operator assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday evening and took the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just finished their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could finish all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the final .
for the last task , climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope was in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten completed the task within the time he was the first athlete to complete the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge in three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock over winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never deserved more than 10,000 $ or had life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of a sudden ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first ended the course at all , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it receives the great gra@@ ci@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he has any res@@ ent@@ ment over it .
he has just been so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt just as if they had exchanged the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or was extended for an eighth season , the filming will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aks along Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once upon a time , they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers were reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the Target Field .
the T@@ wins gave a chance to climb within one half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to write about a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all wins make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad E@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw at the bull@@ pen every game , and so I want to go into the game quite concentrated .
the designed Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits vs the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the sleep @-@ wood well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aus@@ mus said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( punch training ) , looked clearly better out of the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three rings at the end of the seventh inner ring , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play again .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy &apos;s lef@@ th@@ anded Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy passed the Wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run escape to the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the finale run at the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time this season in the Major League that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe made a double play
when Detroit added a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth indoor ring , wall made a R@@ BI double against the c@@ un@@ ning of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the status of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed , however , dropped S@@ ano in three Pit@@ ches for his fifth save .
Detroit benefited from the start of the game by an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two Inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been painted before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he had been missing more than one month because of a back pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt better when I released and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ushes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , which made a single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up the middle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z scored his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing Position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second , a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single by Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mo@@ li@@ tor .
he didn &apos;t beat very well , but he caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns in six hits and a walk with four strokes .
note : tiger R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z was eliminated because of a violation of the throwing training .
he is being investigated by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list due to a shoulder strain , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z out of the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris stri@@ ves from the vulner@@ ability list to launch against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since it was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing on the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are expected to come in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the most anger@@ ed people will then be housed in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city Wiesbaden shared on Tuesday evening .
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hessen State Capital have been prepared for this event in recent days .
up to 1,000 refugees can go down there temporarily .
they will then be distributed to other communities .
in the past ten days alone , according to the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Gie@@ ßen County , 7@@ 500 people in Hessen had arrived in Hessen .
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that resol@@ ute thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective way@@ points &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago we were glad that the Kel@@ ch had passed a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive expansion of international aid on the ground for refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
in Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister of the Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , announced on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , but no one will be sent back to Hungary .
Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it &apos;s so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement in which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the General Director of Public Safety and representatives of Germany .
she did not call her concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their aim is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of further 120 000 refugees at a special meeting on Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the strong refugee sent in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries more strongly in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined those people who need protection , they also complain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a lead perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this view has been em@@ ph@@ atically divided in the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Chancellor emphas@@ ised that the state as a whole must now face a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometer long border with Serbia during the night of Tuesday .
a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest to disman@@ tle the border with Romania with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from spreading over Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had aver@@ ted the fence .

space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the icy p@@ anz@@ er of Saturn &apos;s moon , En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us sp@@ lashes out a global ocean .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is concluded by researchers from observations of the space probe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore the moon stag@@ gers slightly on its path around the ring planet .
this tum@@ ble motion is only small , but nevertheless too large for a permanently strong cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) of Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technical sheet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a long time it was known that there must be liquid water under the iron blanket of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the South Pole of Saturn &apos;s moon in 2006 , sp@@ it the steam and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the south pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then .
however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not clear .
R@@ ama is missing in 1860 Munich several weeks
the 1860 Munich has to give up around one month on offensive player Val@@ det R@@ ama .
the association with the 27 @-@ year @-@ old gave an investigation into an investigation .
R@@ ama compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich Lion , the diagnosis means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expected four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of an un@@ compromising professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a training guest , the six@@ ties initially presented a defensive man .
the 30 year old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at currently has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the possibility of proving his ability to prove . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

contrary to the first fears , however , he remained without a serious bl@@ ess@@ orship .
no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain lots of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line will often get away from them .
because man@@ goes contain relatively large amounts of sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
healthy are the exotic fruits nevertheless : in them are B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ur@@ sor beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits are therefore supported by vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone does not tell about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and are consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go , however , also gives a special touch to sav@@ our@@ y dishes .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some Bl@@ at@@ ts@@ al@@ ate like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney goes well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .

first fo@@ eh@@ ouse , then striking cold front
the night falls in the valleys of the Alpine side of the F@@ öhn through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland shared on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and on the night on Thursday the F@@ öhn blows partly with stor@@ my strength through the fet@@ al valleys .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a marked cold front which brings strong ra@@ ins , wind gu@@ sts and a drop in temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area above the British Is@@ les in a strong southwest current .
on the mountain@@ side , the F@@ öhn breaks through the valleys during the night .
as a result , the F@@ öhn blows up to Thursday morning in the fet@@ al valleys with bends of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with more than 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn can advance in places to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and even hurri@@ can@@ es of over 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair @-@ dryer provides for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow at the mountain@@ side slope .
this is where rain stops , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , over 100 litres of rain per square meter in the south of the Alps must be reck@@ oned with more than 100 litres of rain per square meter , this after a large amount of rain has already fallen in recent days .
on Thursday morning the F@@ öhn blows the air , in the episode a cold front rolls with a strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east through Switzerland .
along with the cold front the wind re@@ fres@@ hes strongly to stor@@ my , and the temperatures rise significantly .
the following days present in the north autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , on the weekend sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Place
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ place in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino a so far nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ formers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is right in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working community of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could often only live in hiding in their faith .
in a symbolic way , the square will be seen in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) stayed in Rome as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 .
he felt the city at that time a ver@@ itable sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
his negative impressions could have strengthened him according to historians in his later fight against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the division of the Oc@@ ci@@ dent Church with his theses against the aband@@ on@@ ment of the Oc@@ ci@@ dent Church .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) thorn crown is one of the major works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with gorgeous pictures .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has been given to the 75 year old - but what is not at all the same with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , it can be quite glo@@ omy .
for three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he met a subjective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books .
these are cycles that dev@@ ote themselves to themes such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , commandments or pat@@ ernity .
the same applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books .
and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the biblical passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible sites selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into current context into today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts &apos;s painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible study of Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
this allows the 75 @-@ year @-@ old to gain a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately triggered for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing has already been done with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up , perhaps to carry me back with the Lord &apos;s father again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to bring art to more value in a fast @-@ pac@@ ed time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is shaped by advertising today , and that is loud .
symbo@@ lis@@ m is being displaced .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewers to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hin@@ der &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the images , let them appear , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture seeks its counterpart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he compreh@@ ends life with his paintings . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not care to fully grasp the Bible , but chosen the most important , also mysterious subjects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts images speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on November 15 in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn is approaching
plans made , place found , company commissioned , earth moun@@ ds mod@@ elled for a circuit : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X , it was already finished .
failures in politics and administration ensured dr@@ astic , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
so hill de@@ ported , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the permission will be made in October , and the first coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further pause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensified engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees by 2019 , and the Bundes@@ liga is a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football responds to the worsen@@ ing situation in Germany and sec@@ ures policy its help in tac@@ kling the upcoming problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle , that &apos;s nothing about me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to every individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B chief Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he plans to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the chan@@ cell@@ or next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State , Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and want to help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must be policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football League has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Nier@@ s@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A session in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already this weekend , the 36 professionals will sign a clear sign when they are on the left tri@@ cot , instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s manager Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes everyone , nobody can see away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football allies , no , we must use our bla@@ sting power , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the League &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the Euro qualification game against Hungary on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ren@@ al s@@ bach called the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 licenses have started their own projects in their places , be great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this year and next year , the association together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government provides 300 000 euros each for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have also called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP CEO loses an eye in accidents
the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost sight of the left eye due to a fall in early July .
during the accident on the staircase in the house of his brother in the USA , he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s almost ble@@ ed , was power@@ less , then pulled out on the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP Co @-@ Fo@@ under Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can follow his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he will come back to Germany in October and continue the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full of my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , I stood in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer at the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up once you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

constitutional Complaints ( BvR ) ( Number of result : 1 )
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback from Marco R@@ eus in the first group game of the Europa League will defini@@ tively be broken .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the soccer league in Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19 : 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot resort to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high burden of its professionals , Tu@@ chel will not only change its master &apos;s position on the R@@ eus position .
so he announced a change on the goal guard position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of parent company Roman bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the world champion .
however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in the future in all European league games , Tu@@ chel has left open .
with a high probability he will also play the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ sche statement by fellow players R@@ eus that the final entry for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , mid @-@ field player Julian Wei@@ gl considers it understandable : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is why Marco is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants to play a pioneering role for Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the change of cars .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse IA@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who come together with representatives from industry at the IA@@ A .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid increase in digital radio communications .
there is currently a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria to test new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; avoid any additional liability risks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government intends to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legal framework and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to employ roughly international that the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is lifted from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only envis@@ aged the human being as a driver .
in automated driving , the car is increasingly taking the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways is technically possible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are expected to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wait far after 2020 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authors of the study estimate the value @-@ added value in the driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location of Germany for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the issue of liability in accidents and the safety of the drivers &apos; personal data must be clearly defined .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still see scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the investig@@ ator Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect this at all in 20 years .
in France , 21 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed are counting up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , 33 percent in the United States .
drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the Bit@@ kom digital network , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire ride on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could still be 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
well every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .

according to the current status of the title fight from September 25 to October 4 , Düsseldorf , Düsseldorf wants to open only in singles .
the final decision is to drop by September 22 at the latest .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this point , Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ing date in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to reti@@ re on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo the disadvantage , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said individual European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ bat@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ list in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , Timo also lack@@ ed , and we became European champi@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should be guided by this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the world ranking fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins that look terri@@ fying thanks to video projections .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ak , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from the 18th of September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been done in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about as much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Die@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the scarcely @-@ looking work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which much effort has been carried out : to fro@@ ze the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired for example .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have made 14 tons of material .
just before the start of the October festival there was still a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a leather pants outfit with a cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he was always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , timi@@ d fashion attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught the design of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , such as Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought them , but of course .
for his first own fashion show he couldn &apos;t pay the models .
they got nothing but could keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener tip as fashion niche
earlier we went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and sp@@ ikes were created in a large amount for customers who , for example , re@@ worked for blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work today anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the P@@ lau@@ en family .
instead , fashion is important again .
fashion plays a major role in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener tip , and has then been displaced by the home textiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls a few examples : lace in jewelry , for accessories like bags and for regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which is borrow@@ ed from past bull po@@ ets , is an increasing order potential .
those who have no niche in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already have half of all orders .
P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze und Sti@@ cker@@ eien together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the last 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken off .
there are almost no more private stores and wholesale dealers .
our products hardly reach customers in this way .
nowadays the mass @-@ goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively sold through chains .
in addition , exports are weaker , up @-@ to @-@ date in Russia and the USA .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score points with environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stick@@ per@@ le &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we have a quality seal that demonstrates that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch of the Z@@ wick@@ au University of Saxony - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - special@@ ising in embroi@@ der@@ ies and sp@@ ikes .
to counter@@ pose the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the companies that need to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly different to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ marked the historical snow@@ ball tip .
at the same time , the machine sticks small spheres in some places .
the P@@ lau@@ ener gol@@ ds@@ mith master of Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired by this : &quot; I couldn &apos;t do anything before with the traditional P@@ lau@@ ener tip . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewellery .
in an elaborate process , she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the subject of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reu@@ ter says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who would like to have a mem@@ ento .
with this I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
legends are not supposed to be touched , but Disney still vent@@ ures to a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not about a re @-@ movie but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes 20 years after the first movie with the magic kid @-@ girl .
it is about the experiences of N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director says : Ro@@ b Marshall , last but not least , &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI postpon@@ es to open the economy more broad@@ ly to the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy must open wide to the outside to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday a group charged with steering the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and know @-@ how and improving the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; encouraging new start @-@ ups and promoting reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list regulating the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the inhabitants milking system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance as it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , guaranteeing a legal state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art business environment and designed the market more open , the statement said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen controls over the powers transferred to the company and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business .
the statement also said that China border regions will allow new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state controlled sectors , additional areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded businesses and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to guarantee the right of the lawyers to exercise their work , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated in the meeting as reported in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double the mercury limit value in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and to make consumers a significantly higher dose of nerve toxins . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who is present in the EU , critic@@ ised the plans sharply : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force to pregnant women and infants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t at F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish should be raised at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish for &quot; economic reasons , &quot; from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
big predat@@ ory fish are already so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury , that at the basis of the existing limit values , about 50 percent of catches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be irre@@ vo@@ cable .
in return for this e@@ asing , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values of other fish from 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch said this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller gra@@ vey@@ ards , such as car@@ p are usually so low , that they are already adher@@ ing to the planned maximum levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dy distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , which is strongly enriched by the food chain especially in predat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small quantities can cause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage in view of the maximum levels in force but that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly caused by coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power plants meet more than six metric tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount emit@@ ted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceeded permanently and nationwide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had quoted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish have already been among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU @-@ warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
