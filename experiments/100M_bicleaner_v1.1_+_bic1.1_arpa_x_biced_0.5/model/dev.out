Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Teher@@ an &apos;s destabili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the controversial two @-@ state solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for many years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal struck by Obama on the Iranian nuclear programme has worsen@@ ed the relationship between the two .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the US Congress , which was partly considered as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had refused this with reference to the election in Israel at that time .
in an emergency call Professor , to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; lamb was important to stress that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house , the officials found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note showing off a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I could undo it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who loved me ever . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who was in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already left 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular professor of history , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office according to the police .
Delta State University Police Chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb made a fatal emergency call after that .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cled him .
a day after the shooting at the university , forcing students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were happy with his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both were taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty included 17 members , and many students attended courses from both .
at the same time , there were some inclin@@ ations to problematic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he only taught two online courses .
the latest changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard for him , would not constitute a guarantee for an automatic approach to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
after the escape from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs later , when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before being arrested , Lamb confi@@ ded himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson said .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
lamb started his work at the university in 2009 which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and has taught geography and pedago@@ gy .
he did his doc@@ torate in early spring in pedago@@ gy .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met together by common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool old guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar game .
at that time , he was the s@@ warm of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls melted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the cry of distress , Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no document of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played Blues .
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail performed both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September for the last time , after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica play before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that anything was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were in the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American native people and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his bro@@ therhood and student committee .
around 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and on Tuesday evening , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight commem@@ oration ceremony .
Schmid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the vi@@ gi@@ l while the University Choir &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press Auth@@ ors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb had shot the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his cry called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .

Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was professionally a big moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it seems to me that I am a simul@@ ated y@@ aw@@ ning and a length of length from being with Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had its premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s real for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time travel film ever made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says that his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict and more weapons will only ag@@ grav@@ ate violence and misery for millions of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UN chief once again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution .
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the si@@ delines of the General Assembly of the General Assembly to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tac@@ kling the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 Survey results showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks among poll@@ s down , it has ( still ) not working .
ten of the last eleven national surveys show Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ in@@ ating real estate Mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the asc@@ ending Her@@ man Cain , none of which won only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bus@@ hes Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise tr@@ umps per@@ sever@@ ance and begin to drop their dollars to overthrow him .
here are some current survey data suggest@@ ing that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jumps &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have turned 180 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two out of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l Posi@@ tive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , 52 percent were .
now six out of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P voters were happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C pol@@ l last week , 67 percent of Republi@@ cans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of ten say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent saying the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abli@@ shment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Republi@@ cans don &apos;t see b@@ umps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number applies in the nation &apos;s first presidential state , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a supreme commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his ministry , and nearly six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament is not fit into the White House , thus ABC / Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; republi@@ can voters get used to the idea . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they expose their funds , republi@@ can voters think that it is real . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if they are asked who best wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten say that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time four of ten of July put their money at J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : in the past GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry was winning the nom@@ ination only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
yet it is evident that a large number of GO@@ P voters look at the campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ cans were gathering for another candidate , Tr@@ ump is beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to trun@@ c@@ esses leadership , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is diff@@ used to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump has picked up the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a small majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have firmly awarded their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 per cent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
however , tr@@ umps is the strongest competitor at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they coinci@@ de with the issue of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign two months ago , immigrants from Mexico called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the immigration and pi@@ vot@@ al point in the public discourse was about 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump will keep critical His@@ pan@@ o Americans away from the Republi@@ can Party and damage new orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration issues .
so long as immigration remains in the spotlight , it seems to be Donald Tr@@ ump too .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs on new high@@ ways .
meanwhile , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son accounts for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , mainly due to their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Monday @-@ survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three out of four I@@ owa Republi@@ cans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , 54 percent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent are in@@ fern@@ ally anger@@ ed . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : Germany &apos;s five most exclusive residential areas
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg you find the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea .
in the street a square meter of a Re@@ et@@ dach@@ haus costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the supply of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special locations one square meter is most cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential resorts , however , one price is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the Real Estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ er has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square footage in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros not - per square meter , well noticed .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the forefront here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria &apos;s dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
double Tor@@ cher in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has a run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way to FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympic Games Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it went .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e put a dream start to FC Bayern in the wit@@ ches &quot; essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus in the &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the team of coaches P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their performance in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Götz@@ e hits ( 8@@ 9th ) deserves with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth starting success in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller won with his 28th hits in the Champions League for the Bavarian lead ben@@ evol@@ ent assistance from Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who let a f@@ lange of the World Champion pass through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans in front of the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 - and the Munich held word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated imagination without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his most recent six home matches in the top class , including famous clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) was also proud of this in 2011 .
but Bavaria , in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams un@@ defeated , did not want to be the next victim .
they ran bol@@ dly , but in their offen@@ sive efforts it was often too in@@ ventive to work .
the attacks were often initiated by a shifting of links on the left @-@ hand side of Douglas Costa , which was rarely seen by former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right when his flan@@ k came from the right half @-@ field in the left upper tor@@ rent .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , as Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer ide@@ ye Brown struck the head ball of the Pole ( 26 . ) .
then by direct debit , the keeper Roberto par@@ ted with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians had their usual dominant play , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could put needle @-@ pins .
but on go@@ al@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er was reli@@ ance .
for example , when he ste@@ ered a shot of Ide@@ a over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
recently , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola brought a four @-@ chain together with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it good .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems in the Ka@@ der , sat outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero has only given the green light after finishing his final training , said Lei@@ feld Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to do something else from it is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the ailing Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made clear 13 minutes later everything clear , mil@@ ler put mil@@ ler on it .
before the game , it had come to Kra@@ j@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly mas@@ ked Bayern fans in their spect@@ ator block obviously prov@@ oked the supporters of hosts Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces interven@@ ed and attacked the Munich @-@ based supporters .
at least one Bayern fan was injured out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
those who smoke will not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
good news : with ren@@ unci@@ ation the risk drops quickly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth early in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold .
the scientists had observed over 23,@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the gum , the DI@@ f@@ E emphasizes .
smoking is a risk factor for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , the authors emphas@@ ise .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore reduced to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
people who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short period of time , write the researchers in the Journal of Dental Research .
however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment returns to the level of non @-@ smokers , the author Thomas Dietrich explained from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smokers , said director H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for lungs and j@@ ars and , according to our findings , leads to good dental health until age .
in Germany more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of denti@@ sts , the DI@@ f@@ E shared .
previous studies have indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study confirms the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists stum@@ ble on lef@@ to@@ vers from the late Anti@@ quity in Cologne &apos;s Rhine bank
archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the time being .
in the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard , arch@@ e@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and rem@@ nants of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
historians have been searching for so @-@ called ground monuments since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine .
for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as the Department of Arch@@ ae@@ ological Natural Heritage .
in the third stage of the Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard the archae@@ ologists were now found .
it was already known from text documents that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century had stood a church , explained Trier .
in addition to rem@@ nants of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with around 350 tom@@ bs was discovered , which probably belonged to the church .

EU Commission propos@@ ing a new court in dispute over TTIP
the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system for the resolution of the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration equipment for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system which , in its function , corresponds to significantly more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens can trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner @-@ design@@ ate Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ ström in the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de intends to include the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced its support .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through TTIP , the largest free trade area in the world is set to rise to 800 million people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings take place in concrete terms that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to come to equal parts from the EU , the US and from third countries .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow obj@@ ections to be made against Jud@@ g@@ ments .
until now , the parties involved themselves on arbit@@ rators , and there was no objection to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the debate over the past few months , it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , she wants to work towards an international investment court .
there could then also be clari@@ fied disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) required above all by large corporations are regarded as one of the main reasons for the great opposition in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are critic@@ ised by ad@@ versaries as a kind of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary , which companies can under@@ ride damage to the tax@@ pa@@ yers , lev@@ y national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act considered the EU Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate .
it was critic@@ ised above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
on the other hand , the German state secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , described the plans as big progress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission took into account essential points in the reform that the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU foreign ministers in the spring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the possibilities of the economy by too many new rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially small and medium @-@ sized businesses could be dis@@ advant@@ aged by this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the negotiations on the TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) TTIP ( TTIP ) remained unclear on Wednesday .
negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
so far , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be un@@ sustainable .
delicate folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a flip chart , on which the shy working folk singer recorded the picturesque US state of Mich@@ igan with felt @-@ tip pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost gra@@ bbed by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he talks about different places he always records on the map , about his meti@@ cul@@ ously arranged songs .
where they originated and how it looks like in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be a wonderfully creative person .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs seem to be harmonious very close to American folk of the late Six@@ ties , but can always drift into great opul@@ ent .
the rum@@ or arises that &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 states of the United States should be followed .
but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has a positive anticip@@ ation .
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
guitar and ban@@ jo meet him live .
a year later , the musician living in New York returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , a sophisticated master@@ work appears in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exu@@ ding ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the US Bill@@ board charts and lacks any yearly list of influential music media .
after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens is then served on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic fragments .
this sixth studio album is still orchest@@ rated , yet supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ b .
since long since the smaller club has desc@@ ended , the stage shows here become a colourful spectacle made of ne@@ on brow@@ band and large @-@ lumin@@ escent stage de@@ ko .
currently , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring as part of a five member band through Germany .
in the dark@@ ened ham@@ burger More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although almost 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the clearly arranged St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk .
without directing a word to the audience , the band plays excell@@ ently through the broad @-@ enriched album .
from the audience one hears : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and one can therefore throw away the &quot; record in essence . &quot;
only after an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens mo@@ dest@@ eps humble , plays acousti@@ cally a few older songs and eventually turns into thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s findings
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns will debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ aire with suspen@@ se
the new Labour leader , Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , will make his debut at the prime minister &apos;s question@@ aire and for the first time he will be hosting David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to address the first of his six pre @-@ set questions shortly after mid@@ day , and his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MPs from around the world .
he called for &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip a few meetings to leave colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several titles @-@ stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told in the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve the leadership of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , and they con@@ v@@ ene on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party supported him as a leader .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; stack@@ ed &quot; within Labour , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of winning .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes take place to remove the whole idea of a limit in all .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow labour and pension minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he is T@@ ory Boss , across the Dis@@ patch box across the Parliament over the past decade .
the Labour leader who promised another policy set says he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s question is too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he is subjected to both &quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ality &quot; and stri@@ fe with re@@ tain@@ ers , and instead has undertaken to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economic minister will represent him if he doesn &apos;t take part - for example if Mr Cameron is on the road abroad .
he also gave the idea that other colleagues occasionally speak the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , speaker of the Lower House , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kasper@@ l theatre &quot; that is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s questions . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast in 1990 on television , the question was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Parliament and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound increases due to accelerated wage growth in the UK
the pound increased le@@ aps @-@ like to data showing an increase in the UK &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , FT@@ SE 100 was enhanced by SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s bid objective .
between May and July , earnings without Bon@@ uses in the United Kingdom increased by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and achieved appreciation for the time of an increase in interest rates since 2009 .
the pound increased by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed by 0.@@ 84 % over the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 index topped with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after tak@@ eover offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v received .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - again reported growth .
Glen@@ core stocks rose 5 % after the mining giant said that it took $ 2.5 billion by stock sales as part of its strategy of reducing debt .
the shares of the Packaging and Paper Group Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his assessment for the company R@@ ating on &quot; Sale . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sports lending business reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the head of J@@ D Sports says higher wages would je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se expansion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Managing Director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Lebanese to potato d@@ ön@@ er idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
both - and indeed in the potato d@@ ön@@ er , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger im@@ pregn@@ ation owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
inspired by the word &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay Pot@@ ato and meat together on a sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he accidentally saw on TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then there is a barbecue sk@@ ewer in his shop , which is sto@@ cked with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is multi@@ cultural for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea has meanwhile been registered by the Lebanese by the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
therefore , Al@@ hay does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also applies to its customers .
met@@ a La@@ un@@ ches Re@@ action Campa@@ ign to Com@@ bat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ cre@@ ases
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a sustainability campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand I@@ GA through mainstream marketing and marketing across social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and retail owners who sell dis@@ counted tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish more details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler of food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor strategy day .
there is much in the game as South Australia and Western Australia make up nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia in comparison to around 14 percent in Eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will s@@ nat@@ ch around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of its first markets and will take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retail@@ er could lose $ 360 million revenue per year and $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed @-@ cost base could cost around 13 million dollars of profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found out that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in food and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told Melbourne that Met@@ cash would likely disappear within a decade .
it declined to publicly respond to the comment by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a member of the board of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
i@@ GA@@ S market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retail@@ er , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the reduction in operating debt on revenues and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million in order to equ@@ alize selling prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by increasing rapidly growing fresh foods and providing a better selection of private label food .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Chief Executive Officer Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging programs to El@@ an are expected to grow and hope that in 2017 the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of Australian tennis player Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Hor@@ gi@@ os and , according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly , deserved praise as a cri@@ tique of his own conduct .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s &quot; became ramp@@ ant through the not@@ orious discussion of Kyr@@ gy@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , after that , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated by the refer@@ ee twice , saying : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have beat Kyr@@ gy@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp fired a potential US @-@ open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth at the second place behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I am rather busy about is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was a bit dra@@ gged into the conflict , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a bat as he lost due to a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so forth , and I think he deserves a lot of appreciation .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I think he was treated a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he &apos;s good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Kyr@@ gy@@ z on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for everybody , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed part to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ os &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Nick has quickly made the climb what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray made . he has made some bad mistakes and he deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the li@@ mel@@ ight , in which he can only think about it , I consider appropriate and it is best for the team and it is the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency situation , closes the border , stops refugees
Hungary declared the emergency and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to go illeg@@ ally into the country .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of migrants were accum@@ ulating in a no @-@ man land and re@@ acted Ser@@ b officials with rebellion .
the people fle@@ eing from violence had stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled down there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants cann@@ oned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sm@@ iled insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police force . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of them rejected food and water from protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; talks will have to take place in Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Ser@@ b border came one day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a con@@ ten@@ tious meeting in Brussels that no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the over@@ inking Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement was reached that the EU would include more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for a special summit in the European Union to discuss the continent &apos;s migration crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a soon action from Brussels or its neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency situation in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities greater powers to cope with the crisis so they could unlock streets and speed asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to stated that his country plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after having ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were deployed during the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and at the point of entry into the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most incoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU countries , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or damaging the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) high fence that the government had built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also impose higher sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the emergency situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porter in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the use of the military , which will be expected next week , but Associ@@ ated Press re@@ porters have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on a daily basis .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities had caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of commit@@ ting crimes under new laws .
authorities are busy re@@ pairing the fence .
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning , after a train wag@@ gon arrived with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd to penetrate themselves there .
about 20 people were able to get in , but thousands were outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l hal@@ ved
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton is still holding a double @-@ digit advance in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins over against her .
Clinton now has the support of 47 per cent of the democratic voters in the primary elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he can@@ dic@@ ates for the presi@@ dency , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the start of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion determines what candidates they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news pol@@ l , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders earned a few gains .
Clinton has a leading edge among women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have decreased .
their support for the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under the age of 50 has rap@@ ed , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , however , has a major step ahead with the older voters .
last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ ander with a double @-@ digit margin for the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries say nationwide that they would support Clinton if it were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some reservations and further 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her .
the views are more bl@@ ended with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about one quarter would inspire them enthusi@@ astically .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman president becomes ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
from Clinton &apos;s supporters , their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) is also mentioned .
approval to deal with the problems and the legi@@ bility are also quoted .
since the Vice President casts a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 per cent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries want to see him in the race - even though a third believes that he should not do it .
if democratic elec@@ tors of the primary elections are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
from Clinton &apos;s followers , more than half say that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to make a candidate for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of S@@ anders increases from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure declined from 78 percent last month .
Bi@@ den is by far the second in this measurement , but the percentage that regards it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , in the question of what is more important with a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similarly as in the last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elec@@ tors will stand out as unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates are providing good results with some important features in voters of their party &apos;s primary elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maj@@ orities Main@@ tain Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
among the three candidates , Bi@@ den cuts with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinion of it .
democratic voters of the prim@@ aries generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ideological in line with their views .
for all of these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters do not have any opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions asked about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server during the term of office as foreign minister , most Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions .
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the email controversy had no impact on their general opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said their opinion had deterior@@ ated .
it is mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six out of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse .
although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters overall : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not consider them to be an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of eligible voters will also see Tr@@ ump as not honest and trust@@ worthy .
however , Clinton and Tr@@ ump get good grades in leadership .
of the six trials tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders as honest , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the error ratio for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the primary elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son approaches Donald Tr@@ ump in a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son finds himself close to Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest news from C@@ BS News / New York Times
in the meantime , half of the voters &quot; support in the new pol@@ l is eliminated , and others lose dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers . support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted prior to Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the Tuesday survey .
but Car@@ son enjoyed the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump among republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is kno@@ cked down with Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell at the lowest , from 10 % support in the last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor of Florida , J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place with 6 % .
the error margin at the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey released last week shows that Car@@ son is in the opinion poll@@ s - with 19 % support from the Republi@@ cans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey conducted by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump well ahead of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising in the past week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for former neuro@@ sur@@ geons , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed for questioning her faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing tourists to find even warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people don &apos;t go to the sea anymore : the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees in this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) informs .
at sea temperatures , however , the Mediterranean continues to offer : in the east it can even reach up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic Sea it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood contaminated with the death of Bar@@ uch College new@@ ings
almost two years after a student died during a religious ritual of a student association in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , mur@@ ders were filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally during an introduction ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which resulted in his death , divided the police .
officials said he had been bur@@ dened with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a goal over a frozen field .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about headaches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call on the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g fain@@ ted and allegedly waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ fy his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said Poli@@ gra@@ f Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide items and set the bro@@ therhood of the Brotherhood in principle about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ gra@@ f Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning in his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g was repeatedly added with a bl@@ unt force injury to head , trunk and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student has died in the ch@@ ic@@ anes every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing the D@@ eng@@ es family in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe advised an indictment for the murder of the third counts for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with criminal attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that has - officially or in@@ officially - sanc@@ tioned this , we will also be held accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College prohibited the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a raise of interest comes , and the domestic se is falling down , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long this will last and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only a small guide to the process .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and financial systems react .
hence , representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so sharply that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period needed for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that the whole fuss might be exagger@@ ated due to a net interest rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no re@@ perc@@ ussions .
here is a look at historic trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , interest increases can make things more volatile for a while .
as soon as the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that wealthy income will be paid 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which might reflect the delay in monetary policy again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after interest rates in the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market is usually upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days after ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then return to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a current analysis published by Bob D@@ oll , Head of plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares ten@@ se tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return on return is beginning to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often encourage them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not exist before and could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the nominal GDP had only twice the nominal GDP by 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rates in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If this time is different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Deutsche Bank said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants agreed to increase the interest rate of the F@@ ed all year , and all eyes were set at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trading forecasts a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all the increase cycles of 1950 to date have taken place in a super @-@ cycle with increasing GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ism very quickly put in shadow after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
the fixed income was also volatile as the market anticip@@ ates the increase in interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than when stocks change their strategic course .
in bonds the returns appear to change direction once the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the increase cycle , the bond yields immediately fall , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will result in yields between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a de@@ fl@@ ation of the curve .
high interest bonds often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher returns , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , a fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
it is interesting , says Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is flat , credit tigh@@ tening has expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all features of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy .
in large and large , companies that handle the larger part of their business operations in the United States will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt will get worse , as an increasing dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market , and also the financing of their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to respond exceedingly positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet sur@@ passed an average of 5 percentage points after each of the Libor rate in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose the most , said Gold@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside of pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the increasing dollar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
savers could see gains from higher returns , even if experts of different opinions are how fast this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says EP Member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament &apos;s Conserv@@ ative member critici@@ zed the sender for his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly indi@@ st@@ ingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said they were just the Br@@ its im@@ itated
&quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins gra@@ bbed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , maintains a leading member of Parliament and raises new pressure on the station to prove that he does something that the private sen@@ ders do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; conserv@@ atives Euro MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evapor@@ ates &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is increasingly no longer distingu@@ ishable from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vap@@ ori@@ ze &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also focused on the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be The Br@@ its only under a different name .
so , if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples where you only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General dismissed the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and education .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn anything else about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to commission new works is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that he needed to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past , because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which came under fire during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sports to hit the feet of commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - was produced &quot; in a special way . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when the next time there was a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the orders of other series of The Voice in the future , or to issue money for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales rose in August the slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
in the last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed spending in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has bo@@ omed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
but experts say that there is now evidence that online sales stagn@@ ate , after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase over the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back until 2000 , this has always been developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index of the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he stated that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started working with their mobile purchases .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that is coming up and we may experience that the growth is dimin@@ ishing .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing revenues .
experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday of November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers came across their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites r@@ ushed off .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers were fighting for bar@@ gains , could stop buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 spending was spent slightly more than £ 1 online .
in some products , such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of wearing fashion labels in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca during the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funeral in Mec@@ ca through the streets .
Saudi Arabia places the collapse in parts of the huge Saudi Bin Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried across the streets to bury the victims killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s major mosque .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the track to pay their respect when the first of the dead occurred their last trip to the al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the procession went past the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane passed through the ceiling of the mosque and then upon the worshi@@ ppers .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for burial , when the Saudi King informed about the construction company of the Bin Laden &apos;s family because of the catastrophe , which left 3@@ 94 wounded , a san@@ ction .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 persons who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central mosque of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was the father of four children who had been on his first pilgrimage to support the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi officers have already firmly agreed that the H@@ add@@ sch will go on to Mec@@ ca with thousands of people who will continue to come to the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden group should not have stopped the arm of the crane when it was not used .
an Arab version of the decree released by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad was prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man was to reveal what caused the overthrow of the crane , pl@@ ung@@ ing into an inner courtyard of the Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which later takes place this month .
the Bin Laden Group did not release any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a comment .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also bl@@ amed the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because it did not co@@ operating with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s major mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive project managed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over large construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a apo@@ state son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the crane crash came amid heavy winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim .
officials said that 15@@ 8 people stay in the hospital .
government officials ordered that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4.000 ) to be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanently wounded .
other wounded receive half of this amount .

it is alleged that Brit@@ ons put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of skilled East European arti@@ sans who carry out work in their home .
if you can handle a hammer or a brush to painting walls , nowadays it seems to be a minority .
the British employ cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople to carry out DIY jobs in their homes , according to the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new managing director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the Bau@@ markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices is now obsol@@ ete .
therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that are aimed at craftsmen and close 60 outlets of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are met by women .
at the moment the men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to address the growing demographic trends that show more female single households that make more renovation than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a majority of men working in our stores . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this more towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our customers are made up of women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a UK in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in management positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that has exactly 50 % of the team occupied with women , including its management and financial officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and revenues , after the group had shoulder the cost of closing the shops .
because of the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the Landes@@ gericht K@@ lagen@@ furt on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian volleyball team A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for lack of fi@@ del@@ ity and distra@@ ction .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of office .
he has been legally convic@@ ted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
according to the State Prosecutor , Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary examination , the defend@@ ants had used funds for private purposes over the years 2006 to 2011 .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports officials are also accused of financial passing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact divided the chair@@ woman of the Sho@@ v@@ eller Senate , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
for the sake of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence presented that the association had not been a part of the property at any time .
the sports officials were only charged with expense damages and the sports club , for whom they had invested a lot of time and money from 1982 to 2011 , and which they invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities amounted to approximately 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 EUR ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time we stood before the situation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do we continue the club or lock us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the defend@@ ants , in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ read@@ mill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the finance office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleague and co @-@ defend@@ ant , he decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , our life insurance is saved as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during acceptance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , it is not allowed to make any debt .
furthermore , with the corresponding financial success the reimbur@@ sement of the expense damages had been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the expense allowance was paid only years later , namely , since 2003 , when a plus was on the account .
for this reason , flat @-@ rate and non @-@ detailed bookings also appeared , the former Ob@@ man explained the proceedings .
the accounts and pass@@ books governed the two defend@@ ants together , said the second defend@@ ant .
the judge asked why withdraw@@ als were not disclosed to the association in detail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association was not interested in the details of financial hard@@ ship , it was only the freedom of debt that was important , the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 , against the one functional investigation started because of abuse of office , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these were set@@ backs , the defend@@ ants declared .
this bank account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant and , according to his statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; why ? &quot; the judge wanted to know .
the respon@@ dent did not know the answer for a long time .
then he finally said he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the public prosec@@ utor put it in the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claim for damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why in@@ dem@@ n@@ ity ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said judge and prosec@@ utor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first defend@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this formulation because the association had never had any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the function@@ ary said he never covered a cent of his salary , he only calculated o@@ dom@@ eter money and diets .
he added 1,000 euros per month to the association , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added .
the accused had not been able to demonstrate exact documents for the early years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are after an audit , in which everything has been judged correctly , no longer kept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the second defend@@ ant also had dom@@ eter money .
he explained in his statement that all of the exercises had to be made in cash . in order to do so , he had to go to the Bank from his place of residence to the Bank in Blei@@ burg .
the trial continues on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard reaches another 30.000 jobs
in addition to staff reductions running for three years , the Compu@@ Ser@@ ese will aboli@@ sh additional jobs during the split@@ ting up of the company .
the U.S. computer giant H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) finds no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to disman@@ tle 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate client segment .
as a result , costs in the amount of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the step will lead to a special burden of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the exploitation of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years now .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP had employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates .
in exchange , the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share was 2.3 percent .
the company , which has grown up with printers from Pal@@ o Alto , is currently split up : this is how the computer and print business will be bund@@ led in a new company , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
both business units are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers according to its services , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer continued to rely on Lenovo recently .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
this was the result of the proceeds going back in 15 of 16 quarters .
HP responds with a split and massive footprint on the change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man recently re@@ acted to the fact that customers increasingly purchase smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and carry out more and more businesses online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans fores@@ ee a total of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflicts : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
a direct participation of German soldiers in hostili@@ ties in Iraq would , however , largely reject rejection : 54 per cent spoke against it , 35 per cent proved to be agre@@ able .
the fact that other states are flying air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive .
on the other hand , 24 percent are opposed to intervene in the conflict .
in cooperation with the Syrian government , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 per cent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed reject , 20 percent would be .
29 per cent couldn &apos;t decide .
car : second press day at 6@@ 6th IA@@ A
the exhibition focuses on connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars as well as electro@@ mobility by September 27 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mobility connects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the general public can visit the IA@@ A from Saturday .
two years ago , the organisers of the V@@ DA &quot; Auto @-@ Verband &quot; expect some 900@@ ,000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence erup@@ tion on Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used several hundred refugees on the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water@@ th@@ row@@ er .
Euron@@ ews @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the break @-@ out at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police , a police line had formed and a water @-@ light was standing behind the polic@@ emen .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially set up pepper spray .
after that , the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
the group was thus dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have withdrawn from now somewhat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the press spokes@@ persons of the Serbian police were also injured by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US bank
the world ob@@ serves , when the US bank@@ note comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade , interest has been raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of the view was that the F@@ ed will continue to do so , now think that the F@@ ed will remain slightly longer and hold interest rates at the current rate of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historic event because it is seven years since F@@ ed paid interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Chief Executive Officer at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global relationships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds are good against such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision is to be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
victim of Death at the Delta State University
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleagues on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note saying that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted to &quot; make it impossible , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of Ge@@ ography and Social Science Education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said he fired on someone and killed anyone .
lamb told the staff of the emergency call centre that the police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but he will probably be upset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he didn &apos;t give him .
lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 saying , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to undo it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman ever in love with me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police cir@@ cled him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; triangle relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that they were married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who was nin@@ et@@ een , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was their daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was working online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb told relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen captured him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in the spring of 2015 , Lamb received a PhD degree from the Delta State University , as his life lau can be found on the University &apos;s website .
stars who lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 , he fought against leu@@ ka@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .
the actor supposedly has to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession .
all this certainly demands its toll .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros per year alone with a better organisation .
150 of the 1,000 executives around the world will be able to reduce the workplace costs for Group restructuring .
meanwhile , with the pilot union , there are new negotiations .
the Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the cheaper Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the aim of the re@@ orientation is a contribution to earnings of around € 500 million per year in cost and selling syner@@ gies , announced the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , there is no longer a board of directors for the passenger business in the future .
the low @-@ cost airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the management team led by chief Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr .
with the new setup , Spo@@ hr under@@ scores the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employee has been complex .
the airlines operate under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
the negotiations after the scheduled strike on this Thursday will be resum@@ ed in the tari@@ ff conflict with the pilot adjustment cockpit ( VC ) .
that was what the union divided .
the topic of talks should be the retirement regime for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit wants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to produce results as soon as possible with a projected record result &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and the airline resulted in various strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savings concept in addition to the transition supply of the drivers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is apparent that the Lufthansa in the fight against competitor routes is reloc@@ ating to the Group &apos;s own low @-@ cost line Eu@@ row@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; under the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ ning in the South &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paintings by Le@@ ena Krü@@ ger in Künstler@@ haus are to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Finn@@ in , based in Göttingen for a long time , has compiled a selection of tit@@ ular works for the White Hall of the House , which encourage their viewers to embar@@ k on their journey thou@@ ght@@ fully .
Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United cannot play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brought the left out@@ lan@@ ders weeping and excluding him for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was embedded into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operate in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then plays fantastic , and then it happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it will take six months , and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the suspension of an el@@ m .
Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbitr@@ ator had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself when I say that a penalty and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a tweet to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
related to this : Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the UK Defender has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , everyone is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg frac@@ ture when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ c@@ u said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball rolling in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ dering by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a thing that all parents soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t last long before you know it by heart .
unless you &apos;re perhaps David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax , published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss , decided to publish his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or a message we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron said the story of the book , instead returns a summary of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text .
&quot; in the middle of the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , by reading her desire to see a real tree . &quot;
as if this would not be susp@@ icious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to being a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ b@@ able that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here , an un@@ named young , like the local environment by the gre@@ edy , trees , stum@@ bled , Th@@ need stri@@ cken once @-@ ler hears , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; is rav@@ aged .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row .
a down@@ ing street speaker said that the text had probably come from Cameron &apos;s constitu@@ ency bure@@ au .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened with the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
pushing to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , there is a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat on my map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not exclude a down@@ wards victory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Bat@@ ting list , and the shared spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is developing as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown quantity on test level , is an option for the attack .
based on this , Adam Ly@@ th will reti@@ re from the United Kingdom test cad@@ re and will be replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course hard to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but tough reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination because - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , the run of Ly@@ th would have been extended , but he had control over his own fate .
hopefully if he picks out further rounds for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there &apos;s another chance .
the England trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ lis@@ s praised his attitude , even if he did not get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test person gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven opportunities - like Sam Rob@@ son in front of him - while Nick compli@@ shed nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that could be raised was that England first deployed Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he &apos;s a hit man that I set up high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw early in Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very well .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this of course depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to beat mos@@ ques next to Cook , which would provide an extra bow@@ ler and get four squ@@ e@@ aks , appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a hit man can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a cri@@ cket player &apos;s devil .
mos@@ ques may not have completed his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop , before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred re@@ ps straight away and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited contact with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a punch , but there is no big number of backup spi@@ ders that lift their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some smart additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ e- , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advisor for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experience as he played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood is coming for the white sphere of the tour and brings energy and a powerful deployment to the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket contest , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can profit .
sometimes new voices in the locker room can bring fresh wind , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ ey &apos;s te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not set the schedule .
and you have to remember that as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made light hearted .
Bre@@ x@@ it ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Britain &apos;s exit from the EU ) could win on Zul@@ auf , if the economy is in a noisy situation by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ finished ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper into trouble with every day even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n as the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who viol@@ ently fought for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ at friend recently said that some member states are so deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , such as the EU is now and not always from their own fault , Britain itself created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive contractual changes that they usually do not wish to be satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Ministers climb summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend who wishes a UK looking outside in the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets you see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as happened in the exagger@@ ated long endurance races such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right @-@ wing government , Spain &apos;s left .
it is hard to imagine that they will tear a leg to help the sel@@ f@@ ie British whose energy is better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
that is why some of the ministers may intentionally not plan helpful comments throughout the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process susp@@ ects my boy@@ friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has gained nothing from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press @-@ cl@@ ones , as they did during the refer@@ end@@ ums inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entrance 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can be weak at Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists who have made a name for themselves as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 1990s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his ma@@ dness , Ed knew who his enemies were .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , phone chi@@ pper ali@@ ens and the pseudo @-@ non @-@ nationals who have the majority of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought similarly about her , but noted that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of going to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had rejected the principle of the un@@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who opened a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 &apos;s , a mistake back then and today .
it may take , but he has to develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC sofa he has left on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it in a friendly way - in the development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff division and the wild il@@ lic@@ it of Tor@@ ey Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can say yes to everyone .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell as Shadow Chancellor was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father tried to be il@@ loy@@ ally towards his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their Monday evening meeting .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even stir@@ red me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the stru@@ del of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right not to give Cameron free ticket to Europe that allows him to keep lab support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks that way .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be point@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , on which I was reminded of something about the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum at the start of Monday .
experts critici@@ ze Public Health UK report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
alle@@ gations of a government @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined the Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health UK ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fundam@@ ental Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y foundation &quot; on which he substanti@@ ates his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a detailed verification of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people called to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) in order to lead their opinions on the damages of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting have been sum@@ mar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously approved by British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T to Public Health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he has received according to reports previously received by the tobacco company Philip Morris International added them .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the board are not delivered , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide an industry funding in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting , the tobacco management of P@@ he took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products on most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or limitations will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims made by P@@ he that &quot; there has been no evidence so far that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been &quot; premature &quot; as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers .
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well@@ being at P@@ he , said that the BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are considerably less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
nearly 80@@ ,000 people annually die from a disease related to smoking , and smoking will cost the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
the clear provision of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ ers , says former head of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in harsh controversial time frames against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC general secretary , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also clearly be shown by non @-@ subsi@@ dis@@ ed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee as part of his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to hold the broadcast fee , which I don &apos;t consider in the medium or long term for a good idea , you should at least put your production on programs that others do not do or order .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve as wide support as possible for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax financing programs could be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ er@@ enders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
frank@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm for that .
I am trying to see how this should be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series that managed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s inno@@ c@@ ence was based on the ambition of people working there , and because they believe that this is the best way to ensure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular programmes give back what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gar@@ t lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows how to sell East@@ ers .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche applications should go &quot; to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue when they go to their hypo@@ critical missions for justification of £ 4 billion , &quot; Well , of course , we &apos;ve created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has ever seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee on the broadcast fee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course you all think , we all think that one gets a great value for 150 £ a year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 pounds , I wonder if that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also testi@@ fied before the committee on Tuesday called for the BBC to check their thi@@ an mission , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform , train and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little from BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example on public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada , for example , to &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful were shown on TV , and with the commercial channels Alli@@ ances go in to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des alter the direction at the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the stimul@@ i work by switching mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels which react to ultrasound waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms shown the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , which can be used ultrasound in order to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people for treating the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms normally do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani established that they did it if they were surrounded by a liquid with microsc@@ opic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the enhanced ultras@@ onic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells .
the sound waves effect the opening of these I@@ on channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry the TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applied ultrasound to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ ves@@ icles and transmitted to the worms , where they turn on the modified mot@@ onic zones .
the process has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with pulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which needs to be sent down to the desired place in the brain in an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves tissue can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent into the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are visible on bus stops and metro trains , which require a second look .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important announcement : depart from 15th to 18th September with the DL@@ R ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) one reads in the font types of the London Underground and the trademark of the DL@@ R line , which turns to the image of a tank . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the 300 posters are from artists who exhibited their work at the Museum of gru@@ es@@ ome designs in ban@@ sys specifications .

V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed by the silence around the advertising campaign for the weapons show - by a laying of the Excel calendar - and thought : &quot; let us give them the campaign that they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic and shad@@ y corporate advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ epr@@ ints with bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally on our door@@ step . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the most creative art around the Ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire comes from the area within Excel , where exhibitors convey fantastic euph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in residence halls
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ table 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those I have anno@@ yed - and the numerous , long @-@ lasting complaints about others .
most of what I learned can be di@@ sti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the entry into student resi@@ dences reaches from slightly irrit@@ ating to absolutely sc@@ ary .
it is temp@@ ting to chat : people tell wh@@ ence you come , whether and where you &apos;ve taken Sab@@ bat@@ ros , where you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly told Mar@@ mite do not love or hate because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like as opposed to those with whom you would not speak , even if your lashes were in fire and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people leave .
people often turn into drinks reception , movie night venues and communal meeting points , but they are also the places where people dress up and get their under@@ wear .
referring to this : don &apos;t remember to start with a relationship at the university
intro@@ vert will receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences are a space @-@ to @-@ space b@@ um@@ mel culture that can be friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friend@@ ships .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I love you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I receive the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is full of convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of t@@ apping .
speaking of speaking : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by che@@ eks .
since you start the university at the height of the back man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking at the doors of people to introduce yourself to a plate full of Brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have made you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain yourself and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poorly mixed cl@@ ots of flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping when you knock .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check that with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , that &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a pur@@ ge to her milk in order to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in jail .
they should not make noise , stopping people from sleep or from work .
it is not just about being a decent person , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people sitting in the glass house .
a girl on my hall@@ way asked her neighbours if it makes them a little bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more lou@@ der music .
when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly let her neighbors sleep two hours before she let her own music tum@@ ble , shut her door and went to her three hour examination .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse accidentally entered the same student residence ?
on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be very embarrass@@ ing if you have a room@@ mate ready for your future marriage partner , take care of them , separate themselves and then have to see them every day and perhaps experience how they pull together all together friends ?
of course the heart goes his own way - but if a hot fellow is definitely not your future wife , at least try to persu@@ ade your abdom@@ en to get a little reason .
in the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has left his keys in his not locked room , the border between an ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is more subtle than it seems .
a good bar@@ gain is funny , but it only takes moments to get to the bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never miss someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water which you put in the freezer - but stap@@ le their possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single mothers , low @-@ wage ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner builds semi @-@ detached houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees too - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need housing space , but also the educ@@ ating mother and the low @-@ ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to build cheap and well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are displaced in the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly cheaper living space can be created : he builds semi @-@ detached houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : mass housing in containers or gym@@ nasi@@ ums has no sustainability .
for people remain a great part here .
in view of the influ@@ x of refugees , we also need enough housing in the coming decades .
a very mund@@ ane , three @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed terra@@ ced house is the solution .
guil@@ d : a town@@ house needs the least space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different if you put people in blocks .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees say it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can easily be rebuilt according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
guil@@ d : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without property .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have dra@@ fted my project correctly .
especially complicated it always makes the threatening ladies &apos; sword special construction and the parking lot ordin@@ ance .
sp@@ oo@@ ky .
it is still under@@ represented who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in towns is there a lack of space .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
which is definitely not right .
but do you not exac@@ erb@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true , however : in the last five years we had a building boom in Germany , but built @-@ in luxury apartments that hardly can afford anymore .
my project has the message , even the normal people need housing .
not only refugees , but also the only educ@@ ating mother or the low @-@ ear@@ ner .
I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and good today .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after installation , because they receive an error message telling that the &quot; software update is failed . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able by linking the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do this by using a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone may turn off half@@ way and this may lead to a departure of the update .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only Dev@@ ise : full Attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows in the battle for the World Championship title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton only a motto : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup second stressed before the start to the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the runner @-@ up champion in Singapore before the night race in Singapore on this Sunday by defending champion and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on won seven of the twelve rounds of the season and takes the floo@@ d@@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Br@@ ite was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will affect Singapore &apos;s Grand Prix is still unclear .
for days , a ha@@ yst@@ ack is hanging over the city , caused by fires on the neighbouring island of Sum@@ atra .
bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
the Schach@@ club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; ( Chess Friends Bad Kis@@ singen ) , which was founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players .
the new member is the business@@ man Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bear@@ er of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1st class and honorary citizen of the towns of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
the Schach@@ club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann with a donation which President Alfred Klein received .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot impose the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent research should also be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his clos@@ eness with the spa town .
district Office looks for direct contact
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have joined together under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new stop at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides advice you can also participate in courses .
the social foundation runs from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , you will immediately receive sen@@ iors and advice @-@ seeking information on questions such as care insurance or health insurance benefits .
for years now , with our out@@ patient care service , we have established that often nursing families are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , many performances of the insur@@ ances are not taken into account because the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new house@@ wife Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a manager for the elderly and for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health care and wellness .
for this purpose the sal@@ u@@ dis were taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as crash prevention , memory training or physio@@ therapeutic treatment can be used .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both business leaders saw the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre especially in the demographic transition .
because this makes a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure in the individual parts of the city of Bam@@ berg in the future indispensable .
moreover , as Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined during the inaugur@@ ation celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the association &apos;s work : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular social gathering . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a great contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m .

Viennese architect Karl M@@ ang 92 years old
Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ yen of Viennese architecture , is dead .
he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus was sharing on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with M@@ ang , the Künstler@@ haus left an honorary member and at the same time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as it was called in the outside . &quot; &quot; &quot;
born in Vienna in 1922 , he studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna near Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War .
since 1952 he has worked as a freelance architect , but has also worked as a teacher , writer and institute director .
from 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design .
in the eigh@@ ties , he was commissioned to set up the treas@@ ury chamber in Vienna &apos;s Hof@@ burg and the conversion of the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ witz to the Austrian Theatre Museum .
park punishment : Tim Wiese th@@ rows a polic@@ ew@@ oman with money
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ex @-@ foot@@ b@@ aller Tim Wiese &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has died in Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
once upon a time , Tim Wiese , former nation@@ alist keeper in Germany and Bremen and H@@ offen@@ heim are involved , W@@ rest@@ ler .
according to his statement , he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years .
on the other hand , he was not intellectu@@ ally attached to it .
a meadow had just cut his hair in the middle of the Bremen city when he saw outside a parking space guard issued a ticket for his white Chevro@@ let Cam@@ aro .
as a result , the field stor@@ med off the business , insul@@ ting the be@@ amer and repro@@ ached her before the feet , as reported in the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper .
in the city of Bremen , one confirms the accus@@ ations , but it is not clear about the consequences for an unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after that will decide whether the meadow will be shown , or not .

men beating up to 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster . on Friday evening , around 23.@@ 45 , three young men were on the way from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , followed according to the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was located at the height of the b@@ ft @-@ gas station .
there were also three people on the grounds of the gas station .
one of these men cried out to the young man and struck this with his fist .
the victim suffered a nose of the nose and bleeding heavily from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the bat , he first dismissed them from his sacrifice .
from his friends the injured young man was brought home now .
the perpet@@ rator followed the group with a passenger car to the apartment and demonstr@@ atively passed several times over there .
when you didn &apos;t see the car any more , the injured man went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the bat and another male person .
the victim &apos;s face and th@@ ig@@ h were put under the help of a stick @-@ stick .
the injured had to be taken to a hospital for medical care .
so far only a vag@@ ue bag description is available .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second bat should have been about 1.@@ 65 feet tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police ask witnesses and advice to report to the phone number 06@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice in the field of field stops and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) assume the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ ausen .
furthermore , the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , business promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy .
in many places in the country are missing doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , has luck : there , on October 1 , Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice of field stops .
while Ur@@ sel is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich will be on hand for his successor in the next few months .
after a re@@ building phase , Müller opened the practice on October 12 , until then he invested 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was aff@@ ection@@ ate at first sight when the rock@@ ers met Frank Müller years ago and his wife , Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently completes their training in the Ver@@ den hospital and wants to enter into practice this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was time I just ph@@ oned them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Müller liked the idea of running his own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss .
and so they agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with the practice .
however , they continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller grew up there , followed his medical studies in Hanover in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed as a senior physician in the Di@@ ep@@ holz district and is engaged in an honorary position in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19th , the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ic@@ ausen is working as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ acional ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both intern@@ s , want to settle down as a general practitioner .
&quot; the endos@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load EC@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
in addition , the computer is completely renewed .
a subsi@@ dy of 50@@ 000 Euros will be given to the Müll@@ ers as part of a subsi@@ dy programme of the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice continues to be continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes Sam@@ t@@ commonly Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , approximately 2000 patients come to the field of field breaks every quarter , in North German average practice it is approximately 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another GP practice .
a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ ausen , the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor would have found it , it would have gone too .
who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s talk hour , inci@@ dentally also continues to look familiar to familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the field stops .
with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all , the doctors have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we only had two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel said , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she felt a little sad@@ ness already after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the boarding school . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed myself against gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and is happy to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also on our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to make a asylum claim can do so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also clear that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people must know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it takes a controlled procedure .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to leave incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
in this way , Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar did not see this in Lai@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia will intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ian wants to prevent its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government shared , the first refugees had already tried to go past the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia in order to avoid registration .
the Croatian police were able to attack her in the neighbouring corn fields .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik has been constantly gathering police vehicles with new refugees .
it is mainly Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country expects about 4000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo were diver@@ ted to the border of Macedonia on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which previously led migrants to the Hungarian border , reported Croatian and Serbian media unanim@@ ously on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it was to instruc@@ t people to take certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , in the morning , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border city of S@@ id , in the course of the day additional buses would be expected .
via Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants had been on the road all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border with Serbia approximately 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has agreed , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could actually lead to the predicted shift of the former Balkan Route between Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west route .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for exceptional circumstances in the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not design@@ ate details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive border control options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you carry out strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia has been a member of this since 2007 ; since then , the EU partners have consistently testi@@ fied to the country &apos;s standard of border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Serbian side there are still around 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
Serbian interior minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm him down early on Wednesday at a local eye in Hor@@ gos : he held the debates on the alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be very high refugee figures at this time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous alternative routes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still not yet cleared mine fields 20 years after the end of the Croatian war .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock exchanges h@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians will pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber@@ crime , which is accused of having provided an insight into yet un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the information collected , insi@@ der businesses should have been made at the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the investig@@ ators were sum@@ mon@@ ed over $ 100 million in total .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately trapped , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 other accused in the case continued .
most of the defend@@ ants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetrators are alleged to have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe .
E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
there is a lively operation around the Mannheim @-@ Par@@ ade@@ platz .
the people perform their err@@ ands , partly fast pac@@ ed , partly comfortable bo@@ omer@@ ang .
they control the two stations of the Mannheim car park at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep city run@@ ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; pul@@ s@@ ating , boun@@ cing life with wonderful autumn sunshine and in the midst of four big tables with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Before I die I want .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ remedy drew attention to her 20th anniversary with this action and is quite faced with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went into the city and people with the action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and talks as the volunteer workers .
while some p@@ asser @-@ by spontaneously interfer@@ es with the chal@@ k and adds to the sentence &quot; my life be@@ j@@ ah@@ en , &quot; &quot; stop war &quot; or &quot; do not suffer long , &quot; others remain short , read , say phrases like &quot; I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again , small discussions about the action take place on the periph@@ ery , about life , how to deal with death .
also Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I make clear that at some point the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic work Mannheim , which is working together with the Car@@ it@@ an Association of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Aid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this public @-@ effective action was good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the fact that not everyone wants to express themselves publicly , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death is still frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped a lot to open up people .
an estimate that Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid shares .
the funeral and mour@@ ning companion belongs to the volunteers of the first hour .
through personal experience confronted with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid was looking for volunteers , she immediately reported to her and had been there during the founding in 1995 .

F@@ ed@@ Ex result bl@@ ended , financial prospects lowered for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the Gi@@ ant Gi@@ ant extracts its outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its body transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire some 5@@ 5.000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by over 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said that a gain between $ 10,@@ 40 and $ 10,@@ 90 in the financial year ended , which ends in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
according to a survey by Fac@@ t@@ Set , analysts expected a total of 10.@@ 84 $ .
the lower prospect will come in spite of the price increases , which will mean an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on January 4 , and despite a higher rate of bo@@ unds for heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November .
the company said that the result was still expected to increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and growth in online trading .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company considers &quot; solid income if one considers weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the plans for vac@@ ations were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , who plans to employ 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter that ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which predicted twelve analysts at Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales rose by 5 percent to € 12.@@ 3 billion .
analysts asked six of the analysts expected to $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipments , which brought sales in its unit express shipping to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
sales were 29 per cent in the last quarter , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger par@@ c@@ els and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result declined due to higher labor costs in the freight business .
in the pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0,@@ 15 .
on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on its most anticipated conference in the year , Federal Reserve Strate@@ gies spend two days a week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the benchmark for the first time for almost a decade .
a mur@@ al of the United States is located at an end of the decorated , two @-@ story session hall .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair@@ person Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues intend to put the nation &apos;s economic interests in front of all other things .
the central bank has a double mandate from Congress : keeping US employment and prices stable here .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be re@@ conc@@ iled by the unprecedented incentive by the close to zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the economy &apos;s data show that it is solid , recent tur@@ mo@@ il on the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxious to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal securities - and be it only by a quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they observe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Chief Econom@@ ist at the Mak@@ ler@@ firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which uns@@ ett@@ les the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists , who were recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , predicted an increase in interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial Test jumped by 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed Policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that point , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
even a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed good to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in the spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the sentence expected .
although the job creation slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was sound this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macroeconomics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world met at the end of the month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average figure fell by more than 16 % in May , as investors feared a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now nearly 10 % below the peak of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ence influences the complex calculation when one should increase interest rates .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks , they would tigh@@ ten the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff member of the US staff .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; O@@ liner said .
the health of the global economy is not the primary concern of the F@@ ed , so it should not be considered technically in its decision making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed &apos;s monetary authority has become the world .
in recent years , the influence of the central bank has been enormous .
the mere hint of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; close &quot; their monetary expansion caused confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also advise other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , observed this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that apparently are not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
acqu@@ er , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who advoc@@ ates a raise in interest , made decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its benchmark interest by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited noticeable effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lack@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives declined these cuts .
the F@@ ed should focus on aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the Mark@@ tz@@ us@@ ammen@@ bruch in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the interest @-@ fixing of Bank of England .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il does not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she fears a rise in interest because markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t think it should rush ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little help for refugees
more and more refugees come to Germany these days .
to prepare a warm welcome is not without the commitment of inn@@ um@@ erable voluntary hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
they include Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
even with her 74 references she still likes to teach .
every Thursday she does it at the asylum seekers &apos; heim at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , this is completely different from a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s pedi@@ atric society Rio Grande fo@@ sters nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS attempts to educ@@ ate women in a sho@@ cking manner how important good nutrition is during lac@@ tation . it does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck in breasts that are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary supplement that mothers should carry out .
a recent study led by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the building application for the 2.3 million Euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may become flat@@ ter for solar panels .
the planning for the long @-@ awaited Turn@@ halle building at the Bern@@ ese Sports Field is progres@@ sing step by step : in the latest municipal council meeting , the elabor@@ ated building application was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the Panel had previously decided on an application for an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was about permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with a non @-@ mit@@ och@@ ial first and roof@@ top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
background of the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar installations : &quot; in this way , we get a wonderfully large south roof , &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again about the roof @-@ cutting , which for energy reasons - different from the development plan stipul@@ ated - should lie below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan does not allow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the roof ti@@ lt - whereby the general council generally restric@@ ts Bern@@ rie@@ der &apos;s com@@ mon@@ wealth rather restric@@ tively . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in gymnas@@ tics , however , it is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym@@ nasi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a joint project between the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
at costs , some 2.3 million euros have been calculated .
subsidies are expected from school and broad@@ band sports .
in the next step the building application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall is now presented to the District Office for the examination .
hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time Dr Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees pull from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the Land@@ kreis GmbH of the county , which confirmed the land@@ lady Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision will be made by the Supervisory Board , and it will meet on Wednesday , September 23 .
should the plans be implemented , then all of the 50 employees at the Hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would be busy .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the further In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who do not have access to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees are informed of the plans .
Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year , has now moved to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
on the question of who is to succeed , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead on 1 October and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means an &quot; appreciation &quot; in every case and an extension of the offer in the area of &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
Fischer special@@ ises in pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases at the In@@ ner Station .
for the next two years fisher@@ man with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees , will lead both houses until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ens , which has more than 35 beds , is to be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the county had planned this for 2018 , when the current renovation at Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital has been completed .
Land@@ rä@@ tin J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also the chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the federal government , will hen@@ ce@@ forth be used as accommodation for asylum seekers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shut it off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss has not been able to say , there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a conference psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer on the move to the Le@@ ch , which was received by the employees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years has not been given .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital ( once 100 beds ) has repeatedly been threatened by closure in recent decades , departments have been closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .

missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate for Saturday .
in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted having killed the youth and threw their cor@@ pse into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 year old , missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , has fallen victim to a violent crime .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office and the police on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , also arrested on Tuesday evening , is considered to be susp@@ icious , who , according to him , admitted to the police and led the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after they had not come home after a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators initially met with personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the case of interro@@ gations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing people , there was a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the presum@@ ed perpet@@ rator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ pse was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee reported to the police interro@@ gation that the 16 @-@ year @-@ olds were killed and the cor@@ pse was placed in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put a dead stop to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investigation on the closer circumstances of the action is intended to bring further investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees need accommodation : study warns against apartment gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking an affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction is facing a challenge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
with incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many major cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units will have to be built by 2020 .
this is the result of a study commissioned by the Association for &quot; Social H@@ ousing . &quot;
for comparison : 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished this year in Germany .
thus , 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in a first @-@ class accommodation .
many then come across the housing market and join the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , less than half of all asylum seekers were available for rent in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes considerable savings in the housing development policy of the past few years .
Germany is shooting down a housing shortage , which is increasing from year to year .
currently , some 77@@ ,000 units have already been missing in the con@@ ur@@ bation areas , including Matthias Günther , author of the study .
for this reason , many professionals were forced to live in large cities in flat @-@ sized rooms .
young adults ab@@ rup@@ tly stayed longer at &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; due to the exposure to the housing market .
in the big cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has declined again for the first time in recent years .
in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; social housing construction &quot; proposes a re@@ boot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new incentives should boost social housing construction again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the property tax could be wai@@ ved and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats is subject to temporary exposure .
in addition , attractive tax write @-@ downs are necessary according to the alliance .
the funding programme for refugee shel@@ ters at the state bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the around 300 million euros were already set up on Monday evening with € 18@@ 4 million .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free travel : Croatia and Slovenia set up Cor@@ ridor
there is practically no escape to Hungary , since more and more refugees choose their way to Croatia .
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the passing through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous though .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian Minister of the Interior , and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
following the deportation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have been displaced to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV channel RT@@ L .
on the eve of the day Hungary had sealed off its border for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws that came into force on the same day also make proper asylum procedures in Hungary superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
but there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning the Croatian police took up the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the neighbouring Croatia .
most of them came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came with the bus as well as with taxis in the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border , the refugees do not come across borders .
the border strip bears other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a safe passage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , after the closure of the border , Hungary has hardly any more refugees .
on Tuesday the police numbered 3@@ 66 .
shortly before the closing date on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hungarian laws classi@@ fy the overcoming and damaging of the border between us as a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
sentences are threatening prison sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; Tran@@ sit &quot; on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition from R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants , there are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees .
practically no one has a prospect of granted asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to ti@@ dy up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected garbage that tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side in recent weeks .
the barrier guard was disman@@ tled and one of the shooting @-@ camps in the border area was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express himself to the goal of this conversion .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria reached only a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants were still in the country , according to the government .
in Salzburg around 1400 people wait for the continuation of Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by the instruction of German authorities .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mayor drove &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; str@@ anded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; across the border &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we were busy after the Brü@@ cken@@ fest on Sunday with the clearing , when ten people suddenly stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor , Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany was surprisingly hired on Sunday because of the influ@@ x of refugees with Austria , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the border together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Na@@ he Passa@@ u .
before we visited the unexpected guests , we had lunch and drinks .
we said right away , we bring them to Passa@@ u by car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man was not allowed to don@@ ate a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the train passengers who were str@@ anded on Sunday evening switched from an ICE into a regional train to Passa@@ u , in order to see it after the short notice that the railway traffic was stopped to Germany , but still trying to cross the border .
the regional train was set off before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest linked with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , Sunday before a two @-@ back @-@ run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends more Z@@ ig@@ ones to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy : &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of helping the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately in the construction of structures that guarantee humanity , our Federal Chancellor has officially and openly moved the attitude of the Hungarian government into the ha@@ ze circle of National Socialism .
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted in the border areas with chaotic conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a major challenge in the face of the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter , to produce decent conditions for protective seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ tight quarters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad has all hands full to do with the job of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight .
the government used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to set quarters for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the world premiere of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not have homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master power &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as well as the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crisis @-@ like situation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 copies in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 units will have to be found in the next few weeks - 20.000 are to provide the Länder , 15,000 of the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial capitals .
they had promised him to create neighbour@@ hoods even for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , to be clari@@ fied as the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations into the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping as we &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform individuals can easily offer accommodations .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are vac@@ ant in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for housing as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in times of emergency , there can be no need for districts to comply with a certain height of the towel rack or the size of the duties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must apply for a temporary period of time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he was more successful when accommod@@ ating , Konrad with his experience reas@@ oned .
I am an elderly man , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not charge the Republic as they themselves stated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees in three to four .
up to now , our own search for a district has not been successful .
Konrad wanted to set up a container on the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with hom@@ olog@@ ation .
Linz calls for a better division
for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the victims are currently unable to take these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , further sites should be tested for emer@@ gen@@ cies in case of an emergency .
criticism of the city chief on the division of the refugees within the federal state .
other districts also have to contribute here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; borders are not sealed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a longer telephone call with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , the Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday ordered further action in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders were not sealed off .
the on@@ ward journey of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist .
however , the protective seekers would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria now also takes control at its borders is for P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the procedure of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a Mat@@ ter of Time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general refur@@ bish@@ ment of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new shi@@ py@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz industry line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T has moved into , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine investing in the new shi@@ py@@ ard startup companies , and later to acquire some of them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - which is what Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
EUR 1.7 million has been invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the State of Upper Austria and the Federal Government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building has been le@@ ased from Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of residual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are en@@ quiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second business in the ar@@ cade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve market ar@@ cade : after all , she has gotten gain in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , in which they sell among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks were rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I thought for a long time whether I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision was , among other things , that Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Region that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have even Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest has put Br@@ eit of her mother into the cra@@ dle .
most of all , when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why some woman in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ tures , the expert can also not answer with last certainty .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag of every outfit will be upgraded .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are named An@@ ders .
this feature links some also to the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ sets .
whether it expresses itself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , journalists are concerned or gaps in knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office stimulates the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cuts well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate market are coming from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öhn@@ fris@@ ée &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term for many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine route . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ village is related to it over -@@ eigh@@ ty corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the caus@@ ative act@@ ress Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting , but are not so pro@@ found@@ ly impressed in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; species , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ stadt has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous s@@ ap@@ lings , to which besides Tr@@ ump the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz belongs .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
to the king of the hearts he didn &apos;t bring it there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is respect for the family &apos;s performance , but also tend to think that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a little &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the surrounding area , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to High German : the don@@ or , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
the jump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a place for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the foundations of the real estate group were the first real estate in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their home dur@@ ably failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged then .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because once he had been without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ atine History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , was declared a film start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descend@@ ant .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; as pol@@ lin@@ ated , it &apos;s not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of the b@@ umps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement has rather dis@@ soci@@ ated the American , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so cau@@ tious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he think that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension enti@@ t@@ ess Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm mentioned as many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ at a visit , which was generally good .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they would find it better if he did not win the election , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ ws at the time of his grandfather in the United States would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting subjects than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ emaker Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not my president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe even without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wen@@ dels &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 movie @-@ go@@ ers , also in the US w@@ akes up the interest .
the Upper Bavarian town of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
the 1800 inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday from the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing villages &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the neighbouring country the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have at most 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the ratings , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son hurry to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has been no big shifts in today &apos;s ratings .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broadcast by the state capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull created the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a one @-@ week series of international television programs including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the resistance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , because Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 viewers in the five main cities compared to today today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , Today delivered a slight increase over ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number fell short of last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise .
in August today , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 3@@ 30,000 Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the gap between 40,000 and 50,000 went on .
so far in September , Sun@@ rise has an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 viewers at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning men more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former ser@@ ge@@ ar of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father who decides to settle with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of last night responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and easily hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , presented by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe in an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ 000 ) .
on Monday night , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour , 7@@ 20,000 was reached .
hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the Qu@@ otes of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a substitute for a million dollars minute that didn &apos;t manage to beat the Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Show .

the final three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor .
the woman who finally lands at Sam Wood in The Bachelor was sh@@ rou@@ ded in secret sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who has received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows the day before out of three two , you may have accidentally given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood holds his lips sealed up to the final on Thursday
all three women were ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could their answers become a gam@@ ut who won the heart of the b@@ achel@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both called fast - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
from the very first day , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship with each other .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought it all over the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay thinks she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home visit last week made her clear that wood could be &quot; the One . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now set un@@ condition@@ ally on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who Wood would choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zzling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor &apos;s b@@ achel@@ or will be broadcast on 10 on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ nes for the rest of the game on the bench , when he lost a don@@ or as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by league convert during his first pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also in the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
in his press conference , Tom@@ sul@@ a also publicly supported Hay@@ nes in his press conference .
the 49@@ ers sports re@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his crazy catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ nes and his massive Australian ent@@ our@@ age had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ nes left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you only care about the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ nes compared the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut back then in 2007 when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 year old .

the Free elec@@ torate calls for the hi@@ ring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high refugee figures .
party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W Aut@@ umn Conference in Gros@@ sw@@ stadt before a severe crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , when there are not new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get links in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the Free elec@@ torate takes place Friday to Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian commun@@ e .
actually quite different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the free elec@@ torate meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the issue of asylum will over@@ lap the retreat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as was during the Yugoslavia war in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we have to look at the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Elec@@ torate General . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one the free elec@@ torate as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded more personnel for the administrative courts responsible for asylum applications : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W leader critic@@ ised that several states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform federal standards across Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria push@@ es away , others don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the state policy in the city of great city should not fall under the table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a long lasting burner stays on the agenda : education policy .
for the new school year , Ministry of Education Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot project &quot; Inter@@ mediate Class plus &quot; at 47 gym@@ nasi@@ ums in which an extension of the secondary school level from three to four years will be tested .
but that doesn &apos;t go far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all gym@@ nasi@@ ums that want to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot;
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever it is desired .
wall Street helps Da@@ x to jump on le@@ aps
the German stock market has concluded with profits after a long stretch of trend @-@ free and nervous trade history .
it was only in the afternoon that a firm pr@@ el@@ ude to the US stock exchanges caused a clear trend which ultimately promoted the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points .

accordingly , investors hardly paid attention to the German chip manufacturer .
investment in future @-@ oriented waf@@ er technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot at prot@@ esters in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot a crowd of people demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ expan@@ i district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ hak@@ al , senior district administrator , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside of a police station , and some of them threw stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ hak@@ al said that the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before they resor@@ ted to rubber missi@@ les .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , known to be able to kill , which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ rid@@ i say that new provinces that are formed within the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th century .
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been governed for centuries .
working on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but law@@ makers ha@@ sten@@ ed the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the plot at the Em@@ der Jugend@@ zentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meters surface .
a mix of trade , trade and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market around 4000 square meters of land in direct proximity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
it is planned to use the area for a mixture of trade , commercial and living .
one is waiting for suitable offers , that is to say on the part of the city .
which investor would be questioned is not yet clear .
no contracts had yet to be concluded .
the town of Em@@ den had purchased a part of the property , which is located on the Ring@@ straße / corner Große Straße , already a few months ago and demoli@@ shing the building on it .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning of the holiday settlement on the small sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor publicly presented plans for the project for the first time .
some residents are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure territory
for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , g@@ ag@@ ged , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now there are plans for a new holiday settlement on the little sea near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prospective , medium @-@ sized company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System @-@ Bau &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the City Development Committee of the Em@@ im Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , which accused the investor and administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ unk left the system @-@ building management into the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the council members and over 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now .
the ten to twelve million euro project has been in discussion for months .
intense reactions among sea owners who had come to the meeting called out the pictures and new details about the desired hotel construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea and a member of the board of interests of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z that over@@ looks all the other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , as some other project critics , he fears that transport would increase greatly due to the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be whole bus loads , so that it pays off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the well one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant , however , is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ unk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans are still variable .

Google starts dou@@ bling donations campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google , Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling campaign aimed at raising the $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees fle@@ eing from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google has an unusually personal approach to the announcement of the donations call on his blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of making a manager announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee , who had fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark web and bus rides , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing aid to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations to a value of 5.5 million will be doubled to goo@@ gle@@ .com / for $ 11 million .
Europe is being confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has distributed over 4 million people this year .
many also escaped from the war torn apart by war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for overweight diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if slightly obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery that wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb nutrients .
over the years , obesity operations for type 2 diabetes have proven to be efficient , but most studies have been performed in people who have been fat@@ ally obes@@ e with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng general hospital collected data that they have collected in a study since 2007 , comparing two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c ul@@ cers - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatment approximately the same at 29 .
among those who underwent surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabe@@ tic disease completely dissolved in 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved in only one percent , and in part , only about two percent .
in addition , the results of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol were generally better in the &quot; surgical group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood levels of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , reflecting the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , prescri@@ be the researchers .
after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical treatment group , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better gly@@ cem@@ ic control , as reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level , did not reduce mortality in five years , according to the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results of the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater returns in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3,@@ 1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported rather a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavy people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was about 29 per cent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was re@@ ass@@ uring for people with a BM@@ I of 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their physicians should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think once they have accumulated such genetic changes that have attached their body to obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a topic that is becoming increasingly popular in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly in school hours , meets the flock of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ wei@@ lers and the surrounding villages .

&quot; it is impossible for anyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader was calling for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford devoted to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that anyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany &apos;s and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and found out that the violent reaction of the United States attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush and I told him the way to resolve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence , and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase in intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the past 4 years
toxic control centers in the US report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years who swallow strongly alcoholic hand dis@@ infection agents , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of recei@@ pts of hand dis@@ infection products in children under 12 years of age who report toxic control centers increased from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them are landing in the emergency call , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children were deliberately drinking disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ing in social media .
videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants just because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have allegedly mixed dis@@ infection products with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash@@ es to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ infection products ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very attractive for children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in small children , few spra@@ yers can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison control centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 transmitter in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p around whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four spra@@ yers from straw@@ berry sm@@ elling anti @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was brought into a emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally considered to be drunk by an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey said a emergency doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah ble@@ w her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl was fallen by alcohol and had stum@@ bled across the head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store hand@@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as active ingredient .
in January three students of the fourth class in the State of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by spreading anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the failed plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary action against the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former ran@@ ger mid @-@ field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they do not show highlights of the Celtic games anymore and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what interests them .
there is a lot of tension in the old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , Dei@@ la swe@@ ars .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic has to fight , but the Norwegian chef s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen was followed , who now stand at the top of the table with five points ahead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what &apos;s happening .
we feel this exactly like that - but we have to go on .
we really need the support from Celtic , because that makes players better .
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton carefully in January @-@ transfers
despite his commentary only a few weeks ago , which indicated that he was making a number of January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious about the signing of new entran@@ ts and insi@@ sts that he does not want to interfere with the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x @-@ Ka@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players who come in summer have this pre @-@ season period to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic target person Mich@@ u with a return reference
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation , indicated that he could withdraw if his contract exp@@ ires at the Sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pla@@ gu@@ ed with a ti@@ res@@ ome k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les for two years and did not finish the departure from Wales this summer .
Hear@@ ts closed on S@@ FA battle due to N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s comments
the Hear@@ ts took 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of the defender was later aboli@@ shed - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have not commented on performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le
the Im@@ mov@@ able Hi@@ ppo was rejected after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive texts about former Hear@@ ts Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the area of Ros@@ eb@@ urn , Edinburgh , in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the stor@@ mer , and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is certain to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ slu@@ r if it doesn &apos;t play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tan@@ na@@ dice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s board of directors still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but admit that the decline in the field has to end .
I think that Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the boys back to Tra@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es was glad to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; win &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Hamilton . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team from Aber@@ deen desper@@ ately needed to fight against Hamilton Tac@@ cies to see a seventh consecutive League victory that brought them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ &apos;s el@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues that have won &apos;t win games of this kind either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it is rising overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July , unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 per cent , as shown by the National Statistics Office ( ON@@ S ) .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent , a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labor market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken dis@@ rupted the sequence
as security personnel could not paci@@ fy the situation , the staff called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray , the officials could take the stur@@ geon in custody .
a breath alcohol test resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0.@@ 89 pro@@ mil@@ le .
the growing boy was picked up by his mother .
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2,@@ 15 pro@@ mil@@ le and stayed at first in custody .
why I am witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I shall see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope it does not happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see backgrounds in the US , and as more applications are available as seats , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery is held to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps close friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you &apos;ll get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have formulated it better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kim Bell@@ bird , a re@@ porter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all the details .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of action .
but I believe there is a strong chance that he is not guilty of murder .
I am sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters to contact .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die of unnecessary death .
man after the police chase is persu@@ aded to come out of the c@@ anning river
the c@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman was dry when he talked about the man from the c@@ anning river .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to det@@ ach the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were sum@@ mon@@ ed to a break @-@ in incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le.@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ vec was not too fond of making his uniform wet , so he applied a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polish is negotiated &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le.@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ben C@@ ous@@ ins &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; championship football player offers an unforgettable example . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the tren@@ ches to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of Ben C@@ ous@@ ins @-@ Bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards trying to spy on him and threaten to finish racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he pointed to the ste@@ wards and the integrity section of Racing Victoria and claimed that they performed a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching by Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax media that he always tried to do what was best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobal@@ t @-@ t@@ amp@@ i test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he held back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age alle@@ gations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look up like too high hanging grapes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have been eating for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it was going on .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk up@@ lifted heads , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more coaches .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
prior to that , Moo@@ dy had brought the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had attempted to spy on his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago , Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; Moo@@ dy said to rac@@ ing@@ .com .
they obviously believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if this is the case , they should surely touch their n@@ oses because they failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , reign@@ ing president of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this take me to the point that it becomes personal ?
has the R@@ V@@ L beha@@ ved cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and inf@@ ringe me , and I have no doubt that what I say can now be thought upon .
but I have arrived at the point where I don &apos;t care , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have been set up with the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t investigation in Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching resulted in saying that he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; laugh@@ able &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s bill , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s against racing rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my colleagues wrong@@ ly put mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been like last night .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so .
but it was also on the day of the race .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the day of the race . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it &apos;s a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy hits against ri@@ vals due to claims about w@@ rest@@ ling
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agenda setting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rators allowed the Storm players &quot; Ring battle &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday night .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a scarcely concealed note on the Storm team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g &apos;s team and said they were only concentrating on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the tac@@ kling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading coaches in his team was confident that they worried they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; this comes up again and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about w@@ rest@@ ling when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have not changed our def@@ en@@ sive system or techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real focus and this has provided the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not used to losing it , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it &apos;s funny how this occurs again and again at this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the premi@@ er league in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wa@@ yne is talking about exciting football .
he played his game on Saturday evening with our Friday night and how exciting their game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he &apos;ll take care of a mess .
but now he has a team that can play and that we look exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play once you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all of his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like this .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more tries in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points something exciting ?
for me it &apos;s the game plans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Storm team is free on this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday evening at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday .
beer with 200,000 US $ deposit after drug delivery
a man who could potentially have a life @-@ long punishment due to his attempt to get into the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a $ 200,000 security deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested in the last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and arrived in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole crowd and that in the cafe could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the risk of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its declarations of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ates his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports to the police daily and considers a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A@@ 5 at Karlsruhe : cab tear@@ ing apart
in a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the highway 5 in Karlsruhe , a truck driver was severely injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to move to the left at the last moment , as the police told them .
the driver &apos;s cab is completely torn apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
a damages amoun@@ ting to 12@@ 2,000 euros were incurred .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used telephone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of an 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone as this slept , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of non @-@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl a@@ woke later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping squ@@ ad .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately alert her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered &quot; concerned &quot; web searches that used words to search for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es on the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be addic@@ tive to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said that it was happening because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and which he asked to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was ill in his head when he drinks , and said he wants to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying .
it then looked at the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ant with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said the accused used computers and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty on the basis of the indictment , to have taken in@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year , to have viol@@ ated the obligations and not to appear before the court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defense attorney Greg@@ ory S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg would not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , argu@@ ing that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be found in his transgres@@ sion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael conf@@ esses judgment by October to get background reports on social work .
Ho@@ gg was granted a deposit in this case but was held in custody pending charges for other cases pending .
he was taken up before the date of the judgment into the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
bad users switch to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are picked up off the border control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many of the floo@@ d@@ gates made out of fear of discovery and arrest the people increasingly on smaller border cross@@ ings .
on the Austrian side , a spokesman of the Federal Police said .
more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the Land@@ kreise ( Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn ) since Tuesday .
they had come to the German side by foot over bridges and du@@ st@@ les .
there they are received by Federal Police officers and for@@ warded to the registration .
compared to the beginning of the week , more refugees arrived at Munich central station in comparison to the beginning of the week on Wednesday .
around 700 people have arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 a.m. , a spokesman said in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , the city reached 17@@ 59 refugees on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest &quot; &quot; &quot;
meteor@@ ologists warn of storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area above Western Europe , warm marine air flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) reported in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was pulled over the Atlantic over the last days from the Bermuda Islands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
heavy storms and storms are expected in Baden especially .
according to DW@@ D , up to Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake Con@@ stance with bends of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour is to be expected .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again longer .
the mass makes it : every two years the car makers show their novel@@ ties at the IA@@ A .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2015 is especially noticeable in the compact cars that are currently being sold very well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the compact class cars are currently particularly popular : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the German Federal Aviation Office ( KBA ) in August alone .
this is also reflected in the IA@@ A ( Public Days of 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , many new compact models will be show@@ c@@ ased between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car sector is the Opel Astra , which will be available at dealers in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive either .
Rüssel@@ sheim / Munich . Opel has an entry into the world &apos;s largest competitor , VW Golf , which starts at 17@@ 650 euros .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are human @-@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given a right to an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee of the Te@@ gel At@@ tor@@ ney General , who was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
as a result , an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was lod@@ ged in a solitary cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally .
after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , was now on the free foot , had been reloc@@ ated to a larger cell .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , his liability against the state of Berlin failed because of the di@@ gni@@ fied detention conditions .
but the Constitutional Court raised the judgment of the Chamber of Appe@@ al in Berlin and re@@ mitted the case back to the trial .
they see man &apos;s dignity hurt .
Kammer@@ gericht - now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of arrest were decisive for the compensation , a compensation claim was given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chamber court must now clarify the amount of compensation .
in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners .
so they spoke to a prisoner of damage only in April because he was locked naked in a cell .
according to a Dec@@ ision of 2011 , the multiple assignment of a cell without a separate toilet is un@@ worthy of human dignity .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had an in@@ humane accommodation in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the then cla@@ im@@ ant was accommod@@ ated every day between 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Car@@ ls@@ bad case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines because of missing personnel .
det@@ ain@@ ees are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to ra@@ cket should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Justice Press Office , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to young shortage of young people , 19 should fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Justice this year , some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is capable of accommod@@ ating one million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated decisi@@ veness in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can create that and we create that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany is the following overview .
according to different forecasts , between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) flats are used annually - for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as has been built so far ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , especially with affordable rental properties : annually , 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social apartments are out of the rental price connection , and these particularly favourable homes will also apply for refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
this is much too little from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : eigh@@ ty 000 social apartments each year would have to be created and the federal government would have to invest EUR 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , scientists and federal government departments agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 per cent of the people in Germany can be employed in Germany over the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualification to help them get started , Claudia Walter critic@@ ises , project manager for integration and education at the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees it is crucial to find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the intake society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says migration researcher Dietrich Margar@@ er@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , according to Thr@@ es@@ hardt , there has been a political change : from the prohibition of working for refugees to the recognition of labour .
while there was a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years earlier , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just as the residence requirement for asylum seekers is limited to a place of residence .
in society , also because of the shortage of skilled labour , the view that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster - also because of shortage of skilled labour .
lack of knowledge of German is a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
research also shows that work@@ places are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
the construction of networks is therefore , according to Thr@@ es@@ hardt , the royal road to work integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few escaped parents give their children to the put@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the de@@ pu@@ dent parents , it is very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ esch@@ bacher , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the need for a large number of refugees is rising sharply , the Berlin Senate will try to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more specialised schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared in the course of their classes .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate &apos;s suit@@ case from Berlin &apos;s school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal state does not prohi@@ bit asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , the interior sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for refugees with a residence permit or Dul@@ dung do not receive any benefits after the asylum application Act if they start a study .
the latter basically do not receive a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to attack .
tolerated refugees had to have lived four years in Germany so far to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ g @-@ justified , from 1 January 2016 to shor@@ ten this span to 15 months .
but this gap also needs to be closed , as Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually grant the same rights to Islam as the churches have , and the existing state @-@ churches right to develop a new state @-@ religious relationship .
the establishment of an Islamic welfare organization , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers , would also be important .
the rights also include duties .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree to clear contacts and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and give him some control options .
this also includes a willingness to fight against religious fundament@@ alism .
the President of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany .
those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany immediately &quot; have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
in this way , the majority society will also have to change , the exploitation of discrimination and racism is more pressing .
indeed , Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination point and a general equality law for a decade .
but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U series of mur@@ ders showed that the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and stakeholders require for a long time and why international treaties such as the anti @-@ racism Convention in Germany obli@@ ge , must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is in a position to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees , says Dr Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it comes to power and capacity , we create this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system for this .
in order to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery encourages all newcom@@ ers to hand out healthcare cards right away .
services rendered could later be accounted for by the federal states .
and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to send as many people with the limited catalogue of services , which the asylum seekers Act prescri@@ bes .
apart from that , the doctors are mainly making the language barriers .
so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are more aware of their illnesses than other patients .
not only in clinics but also in medical sur@@ geri@@ es , interpre@@ ters need to be taken over , it demands .
many refugees would have been helped but also with more general medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
among refugee children , for example , there are clearly more un@@ treated im@@ pedi@@ ments , and for the young people it is about HIV education .
in some cases , German doctors would come from their training , but it is clear that Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery believes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the lack of doctors , it may even be allevi@@ ated by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed educational system , many refugees are even doctors .
in order to be allowed to practice , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill after estimates of the Bundes@@ psycho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study conducted by the Technical University of Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee fund is trau@@ mati@@ sed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffers from so @-@ called flash backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart@@ beat and death thro@@ es .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong rigi@@ dity and emotional de@@ af@@ ness .
to prevent the symptoms from being chronic , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
up to now only four percent of the mentally ill refugees have received psycho@@ therapy .
while psych@@ ically ill asylum seekers in the social offices can apply for psycho@@ therapy , the treatment usually lasts several months .
in addition , in the social offices mostly cler@@ ks or doctors , who are not trained for mental illnesses , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
with the new production &quot; Passion &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts .
the goal is to captiv@@ ate every age group with captiv@@ ating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream up in the man@@ ege on a brick .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ hr@@ erin and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - this is the motto of the current fashion staging . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family for more than 33 years .
the gift for fan@@ atics is thus in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to pick up people from their everyday routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ at@@ cocktail with cosmop@@ olitan flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme convin@@ ces with talented artists from all over the world .
excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
the Cuban duo wants to take up the Cuban duo with the heroes of silent films .
light@@ ness and agi@@ lity - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts by storm .
apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ts , the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and agi@@ lity .
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
for He Yu@@ an no problem .
sn@@ ak@@ es@@ men fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascin@@ ates with their agi@@ lity .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stresses Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it &apos;s not good for our animals , it &apos;s not good for us either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each match unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called lovingly , will be read from the eyes whenever possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena as well .
so the upper@@ most command : good for the animals .
especially on their zeb@@ roid JU@@ M@@ BO , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra @-@ stu@@ ds , the family Pro@@ bst is proud .
the two animals lived together in one enclosure for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether five or more 200 spectators , we always give our best and are there with all the heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst will be inviting you to your ideas from 17 to 20 September every day at 17 and 20 o &apos;clock .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced .
the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe maintains false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread quickly over social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by alle@@ gations of opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them of accompanying Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen .
last month , they cut him out and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokesperson for the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said journalists after Mu@@ gabe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it warns the members of parliament that immunity should end in parliament and as soon as they leave parliament its parliamentary immunity is no longer effective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will replace up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to have 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
this year HP will split up into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing enterprise hardware and services business activities .
the expected job cuts lead to a burden on more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ President and Chief Executive , who should guide the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses supporting companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ successful , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; a statement by the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce electro @-@ technical equipment and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage was called &quot; the birth@@ place of Sili@@ con Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to manage the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field based on the belief that closely focused companies can deliver better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ate in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb must stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger emphasized Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only in September , and as long as his rehabilitation progres@@ ses according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and in the face of its history , his participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain .
the big shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing back during the season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
it is a bone that does not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was only an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger acknow@@ le@@ dges , there is the associated risk of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of the arsen@@ als 15@@ 7 league players in the last five times .
the broader picture for Arsenal is that they were in six out of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded the most injury days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time in which you must strengthen your body and win fighting strength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves .
arsen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb against the matches against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , which means that Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are allowed to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and treat the players who need it to take a little break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although arsen@@ al is clear favour@@ ites to pass through Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has been launched last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale 3 : 2 .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsenal has pulled the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capital surrender to Monaco and remains driven by far @-@ off hope to lead the association with its management to its first European Cup .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
arsen@@ al has never worked out .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show , which gave us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before , as self @-@ murder rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 @-@ 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the fight to tackle this challenge .
a recent study involving more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a healthy mood , his chances of recovery were doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends first , so that friendship can work .
in the era of communication led through social media , with its emphasis on substance on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation is domin@@ ating .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that has a much deeper impact on our spiritual health .
and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire before recently declared money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which spark@@ ed through the interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football gu@@ cks in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the y@@ earning of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it even though they are often reluct@@ ant to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the telephone ministry told me , &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; My role for people who feel de@@ pressed and su@@ ici@@ dal is really shown to me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one talks about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .

di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to crush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ mond Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria will make his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ mond Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main launched his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prince &apos;s Park stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as a PS@@ G player who made the French master the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani made a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sha@@ kt@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris takes a strong start against the Swedish master , as it does not only aim for the kno@@ ck@@ out for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club with which he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or outside in the Champions League . that &apos;s why it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause problems and look back relaxed , even if there are certain things we need to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t scored another or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , which last weekend could hold a 2 : 2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was described as the man who took the PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , when he was taken over last month by Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he ended up in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ ti &apos;s pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he ended up in Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great win , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , played at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was faced with a five @-@ man defense and two deeply in the middle field lined up a heavy opponent .
but apart from a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &quot; posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G sometimes gave himself up , with some mis@@ ses and bad degrees , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who only scrat@@ ched in the first half with no less than five attempts and then was abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ starting .
nevertheless he proved much more skill if he brought his team@@ mates into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shoot , which was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the H@@ ours stamp thanks to Cav@@ ani . thus , the Urugu@@ ay@@ an scored his sixth place after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi replaced a gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualifying games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Glen@@ core raises $ 2.5 billion through share sales
the Swiss @-@ based mining giant Glen@@ core , affected by the collapse of raw materials , accumulated $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday through a stock sale as part of its huge debt plan .
the London registered company Glen@@ core stated in an explanation that it sold new shares worth about EUR 1.6 billion to pay off its own debts .
the company , which has lost 57 per cent of its market value this year , struggles with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn push@@ es demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
the issue of rights rights brought a rapid rise to the top of the London Stock Exchange on trading in early Wednesday morning .
the share jumped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which was 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Glen@@ core last week announced the $ 2.5 billion share selling as part of the more extensive plans to settle around a third of its 30 billion dollar debt .
the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the group .
concerns about long @-@ term growth in China have dropped iron ore prices around half , coal , copper and other commodity prices have declined by 20 to 40 percent .

Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , the White House confirmed in an Declaration on Tuesday .
the visit , X@@ is &apos;s first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and reci@@ eves President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement .
the US President and the First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a State D@@ iner after the two leaders have conducted bilateral discussions .

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented switch to FC Bayern in 2008
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since the summer of 2015
a few years ago , FC Bayern was just ahead of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who at that time played for the FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times winner champion , four times champion league winner , twice champion champion , twice European champion , twice world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to Qatar as al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he was already ahead of the European Championships in 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything at that time , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is also the case for the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer from Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reminder : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann was taken over by FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the crucial man for this is now working for the German record champion : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Gu@@ ardi@@ ola and I played a great European Championships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s how he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s playing time was running with X@@ av@@ i 2008 / 2009 .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the entire distance on the grass , out@@ dated the Red Army ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph .
Matt Dam@@ on playing down variety in film creation
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown while discussing the diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night by HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , when this stressed the need for alternative perspectives , emphas@@ ised a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in filling the film and not in filling the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted dis@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . OK &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would like to invite people to think about it - who will always be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown first said .
the only black person , and she is a gro@@ uted , beaten by her white dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the producer of Dear White People set himself up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that their direction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could give us something we don &apos;t want &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Po@@ oni &apos;s Twitter user expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the twe@@ et has earned more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments arrive at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement achieved national impact and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discri@@ min@@ atory practices against coloured content .
in February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album still weaker , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement published an explanation as a response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ sts invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos; crown the first champion
professional sports climbing and operator aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday night and took the Grand Prize of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which concluded its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant , who was able to complete all stages of its obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the final .
climbing on a 75 @-@ foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds belonged to the last task .
Brit@@ ten completed the task at the time he was the first athlete to complete the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge in three seconds faster , making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock of winning the Big Prize of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never deserved more than 10,000 $ or had life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of a sudden ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he was the first ever to finish the course , did not receive any prize money .
according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful prize and life changes , he receives the great grat@@ u@@ ity .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll have any res@@ ent@@ ment over it .
he has just been so happy to have done what he did .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac felt the same if they had changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or was extended for an eighth season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit tiger sne@@ aks past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers were reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the T@@ wins gave up a chance to climb within a half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to grasp on a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all wins make fun no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad E@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon er@@ ect his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw at the bull@@ pen every game , so I want to go very concentrated into the game .
design@@ ate tiger @-@ j@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits vs the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the sle@@ d@@ geh@@ ol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aus@@ mus said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( punch training ) , looked much better out of the bull@@ pen , and he put it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns at the end of the seventh inning the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy &apos;s left @-@ h@@ anders .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran walls , the only man he was confronted with , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who left the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a two @-@ run .
with a pair of runners and the end run at the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe into a double play .
it was the 27th time this season in the Major League that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe proposed Double Play
when Detroit added a Garden @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inner ings , Wall created a R@@ BI double against the loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the status of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ hand side , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano in three Pit@@ ches for his fifth S@@ ava .
Detroit benefited from the opening of the game by an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been painted before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he had been missing for more than a month due to a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the start I wished , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt better when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first , H@@ ushes released a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z led Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z scored his 0 @-@ 21 series of successes with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing Position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos was followed by a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second one , a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single from center Fiel@@ der Anthony Go@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mo@@ li@@ tor .
he didn &apos;t beat very well , but he got the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es it came to three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four strips .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired because of a violation of the school lea@@ vers .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z Sh@@ oul@@ der in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list due to a shoulder dis@@ ruption , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z out of the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is removed from the list of injuries to fight the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing on the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are expected to come in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the residents of Wiesbaden should then be housed in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city Wiesbaden shared on Tuesday evening .
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital were prepared for this event in the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stay there .
they are then to be distributed to other municipalities .
over the last ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse , responsible for the initial up@@ take , have arrived in H@@ esse .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that resol@@ ute thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective way@@ points &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago we were glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce of a military involvement in Germany passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive escal@@ ation of international assistance to refugees .
Austria controls at Southern and Eastern borders
in Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
on Tuesday evening , Austrian Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner announced that no one will be sent back to Hungary .
Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it &apos;s so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement in which Germany could receive a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said that there were already discussions between the General Director of Public Security and representatives of Germany .
she did not call her concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their destination is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU leaders , asked for a special summit next week .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees at a special meeting on Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the strong refugee movement in Germany , the Federal Government wants to support countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chanc@@ ellery of Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined that those people who needed protection would also be ashamed of it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a pencil &apos;s eye view , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view was unanim@@ ously divided in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now face a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest that the border with Romania would also be brid@@ ged by a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from crossing over Romania , said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , however , eye witnesses reported thousands of other migrants on their way to the Greek border .
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ice cream of the Satur@@ n@@ moon En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean sp@@ lashes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what researchers conclude from observations of the space probe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the moon is therefore easily stag@@ gering on its path around the ring planet .
although this movement of pi@@ geons is small , yet too large for a continuous cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) of Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technical sheet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a long time it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the South Pole of Saturn in 2006 , sp@@ it water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the south pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers then closed .
however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not clear .
R@@ ama is missing 1860 München several weeks
the 1860 München had to give up around a month on offensive player Val@@ det R@@ ama .
the association with the 27 @-@ year @-@ old revealed an investigation into an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury .
R@@ ama had been compla@@ ining about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich &apos;s Lion , the diagnosis means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presumably four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a bitter loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a united pro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Six@@ ties at first presented a defensive man as a training guest .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was previously under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at currently has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet fruit - gos contain lots of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slim line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because man@@ goes contain relatively high amounts of sugar , especially su@@ c@@ rose .
healthy are the exotic fruits nevertheless : in them B vitamins and the vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ur@@ sor beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits are thus suppor@@ tive of vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and should be consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go , however , also gives sav@@ our@@ y dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some let@@ tu@@ ce salads such as ch@@ ic@@ ory and ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .
the US parcel service U@@ PS imple@@ ments up to 9@@ 5000 aid for the Christmas business in the USA .
the company has already started recru@@ iting seasonal workers , U@@ PS shared with them on Tuesday .
above all drivers are looked for .
as early as last year , U@@ PS increased its workforce by 9@@ 5000 aid to the holiday season .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business U@@ PS and its competitor F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making arrangements since last year to be prepared for the Christmas business .
in 2013 , delayed deliveries had introduced the parcel services to harsh criticism .
first fo@@ eh@@ n storm , then prominent cold front
the night falls in the valleys of the Alpine north side of the F@@ öhn through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland shared on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and on the night to Thursday , the F@@ öhn blows partly with storm strength through the herd valleys .
after fo@@ eh@@ ing on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front which brings strong ra@@ ins , wind gu@@ sts and a drop in temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area above the British Is@@ les in a strong southwest current .
on the side of the Alps , the F@@ öhn breaks through the valleys during the night .
as a result , the F@@ öhn blows up to Thursday mor@@ nings in the com@@ promis@@ ers with bends of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ i land partly also with more than 100 km / h .
the hair @-@ dryer can reach up to the neighbouring Plateau , and even hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on Wednesday , stor@@ my hair dryer guarantees summer@@ y temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow at the mountain@@ side .
rain starts here , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , South of the Alps must be expected in the next 48 hours with some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter , which has already fallen in large amounts of ra@@ inf@@ all over the last few days .
on Thursday morning the F@@ öhn winds the air , in the episode a cold front rolls with a strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east via Switzerland .
along with the cold front the wind re@@ fres@@ hes strong to stor@@ my , and the temperatures rise significantly .
the following days are coming north autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , on the weekend sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ place
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Square in Rome .
in the presence of city president Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , on Wednesday a so far nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an der Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is right in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Working Group of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es often only live in secret their faith in the city of Pop@@ es for centuries .
with this place , it becomes visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held a few months in Rome as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 .
he felt the city at that time a ver@@ itable sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
according to historians , his negative impressions could have reinforced him in his later fight against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the split@@ ting of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses on aband@@ on@@ ment .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) crown of thorns is one of the main works painted by Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with splendid images .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 75 @-@ year @-@ old has received his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colors and imagin@@ ative shapes - but what is not at all equal with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective topics , this can be quite glo@@ omy .
for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he met a subjective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; Book of all Books . &quot;
the result is cycles dedicated to themes such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , commandments or pat@@ ernity .
he has therefore spontaneously fascinated more than one partner : the same applies to Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its emphasis on art books .
and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the biblical passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Scrip@@ tures selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into today into current contex@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts &apos;s painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible text of Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
this allows the 75 @-@ year @-@ old to get a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant mi@@ stress Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was education already with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up so that I may also be able to bear with the Lord &apos;s father again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to bring art to more value in the quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is marked by advertisement today , and that is loud .
symbo@@ lis@@ m is sup@@ planted there .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewers to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the images , let them work , discover and sense the power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for its counterpart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , was &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
I did not care to fully grasp the Bible , but chose the most important , also mysterious themes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the picture , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar &apos;s images speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( Bibli@@ cal ) language of love as well as those of responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on November 15th .
start of construction for BM@@ X railway is approaching
plans made , place found , company commissioned to model earth moun@@ ds for a circuit : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X , it was already finished .
failures in politics and administration ensured dr@@ one , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
so hills de@@ ported , new place looked for - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the approval will be made in October , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first coun@@ cill@@ or , Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck , was able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees by 2019 , and the Bundes@@ liga made a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football responds to the worsen@@ ing situation in Germany and sec@@ ures policy to tackle the problems that arise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this the biggest challenge in our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can say in principle , that &apos;s not about me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to every individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he plans to intensively discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the chan@@ cell@@ or next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. O@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced .
football can and wants to help .
but the decisive course must be policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association therefore has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Stiftung , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professionals will sign a clear sign when they will carry the im@@ print &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s Head of Sport Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler in the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama is going on everyone , nobody can see it away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , we must use our bla@@ sting power , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale on the European Quali@@ fication Game against Hungary this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a big joint work of German football &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license agreements in their places had started their own projects is great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this year and the next year , the association together with the DF@@ B @-@ selection and the Federal Government provides 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have also called for the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : in the event of accident , SAP executive board loses an eye
the head of head of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
after the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he almost ble@@ ed , was power@@ less , and then dra@@ gged him out into the street - this he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to run the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full of my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner all the time , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer at the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up once you &apos;ve fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen other than skir@@ mish ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered an appropriate photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
he therefore arrives at night race in Singapore on the weekend as little as a reserve driver for the two Stam@@ b@@ ill@@ otes Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button in@@ quired , as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
junk@@ ie without R@@ eus against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : pasture cellar at the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback by Marco R@@ eus have finally broken down in the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the soccer league in Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
given the high burden of its professionals , Tu@@ chel will not only alter its el@@ event@@ h position at the R@@ eus position .
so he announced a change on the goal keeper position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of gene@@ alog@@ ist Roman bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher compli@@ mented the world champion .
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in use in all European league games in the future , however , Tu@@ chel kept it open .
with a high probability , he will also play the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ sche statement by fellow players R@@ eus that the final kick for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl considers it understandable : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s why Marco is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants to play a pioneering role for Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the change of cars .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Frankfurt on Wednesday at the Autom@@ esse IA@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , who come together with representatives of industry at the IA@@ A .
the strategy paper by the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a spe@@ edy transition to digital radio .
there is currently a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria to test new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; avoid any additional liability risks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government intends to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; review and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to make use of the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only fores@@ een man as a driver .
in automated driving , the car is increasingly taking the lead , the driver becomes more and more a passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways will be technically possible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are to be expected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far after 2020 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authors of the study estimate the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany location for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the issue of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the drivers &apos; personal data must be clari@@ fied clearly .
but the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still look scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the investig@@ ator Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect it at all in 20 years , 31 percent believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed are counting up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , 33 percent in the US .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the Bit@@ kom digital network , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could still be 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team@@ - and double @-@ start at table tennis @-@ EM
according to the current status of the title fight , the Düsseldorf @-@ based Düsseldorf wants to open only in singles as of September 25 to October 4 .
the final decision should be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time , Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term arranged sponsor@@ ship in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to come back on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ bat@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the cast list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the European Championship 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo lost , and we became European champi@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the world ranking fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins which look frigh@@ tening thanks to video projections .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it used to be ble@@ ak , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen at Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung from September 18th , it is a pleasure that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition was a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about as much more than beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Die@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly visible work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not constructed , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed overall art work for which much effort has been carried out : to fr@@ inge the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers sent 14 tons of material to Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special treat : a leather h@@ osen outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he always cared for strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashionable Geh@@ versuche of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
his parents couldn &apos;t have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught the ej@@ ection of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at designs from other designers , such as Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought it , of course .
for his first own fashion show he couldn &apos;t pay the models .
they got nothing but could keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of Gar@@ net - P@@ lau@@ ener tip as fashion niche
it used to be on the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were made in large quantities for customers , which they for example processed to blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone doesn &apos;t work anymore , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the P@@ lau@@ en family .
instead , fashion is again important .
fashion played a major role in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ en peak , and was then pushed away by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt called some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories like bags and regional costumes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vintage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fashion , which is borrow@@ ed from past bull po@@ ets , is an increasing order potential . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has no niche in the textile branch in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
toy shop P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been cut off .
there is almost no shortage of private specialised shops and wholesale stores .
our products hardly reach customers in this way .
nowadays , the mass goods are manufactured much cheaper in the Asian region and are distributed almost exclusively through chains .
in addition , exports are weak@@ ening , up @-@ to @-@ date to Russia and the United States .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score points with environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains of the Nit@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we are launching a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch of the University of Applied Sciences in Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and lace .
to counter@@ act competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and firms that need to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ marked the historical snow@@ ball point .
the machine ticks little spheres in some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lau@@ dry Gold@@ schmi@@ ede@@ master in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration from it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before , I couldn &apos;t do anything with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in an elaborate process , she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Reu@@ ter says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who want a piece of mem@@ or@@ abili@@ a .
so I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends are not to be touched , but nevertheless Disney vent@@ ures to a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not about a new movie but a kind of sequ@@ el , which takes 20 years after the first movie with the magic n@@ anny .
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director is already convinced : Ro@@ b Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods , &quot; in the cinema .
XI pointed to opening the economy more broad@@ ly for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy must open wide to the outside to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday a group charged with steering the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should be committed to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and promoting reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new place for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list regulating market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that do not question investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is important as it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , guaranteeing a right @-@ wing business environment and designed the market more open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the company and ensure that companies decide how to manage their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , additional areas for private investment will be opened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded businesses and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to guarantee the right of the lawyers to exercise their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated in the meeting as reported in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit value in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and therefore expect a significantly higher dose of the tox@@ in for consumers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Consumer Organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who has a corresponding EU working paper , sharply critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full impact on pregnant women and infants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t at F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as sh@@ arks or s@@ word@@ fish , should be raised from one milli@@ gram of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
big car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es are already so heavily loaded with mercury today that , on the basis of the still valid limit values , about 50 percent of catches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ available .
in return for this e@@ asing , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to intensi@@ fy the limit values of other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch , however , described this as &quot; plo@@ y &quot; because smaller gra@@ vey@@ ards , such as car@@ p are usually so low , that they comply with the planned maximum values already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of small fish is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dy distra@@ ction that alone helps the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , which is strongly enriched by the food chain especially in predat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; low volumes are particularly vulnerable to ne@@ on@@ atal damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Ministry of the Environment declares on its homepage in view of the applicable maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury enters the environment primarily through coal combustion .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power stations report more than six tons of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total amount emit@@ ted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceeded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March from paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU @-@ warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
