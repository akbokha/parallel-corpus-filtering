considering that it is necessary to make additional measures with regard to a smooth functioning of this agreement ,
in view of the regulation of the Swiss Federal Council of 23 December 1971 on the use of the Swiss name for watches ,
in view of the close industrial cooperation between the European Economic Community and Switzerland in the area of the watch industry ,

1 . the raw materials produced in the Community , which are listed in the agreement included in the Agreement , as well as the components manufactured in the Community and other parts of the movement produced in Switzerland or in the Community , are deemed to be of equivalent quality as raw materials and individual parts of Swiss manufacturing with comparable technical characteristics .
clo@@ cks and watches made up of these pieces and parts have to meet the requirements of statutory technical control in Switzerland .
2 . the list of raw materials produced in the community is revised periodi@@ cally following the following mod@@ alities :
a ) The application for acceptance of new raw material cali@@ bres in the list is directed by associations of the watch industry of the community or the manufacturers of Roh@@ werken based in the community . the application is to add a technical description of the raw material cali@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Swiss watch@@ dog carries this or the new cali@@ bers immediately into the list above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the inclusion in the list for a raw material cali@@ ber is applied , which has already been used in Switzerland and the legal technical control in Switzerland has not existed , the Swiss watch chamber can reject the recording .
B ) The with@@ drawing from the list of raw materials listed in the list is communicated by the associations of the watch@@ making industry of the Community or by the manufacturer who had previously requested the admission of the Swiss watch chamber .
C ) If the requirements of statutory technical inspection in Switzerland are not met , the Swiss watch chamber can request the filing of the relevant raw material cali@@ bres from the list ; it teaches this from the party concerned .
if this does not agree , the procedure may take place within two months of the procedure in accordance with paragraph 3 .
D ) Any request for change of the list according to the letters a ) , b ) and c ) will be immediately displayed to the Joint Committee of the Swiss Watch chamber .
3 . in order to meet the quality of the quality , the Joint Commission , provided in Article 9 of the Agreement of 30 June 1967 , is immediately seized by the concerned parties with the matter .
the first acting party is looking for the official quality control in the Swiss watch industry and a corresponding qualified institute of the community referred to by the party of the Community to have a common report .
with regard to this app@@ rais@@ al , the institutes agree to take from a Swiss company and a company of the community a game of watches or movements , which is sufficiently representative and basically no more than 50 watches or movements .
after checking these games according to the norms of legal technical control in Switzerland , the institutes compare their results and create a joint report for the Mi@@ xed Commission with their conclusions and with their event@@ ual proposals .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the agreement and the protocol together . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures to be applied when implementing the Part I provisions on securing measures .
the aim of the hed@@ ging measures established in this agreement is the timely detection of the bran@@ ching of significant quantities of core material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear fis@@ sur@@ es for unknown purposes and deter@@ rence from such a branch by the risk of early detection .
for reaching the target specified in Article 28 , the material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , verbal and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the examination by the organisation is carried out by an explanation , in which material quantity , which is not proven for a specific period of time , is specified with the accuracy limits specified for the given me@@ gen .
in carrying out their follow @-@ up examinations , the organization according to article 3 makes full use of the securing system of the community .
the accounting and control system of the community for core material according to this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
in the application of their backup measures , the community will make use of de procedures and measures of the following kind and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are more determined and useful in the supplementary agreements :
a ) a measurement system for determining the quantities of preserved , manufactured , lost , lost , lost or otherwise from the stock of removed core material and the stock of stock ;
B ) the assessment of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures to determine , test and evaluate differences in the measurements of tran@@ smit@@ ters and receivers ;
e ) procedure for the assessment of concentrations of non @-@ measured invent@@ ories and not measured losses ;
F ) a record and reporting system , which points out the core material inventory and the changes in the material balance zone for each material balance zone , including the one and outputs of the material balance zone ;
( g ) precau@@ tions to ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) procedures for the reporting of reports to the organisation in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures according to this Agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
B ) the origin - or th@@ orium @-@ containing material that the phase of the nuclear fuel circle described under letter c ) has not yet been reached into the states , the association of the organisation shares the quantity and composition of the material , provided that it is not implemented for non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves the core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity of the fuel production or the is@@ ot@@ ope accumulation , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or if this core material or other core material produced in a later phase of the nuclear fuel circle is introduced into the States , it is subject to the other provisions mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The hed@@ ging measures envis@@ aged in this agreement are terminated for core material under the conditions stated in Article 11 . if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not fulfilled , the association is not possible or desirable from resi@@ dues , so the organization and the community consult each other about the use of suitable safegu@@ ards .
B ) The hed@@ ging measures envis@@ aged in this agreement are terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community agree that this core material is practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
on request of the association , the organisation fre@@ es the following core material from the securing measures following this agreement :
a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material when used in grams or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
( B ) Nu@@ clear material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities after Article 13 if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ op@@ ic concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
on request of the association , the organisation fre@@ es core material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures according to this agreement , of these hed@@ ging measures , provided that the core material quantity liberated in the states is at no point at any time .
a ) a total of a kil@@ ogram of particular p@@ alt@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of his weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with an accumulation , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the nature ur@@ anium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of accumulation ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an accumulation of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) 20 metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an accumulation of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if the core material is to be delivered , processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to the securing measures after this agreement , precau@@ tions are made for the re @-@ use of the backup measures on that material .
the community meets with the organisation of supplementary agreements , which are required in the scope , which is required for the successful and effective realization of the tasks of the organization according to this agreement , in individual terms as to apply the procedures established in the Convention .
supplementary agreements may be extended or amended without alter@@ ing this Convention in agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements are in force at the same time or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts so that these agreements can enter into force within nin@@ ety days following the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the take @-@ up between the organization , the community and the states .
based on the initial report mentioned in Article 62 , the organization publishes a summ@@ arized app@@ rais@@ al of the entire underlying core material in the States , irrespective of its origins , and carries out this inventory on the basis of the subsequent reports and the results of their investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other .
the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is imp@@ eded by general resource transfer problems .
C ) The aim of the E@@ EC and the Member States is that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound to force the agreement within six months , and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The E@@ EC and the organization have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the mean bonds to ensure a wide and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the E@@ EC organization has presented a table that is inten@@ tional in which way it intends to apply the criteria set out in this agreement -
the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; Special Account &quot; that consists of the funds which the Member States will contribute to the special transaction account . this account is governed and used by the organization as administrator , only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement .
the special transaction account is managed separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment shall be made in the form of cash or in@@ trin@@ sic bonds issued by the member state , which are payable upon request in the currency of the relevant state to order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited in the organisation in the country concerned .
B ) The payment shall be made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contract within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the Administrator appointed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to the 1 January 1979 or at another time , which has been agreed between the E@@ EC and the administrator , taking into account the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Any Member State may wish to pay the payments before the dates mentioned above .
according to the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator takes about proportion@@ ate drawing on the cash or the school j@@ acks to cover the expenses for the special transaction and to balance the special transaction account appropriately .
in case of granting such loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the E@@ EC conditions :
( III ) the extent in which international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further credit capacity to loan terms without dis@@ agreement ; and
VII ) the extent in which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
every transaction loan is used to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly out@@ sour@@ ced development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral proposal ) , which is assessed , approved and managed by the organization financed by ordinary means of the organization , and the objective of the addition to this agreement is to be taken into account in this agreement ( b ) .
the funds of the promotional code may not be used instead of ordinary funds from the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization , which has been approved within the framework of a loan or credit for a program or plan approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force .
apart from Section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same re@@ payment conditions , which are generally applicable to the organisation granted by the organization ; they are thus re@@ payable in 10 years each in 50 years .
transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are re@@ payable in these currencies .
amounts for payment of this watch are to be paid directly to the organization that it retains .
any special transaction loan can be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the funds is stated .
the proceeds from any special transaction can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services manufactured or produced ( i ) in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization and which according to what the administrator decided at the time of the loan granted , could be the recipient of a promotional loan .
capital re@@ payments of special transactions are transferred to the special transaction account , and the amount paid back in this way in the currency of a member state shall be re@@ mitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned .
until the full disclosure of all special transactions , the Administrator obli@@ ges the E@@ EC to pass on the plans and programs approved by the directors for the examination by the directors .
during the period of the withdrawal of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the E@@ EC teaches quar@@ terly about the development of the special transaction loan and the expenditure for that purpose .
as soon as possible , the Administrator im@@ parts the E@@ EC as soon as possible after the completion of the financial year of the organization a detailed billing of the transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account closure .
after full payment of the promotional loan , the administrator of the E@@ EC will send a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account as soon as possible .
the administrator creates and conduc@@ ts appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which are issued from the account recei@@ pts to the account paid and paid out from the account , and the re@@ payments to the Member States are evident .
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ akers work closely to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
for this purpose , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the Administrator up to the full issue of the means of the special transaction account from time to time lead to an exchange of ideas on the status of the special transaction account , the progress of programmes or projects that are funded by the action , and on any other questions related to the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement entered into force on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date , which the E@@ EC and the organization were able to agree upon , the agreement and all the obligations resulting from it shall become invalid with immediate effect .
if the total capital amount is paid back to the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC according to the proced@@ ural rules of each party .
the governments of the Member States are noti@@ fying the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude these procedures .
the Secretary @-@ General conduc@@ ts these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the proper authorisation of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the Organization further .
this agreement becomes effective and occurs in force on the first day of the month , which follows the day of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications at the organization .
this agreement is written in two manuscripts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch . each wor@@ ding is equally authentic .

the agreement could be closed up to the total amount of the fee paid by the credi@@ tor , within a total amount of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 bn invo@@ ices ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future distribution funds of the member countries .
already now , however , some conditions are mentioned below , for which application the BI@@ Z would be prepared .
with each stand@@ by loan , the BI@@ Z would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extending extensions without being exceeded for a total of five years .
in the opening of the loans as well as in the possible extension , the B@@ IS would charge a credit @-@ opening commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first draws are not made before the exp@@ ir@@ ation of the Stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the drawing would take place in the currencies available at the BC@@ Z at the end of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would be negotiated in consideration of the means of the bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those handled by the BC@@ Z at the respective time on similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to the market rates .
if the BI@@ Z needs to acquire the necessary funds themselves on the market , then the interest rate applicable to the application could reach a maximum that corresponds to the corresponding margin of Li@@ bor .
I would be grateful if you would like to share with me the approval of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the B@@ IS could close a stand@@ by loan agreement with central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks put an appropriate application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would inform me about the approval of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine Republic on trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat
I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set up provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the joint market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community .
- fresh or ch@@ illed chicken - , lamb and goat &apos;s meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &apos;s meat from Argentina to the community are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in car@@ c@@ ass weight ( 1 ) .

the import charges for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this shall be taken into account under the number 5 testi@@ s of de@@ ple@@ tion .
the total amount mentioned under number 2 will be determined with the day of Greek accession to the Community on 23 000 metric tons of battle body weight .
the community under@@ takes to avoid a market development that could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ inian h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat in the common market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the community meets provisions so that the paragraph of intervention stands on frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation does not under@@ mine the sales of Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ el and lamb . &quot; &quot; &quot;
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other support measures for the export of hammer and lamb , as well as for slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , take place only at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the world trade with these products .

Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular by placing export lic@@ ences specified in this agreement for the products referred to as number 1 .
the Community comm@@ its itself to take all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issu@@ ance of import licenses for the aforementioned articles is subject to the origin in Argentina on the basis of an export licence which is designated by the designated authority designated by the Argent@@ inian government .
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a security deposit will be wai@@ ved for the issu@@ ance of the import licence for the goods .
in addition , the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority responsible for the responsible authority of the Community in regular intervals has prescribed the quantities for which export lic@@ ences have been issued ; this information may , if necessary , en@@ code to the country of destination .
the committee is responsible for ensuring that the agreement is properly applied and functioning smoothly .
he regularly reviews the tendency on the hammer , lamb , and goat &apos;s market of both parties and on the world market as well as the market conditions on these markets , including conditions that are of importance for the purpose mentioned below number 7 .
the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of this agreement will not be affected by the fact that products made of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &apos;s meat are carried out according to the Community under the agreement .
the Committee discusses all questions arising during the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual quantity stipul@@ ated under number 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December .
the quantity valid from the entry into force of this agreement to the 1 January of the following year is determined in proportion to the total annual quantity and takes account of the seasonal character of the trade .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand , and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the one hand .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that date , it remains in force , subject to the right of every party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a deadline of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes that they consider necessary for necessary .
I would be grateful if you would share the consent of your government for this .

with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand about trade with H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &apos;s meat
I honor the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to set up provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the community in conjunction with the application of the regulation on a common market organisation for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &apos;s meat .
in recognition of the fact that the sheep economy and the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb are exist@@ ential after the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy and that it is necessary to ensure that the normal he@@ el of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and lamb is not affected in these markets , I honour to propose the following agreement :
the agreement applies to : - fresh or cooled chicken - , lamb and goat &apos;s meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
after this agreement New Zealand will ensure access to the market of the community in the amount specified in the agreement for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &apos;s meat .
new Zealand gets the assurance that the normal he@@ el of his hammer and lamb is not affected by the application of the regulation .
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand comm@@ its itself to ensure that the amount actually executed does not exceed the set amount .
the amounts specified below are executed in the conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the community ass@@ ures that New Zealand should not be prevented from using new technological developments or maintain its competitive position on the market of the community .
should a change in the offer form be possible due to changes in technology and trade , then the two contracting parties consult each other before introducing such a change in the committee mentioned in clause 10 to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community takes the protective clause , it comm@@ its itself to protect the interests of New Zealand resulting from this agreement .
in the event that imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country .
the association comm@@ its itself to reduce exhaus@@ tion on imports of products written by this agreement to a Ho@@ ech@@ st rate of 10 v.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
when new Member States are joined , the community in consultation with New Zealand changes the quantities fixed in clause 2 according to the scope of New Zealand trading with each new Member State .
the import charges for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this shall be taken into account in clause 5 of the aforementioned pou@@ ch of exhaus@@ tion .
the total amount mentioned in clause 2 will be set to 2@@ 45 500 tons of battle body weight with the Greek accession to the Community .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the community is making provisions so that the paragraph of intervention stands on frozen meat is not under@@ mining due to the implementation of the Regulation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the two contracting parties undertake everything to promote the consumption of sheep in the community without any danger to market stability .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for the export of hammer and lamb , as well as for slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , take place only in line with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of the world trade with these products .
new Zealand guarantees compliance with the quantities mentioned in clause 2 in particular by issuing no export lic@@ ences beyond these amounts .
the Community comm@@ its itself to take all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issu@@ ance of import licenses for the aforementioned products with origin in New Zealand is made dependent on the submission of an export license which is issued by the designated authority designated by the New Zealand government .
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a security deposit will be wai@@ ved for the issu@@ ance of the import licence for the goods .
in carrying out provisions , it is also stipul@@ ated that the competent New Zealand authority publishes the quantities in regular intervals , for the export lic@@ ences have been issued ; this information may , if necessary , en@@ code to the country of destination .

- fresh or ch@@ illed chicken - , lamb and goat &apos;s meat ( F@@ act F@@ ee 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the Common Custom@@ s tari@@ ff ) ;
- Fro@@ zen h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &apos;s meat ( F@@ ed F@@ ee 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the Common Custom@@ s tari@@ ff ) .
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &apos;s meat from Uruguay in accordance with the Community are set to the following annual amount :
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Uruguay agrees to ensure that the actual amount of annual production does not exceed the agreed amount and is carried out in accordance with the traditional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
should a change in the offer form be possible due to changes in technology and trade , then the two parties of this agreement consult each other before introducing such a change in the committee referred to under number 10 to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community takes the protective clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the access to the Community market regulated by this agreement is not affected .
in the event that Uruguay imports exceed the agreed quantities in a year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year .
the association comm@@ its itself to reduce exhaus@@ tion on imports of products written by this agreement to a Ho@@ ech@@ st rate of 10 v.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
in the accession of new Member States , the community in consultation with Uruguay is changing the quantity stipul@@ ated under number 2 according to the extent of Urugu@@ ay@@ an trade with each new Member State .
the import charges for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this shall be taken into account under the number 5 testi@@ s of de@@ ple@@ tion .
the total amount mentioned under number 2 is set to 5 800 tons of battle body weight with the Greek accession to the Community .
the community under@@ takes to avoid a market development that could imp@@ air the marketing of Urugu@@ ay@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat in the common market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the community meets provisions so that the paragraph of intervention stands on frozen meat is not under@@ mining due to the implementation of the regulation the paragraph of Urugu@@ ay@@ an creativity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other support measures for the export of hammer and lamb , as well as for slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , take place only at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the world trade with these products .
these terms are to be interpreted in a manner compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T , and in particular Article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention concerning the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement .
Uruguay guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular by the fact that , within the quantities specified in this agreement , export lic@@ ences are issued for the products referred to as number 1 .
the Community comm@@ its itself to take all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issu@@ ance of import licenses for the aforementioned articles of origin in Uruguay is subject to the submission of an export licence which is designated by the designated authority designated by the Urugu@@ ay@@ an government .
in carrying out provisions , it is also stipul@@ ated that the competent Urugu@@ ay@@ an authority responsible for the responsible authority of the Community in regular intervals reports the quantities to which export lic@@ ences have been issued ; this information may , if necessary , en@@ code to the country of destination .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand , and for the territory of the republic of eastern Uruguay on the other .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that date , it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a deadline of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes they consider necessary .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government with this letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I respect the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay in the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community . &quot; &quot; &quot;

to eliminate the harmful effect of bacterial growth in plasma , blood donations that show signs of bacterial contamination are not used ; the ster@@ ility of every donation must be proven in a quantity of at least 10 ml .
in order to reduce the risk of hepatitis transmission , there are mix@@ tures that do not contain more than 12 donations , or to apply other methods that are known to reduce this danger in a comparable manner .
one of the quantity of liquid used in the production of plasma is to add corresponding water quantity ; the substance must be completely dissolved within 10 minutes at 15 to 20 C .
a given quantum plasma is dissolved in the quantity of water , which corresponds to the amount of liquid produced from which it is produced ; the solution is subjected to the following tests :
2 ) If 1 ml solution requires sufficient amount of thro@@ mb@@ in or calcium chlori@@ de , cl@@ ot@@ ting occurs ; the process can be accelerated in the brood @-@ furnace at 37 ° .
due to the 24 @-@ stage drying process in the presence of phosphor@@ us pent@@ oxi@@ d under a pressure of at most 0.@@ 02 mm mercury , weight loss can not occur at the human dry @-@ plasma loss of 0.5 % .

the label on the container contains all information listed on the corresponding socket ( plant 4 ) .
the normal human immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ulin is a compound made of plasma proteins which was produced from human , antibody @-@ normal adults .
the production method applied must ensure that the final product fu@@ ell@@ ates the conditions described below and does not transmit viral hepatitis .
in addition , the manufacturing method must ensure that the antibodies contained in the output product are sufficiently concentrated in the final product .
the method is satisfactory for each final preparation in this regard , if in the initial and final product antibodies for at least one virus and a bacterial tox@@ in are ti@@ tr@@ ed .
during production , no anti@@ sep@@ tic or bacter@@ i@@ ost@@ atic substance may be added ; to ensure the bacterial ster@@ ility and stability of the final product , a suitable preserv@@ ative and a suitable stabili@@ zer can be added to it .
the final product is supplied as a solution whose immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ulin concentration must be between 100 and 170 g per litre .
II ) The electro@@ ph@@ or@@ esis , represented by free @-@ floating particles under acceptable and suitable conditions , must show that at least 90 % of the protein mass possesses the flexibility of the g@@ amma component of the glob@@ ul@@ ine of the normal human plasma .
the final solution must not have any signs of precip@@ itation or clou@@ d@@ iness before or after a 7 @-@ day heating . furthermore , it is advisable .
perform tests using the centri@@ fu@@ gal method in the ultra@@ centri@@ fu@@ ge to determine in which mass the product deca@@ ys in components with a lower molecular weight .
after di@@ lution , the pH value of the final solution must be a protein concentration of 10 g per litre with a solution containing 0.@@ 15 mo@@ l potassium chlori@@ de per litre , with a measurement temperature of 15 to 25 C 6.@@ 8 ± 0,@@ 4 .

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples containing an@@ tigen , which is hom@@ olo@@ g to the antibody or another on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the recommended way by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution , in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated exclusively for volume of blood cell di@@ lution in the total volume .
for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that should be used on object gir@@ ders , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on a property carrier .
the World Health Organization has established international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity at the time of standards .
according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of International units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the titles observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most specific@@ ities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ary , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te flooding .
the ti@@ ter indicates the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mix within a series , where a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , for which international standard preparations are present ( at present anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the title of the unknown re@@ agent in comparison to the international standard preparation or a state standard preparation in International units ( see Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) .
if you bring it back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ eren according to definition contain 256 International units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the following table shows an example of a comparative title of the International Standard serum Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unknown &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2@@ B . &gt; P@@ IC FIL@@ E = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &gt; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties should remain at least one year long .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in a flu@@ ffy form according to label is at most one year after the final satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date for dry re@@ agents on the label is based on the results of the exp@@ ir@@ ation tests ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are kept in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no moisture can enter .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0,5 BC of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosphor@@ us pent@@ oxi@@ des at a pressure of no more than 0,@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the sol@@ vents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is added an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to fu@@ ell the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein @-@ nitrogen per ml flu@@ ffy or re @-@ dissolved serum .
the re@@ agents , regardless of whether in a flu@@ ffy form or after re @-@ resolution , must be transparent and must not contain any sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents destined for the international exchange for blood group determination should not be colored arti@@ fici@@ ally , at least until an international agreement has come about with a uniform system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent being in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has over all stages of production and checks of re@@ agents for determining blood @-@ group determination in written records .
appropriate specimens of all the agents spent are to be stored for a long time from the laboratory until it is likely that the Char@@ ge is no longer used .
re@@ agents used for blood @-@ group determination can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective proportion , the others are the necessary aid to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are divided into three groups following the origin of their active part .
this does not mean that re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
a black on white printed label in English and French can be attached to each tank containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the quantity or , in dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for re@@ plen@@ ishment ,
furthermore , this label or label on the cardboard box containing the individual containers , or the instructions attached to the containers must contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3. the quantity or , in dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for re@@ plen@@ ishment ,
each consi@@ gn@@ ment shall be enclosed in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention according to the system to this protocol .
anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood of selected individuals of group B , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or by specific substances of group A .
anti @-@ A serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of group A and AB including the sub@@ group A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2@@ B . there are no human red blood cells containing no A an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B .

if anti @-@ B serum is mixed on a property carrier with an equal amount of a 5@@ - to 10 % in@@ und@@ ulation of B @-@ blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination needs to occur within the double time required if the same attempt is carried out with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or with a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um is derived from the blood of selected persons of group 0 , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of group A and group B .
anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain ag@@ glut@@ inus A and / or B , i.e. those of group A including sub@@ groups A1 and A2 of group B and group AB including sub@@ groups A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2@@ B ; it ag@@ glut@@ ates no human red blood cells that do not contain ag@@ glut@@ inus A or B , i.e. those of group 0 .
it ag@@ glut@@ ates human red blood cells containing the A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) an@@ tigen ( which are generally not ag@@ glut@@ inated by anti @-@ A serum of group B blood don@@ ors ) .
an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um is parallel to the again dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the Anti @-@ A blood group serum or equivalent comparative medication , separate against floods of A1 and A2 blood cells .
furthermore , it is parallel to the again dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or a corresponding comparison apparatus to ti@@ tr@@ ate against a coating of B @-@ blood cells .
the effectiveness of the serum may in no case be less than 64 international units per ml .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum also has to produce an easily recognizable ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) blood cells .
if an Anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) is mixed on a property carrier with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10 % in@@ und@@ ations of A1 and A2 blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination needs to occur within the double time required if the same attempts are performed with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or with a standard preparation of the same activity .

if an anti @-@ A + an anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um is mixed on a property carrier with the same amount of a 5@@ - to 10 % di@@ pping of A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) blood cells , ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 ° C .
anti @-@ R@@ h blood group sera each specific@@ ity can belong to one of two types , which differ by the conditions under which an ag@@ glut@@ ination of hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells is reached .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with others , which are described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ completely &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved in the presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as cattle alb@@ um@@ in or by means of other special methods . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; some &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incomplete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; serum ag@@ glut@@ inate on slides also homo@@ gene@@ ously red blood cells , which are em@@ itted in their own serum or plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following requirements for the efficacy of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h group may be changed if international standard preparations are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people who are immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 32 compared to c@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ % sal@@ ine solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D serum is parallel to the newly dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the in@@ complete anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) serum or a corresponding comparison chart vis @-@ à @-@ vis C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , the serum will react by means of blood cells containing do @-@ an@@ tigen .
anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which are intended for the use of slides in accordance with the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination has to be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ C serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people who are immun@@ ised by the ag@@ glut@@ ino@@ gen C of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with flooding of human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C @-@ an@@ tigen .
these serum levels are therefore specific to the C @-@ an@@ tigen only if the tested blood cells are absorbed in a 0.@@ 9@@ % sal@@ ine solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ti@@ ter of the Anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ c@@ d@@ dee @-@ blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test ( and not contain any form of anti @-@ D ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination has to be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ E serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people , which are immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .

sera of the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective at the same time under the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer .
if a serum for use on object carriers is determined according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation period in all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , should not be less than with the ant@@ ei@@ genic antibodies .
anti @-@ A serum is derived from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances of group A .
anti @-@ A serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups A and AB including sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2@@ B ; it ag@@ glut@@ inated not human red blood cells that contain no A an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B .
an anti @-@ A serum is , parallel to the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the Anti @-@ A blood group serum or equivalent comparison , separated with flooding of A1 , A2 and A@@ 2@@ B red blood cells ( 1 ) .
if Anti @-@ A serum is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10 % in@@ und@@ ulation of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2@@ B blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination needs to occur in every coating within the double time required if the same attempt is performed with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ B serum is derived from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of the blood group B .
anti @-@ B serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups B and AB ; it ag@@ glut@@ ates no human red blood cells containing no B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A .
an anti @-@ B serum is , parallel to the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or a corresponding comparison apparatus , with a coating of blood cells in group B ( 1 ) .
if anti @-@ B serum is mixed on a property carrier with an equal amount of a 5@@ - to 10 % in@@ und@@ ulation of B @-@ blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination needs to occur within the double time required if the same attempt is carried out with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or with a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ Human @-@ Glob@@ ulin serum for use in blood group ser@@ ology must include ag@@ glut@@ ination antibodies against Ig@@ G Glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ ination antibodies against complementary factors .
it is extracted from the blood of animals which are immun@@ ised by injection of human serum proteins .
