<seg id="728">Based on the initial report mentioned in Article 62, the organization publishes a summarized appraisal of the entire underlying core material in the States, irrespective of its origins, and carries out this inventory on the basis of the subsequent reports and the results of their investigations.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation (Organisation) on the other.</seg>
<seg id="730">The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is impeded by general resource transfer problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) The aim of the EEC and the Member States is that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound to force the agreement within six months, and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the organization have consulted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the mean bonds to ensure a wide and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">For this purpose, the EEC organization has presented a table that is intentional in which way it intends to apply the criteria set out in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization establishes a special account under the name "Special Account" that consists of the funds which the Member States will contribute to the special transaction account. this account is governed and used by the organization as administrator, only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction account is managed separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) The payment shall be made in the form of cash or intrinsic bonds issued by the member state, which are payable upon request in the currency of the relevant state to order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited in the organisation in the country concerned.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) The payment shall be made in two installments (i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the contract within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the Administrator appointed time;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to the 1 January 1979 or at another time, which has been agreed between the EEC and the administrator, taking into account the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Any Member State may wish to pay the payments before the dates mentioned above.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to the usual procedures of the organization, the administrator takes about proportionate drawing on the cash or the school jacks to cover the expenses for the special transaction and to balance the special transaction account appropriately.</seg>
<seg id="741">In case of granting such loans, the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the EEC conditions:</seg>
<seg id="742">(III) the extent in which international economic factors contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">VI) the composition and tendency of the country's debt service and its further credit capacity to loan terms without disagreement; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) the extent in which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Every transaction loan is used to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly outsourced development program or project (including a sectoral proposal), which is assessed, approved and managed by the organization financed by ordinary means of the organization, and the objective of the addition to this agreement is to be taken into account in this agreement (b).</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the promotional code may not be used instead of ordinary funds from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the organization, which has been approved within the framework of a loan or credit for a program or plan approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from Section 4, special transaction loans are subject to the same repayment conditions, which are generally applicable to the organisation granted by the organization; they are thus repayable in 10 years each in 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="748">Transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are repayable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts for payment of this watch are to be paid directly to the organization that it retains.</seg>
<seg id="750">Any special transaction loan can be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in which the origin of the funds is stated.</seg>
<seg id="751">The proceeds from any special transaction can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services manufactured or produced (i) in a Member State; ii) in developing countries, which are members of the organization and which according to what the administrator decided at the time of the loan granted, could be the recipient of a promotional loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments of special transactions are transferred to the special transaction account, and the amount paid back in this way in the currency of a member state shall be remitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned.</seg>
<seg id="753">Until the full disclosure of all special transactions, the Administrator obliges the EEC to pass on the plans and programs approved by the directors for the examination by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the period of the withdrawal of the special transaction loan, the administrator of the EEC teaches quarterly about the development of the special transaction loan and the expenditure for that purpose.</seg>
<seg id="755">As soon as possible, the Administrator imparts the EEC as soon as possible after the completion of the financial year of the organization a detailed billing of the transaction account with an opinion of the external auditor of the organization to this account closure.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the promotional loan, the administrator of the EEC will send a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and conducts appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account, which are issued from the account receipts to the account paid and paid out from the account, and the repayments to the Member States are evident.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the caretakers work closely to achieve the objectives of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">For this purpose, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the Administrator up to the full issue of the means of the special transaction account from time to time lead to an exchange of ideas on the status of the special transaction account, the progress of programmes or projects that are funded by the action, and on any other questions related to the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement entered into force on 31 December 1978, or at a later date, which the EEC and the organization were able to agree upon, the agreement and all the obligations resulting from it shall become invalid with immediate effect.</seg>
