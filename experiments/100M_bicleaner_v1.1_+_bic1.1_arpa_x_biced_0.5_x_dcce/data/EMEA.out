it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg of melt tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ l thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental disorder where the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of anor@@ ex@@ ia ) alternate with periods of normal mood .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe severe episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the drug in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances when the oral consumption of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used to inhal@@ e or melt tablets in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who take other medicines at the same time , which are degra@@ ded as well as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose should be adjusted by Abi@@ li@@ fy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this interfer@@ es with the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably works primarily as a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to lesser extent than the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate recept@@ ors .
as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its recur@@ rence .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent the recur@@ rence of the symptoms was studied in three trials for up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that suffered from increased anxiety over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence , to 160 patients in whom the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy Inj@@ ection Solution was compared in a study involving 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from increased anxiety with which from Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medicine ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients was investigated using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the enam@@ el tablets and the solution to take in .
in the two studies with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg were significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients receiving a placebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo .
in addition to 74 weeks Abi@@ li@@ fy also prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased anxiety and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ am@@ idal dis@@ ruption , diar@@ rho@@ ea , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , nausea and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to heavy man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes continued to prevail against the risks .
in addition , the committee concluded that the benefits of injection solution in fast control of increased anxiety and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceu@@ tical Europe Ltd . , a permit for the incor@@ poration of Abi@@ li@@ fy across the European Union .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day each day regardless of meals .
an increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the recommended dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after menop@@ aus@@ al therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines ) or hypertension ( including active and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment .
if the symptoms and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , should be taken into consideration , reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ ns , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be dismissed .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis who are associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dos@@ ages , a significant relationship between dosage and response for un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy .
there are no accurate risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents treated patients who permit direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ uria , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to worsen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advised if Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically un@@ relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy subjects , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ isers can result in common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabol@@ isers .
considering the joint administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
after setting up the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be lifted to the dose height prior to the start of the companion therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em ( or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered together with Abi@@ li@@ fy , with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ amorph@@ ous / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine @-@ ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ Pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ amorph@@ ous ) .
patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
this drug may not be used in pregnancy because of the lack of data on humans and due to the concerns generated in reproductive studies in animal studies , unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study of over 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ alie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared with patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients was placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients with regard to ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study of more than 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those with lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo @-@ treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters were detected , did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
side effects related to anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l , include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intended or un@@ inten@@ tional acute over@@ dos@@ ages with ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
there is no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dosage , as Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l has a high plas@@ map@@ rot@@ ein band@@ aging .
it is thought that the efficacy of ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder over the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine dop@@ amine and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and to the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
in doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks of healthy subjects , posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in binding of 11@@ C @-@ rac@@ co@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , on the cau@@ dat@@ us and the put@@ ty .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study 52 the share of respon@@ der patients , which kept a response to the study medication , was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from the measurement scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression scale , showed a significantly greater improvement than in hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher return rate , 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % under placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled multi @-@ blind study of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials with flexible dose over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l showed a versus placebo @-@ superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
in two placebo and actively controlled mon@@ otherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l showed a efficacy in week 3 versus placebo , comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
also in week 12 Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia like lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which in some cases did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabil@@ isation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar reg@@ ression , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l , the N @-@ de@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination rate is approximately 75 hours for ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l in extensive metabol@@ isation via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; poor &apos; ( = poor poor ) metabol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a simulation @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not indicate clin@@ ically significant differences in respect to eth@@ ni@@ city or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of liver function to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with h@@ ep@@ atic cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional research on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gene ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogenic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not identify any particular dangers for humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al rin@@ se toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al rin@@ ady carcin@@ omas / carcin@@ omas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10@@ x of average Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
moreover , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations found in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l found no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys , and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed following dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 @-@ fold of the central Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in order to prevent the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the therapy should be continued with the same dose .

dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em ( or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered together with Abi@@ li@@ fy , with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is thought that the efficacy of ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder over the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine dop@@ amine and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled multi @-@ blind study of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics were compared to 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 besides , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed following dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 @-@ fold of the central Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
Abi@@ li@@ fy Inj@@ ection Solution is used to quickly control ag@@ gregation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be terminated and commen@@ ced with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l .
in order to increase the resor@@ ption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by circum@@ v@@ enting adi@@ pose regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute treatment ( see section 4.5 ) .
if an additional oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l is indicated , see the summary of the features of the drug to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy Mel@@ ting tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution .
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were different from schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ole injection solution is deemed necessary , patients should be observed in terms of extreme se@@ dation or a blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) .
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines ) or hypertension ( including active and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment .
clinical manifestations of a m@@ ns are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing consciousness layers and signs of autonomous instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ uria , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to a worsen@@ ing of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ dation was larger compared to the after all@@ some administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study where healthy volunteers ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dosage ) was used in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly in the healthy subjects and the simultaneously lau@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) were in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically un@@ relevant .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ isers can result in a common application with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and H@@ IV@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
after setting up the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be lifted to the dose height prior to the start of the companion therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular received , the intensity of the se@@ dation was larger compared to that after all@@ some administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .

the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients was placebo .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % was reported in patients with regard to ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those with lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients with ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo @-@ treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters were detected , did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
side effects related to anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l , include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant significant improvement of ag@@ gi@@ dity / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders associated with placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ gi@@ dity and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances , the Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms of as@@ gi@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ b@@ ance compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed mean improvement of the bas@@ eline on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour final point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe a@@ stringent , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the total population , but a statistical significance could be determined due to a reduced patient number .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study 52 the share of respon@@ der patients , which kept a response to the study medication , was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ Depres@@ sions@@ rates scale , showed a significantly greater improvement than hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher return rate , 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % under placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled multi @-@ blind study of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
111 in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which in some cases did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study conducted over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabil@@ isation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar reg@@ ression , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
the Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection 90 % larger the AU@@ C according to the dose of the same dose as tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers the mean time was applied to the maximum plasma level in 1 to 3 hours after application .
the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated use in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15 - or 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ related concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure to 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) were beyond the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gene ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogenic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not identify any particular dangers for humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans ; therefore , they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al rin@@ se toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ gia cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al rin@@ ds in females with 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
moreover , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 81 @-@ times the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed following dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 @-@ times of the average steady @-@ state AU@@ C at recommended clinical toler@@ ances .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters previously had received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medi@@ an containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side @-@ effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane were treated to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
if one considers only patients treated for metastatic breast cancer for the first time , there was no difference between the efficacy indicators such as time to the deterioration of the disease and survival .
in contrast , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
it may also not be used in patients who breast@@ feed or before the treatment have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was active in patients with whom the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel and that it does not have to be given with other medicines in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ axel medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited licence for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with the absence of first @-@ line metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine therapy is not shown ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ora of &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 , treatment should be interrupted until an improvement is achieved in degrees 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adap@@ tations in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function have been conducted and there is currently no sufficient data on the recommendation of dose adap@@ tations in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to inadequate data on safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ axel , which could have substantially other pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptom@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ axel again .
in patients no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be introduced until the neut@@ ro@@ phy@@ te is again increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number is again increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abrasion .
while a clearly associated Cardi@@ ac toxic@@ ity has not been proven with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if there are nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in patients after the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , which do not have effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is unavoid@@ able .
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to not bear a child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised before treatment via a sperm conservation , since the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect the ability to transport and the ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and major incidents of side effects that occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most prominent hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly re@@ versi@@ bly and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
listed below are the side effects associated with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1.000 ) ; very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasional : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased liqu@@ or hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosphor@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :

rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite related case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual incidence are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events has been established .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an an@@ tim@@ icro@@ bial agent that promotes the pooling of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in @-@ vitro studies has been demonstrated that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of alb@@ um@@ in through the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ umin@@ re@@ ep@@ tor and occurs due to the alb@@ um@@ in @-@ binding protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation in the area of the tumour .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two un@@ verb@@ alized untreated studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III trial .
in one study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was administered in the form of an in@@ fusion for over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this mul@@ tic@@ entr@@ e study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who received treatment with pac@@ lit@@ axel every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication for the prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a impaired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % only had adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asis and 19 % because of metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First @-@ line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for decay on bas@@ eline because of the cum@@ ulative Tox@@ ic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute injection of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies .
the active substance exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml , analog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After the intraven@@ ous dose of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase manner .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 , the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vas@@ cul@@ arly distribution and / or soft tissue binding of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study involving patients with advanced solid tumours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel after intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute injection of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane were compared with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel .
the clear@@ ance of pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration ( 43 % ) than after a solvent @-@ based pac@@ lit@@ axel injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers is reported that pac@@ lit@@ axel is met@@ aboli@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ic@@ lit@@ axel and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ic@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
after a 30 minutes in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative urine ex@@ cre@@ tion of the unchanged active ingredient was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ic@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , suggest@@ ing a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearing .
however , only a few data are available about patients at the age of more than 75 years , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original cardboard and in light of light protected over 8 hours .

using a sterile injection is inj@@ ected slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution into a Abra@@ x@@ ane penetration bottle .
after the solution has been completed , the spray bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid .
then the spray bottle should be swi@@ v@@ elled slowly and carefully and / or inver@@ ted for at least 2 minutes until a complete res@@ us@@ pension of the powder is carried out .
if precip@@ itation or sin@@ uses are visible , the hot water bottle must be inver@@ ted gently , in order to achieve a complete res@@ us@@ pension before the application .

Abra@@ x@@ ane is used to treat breast cancer when other therapies have been tried , but not successful , and if you are not eligible for anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine therapies .
Abra@@ x@@ ane may not be used : • If you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Pac@@ lit@@ axel or any of the other Abra@@ x@@ ane components , if you are breast@@ feeding • if your white blood cells are low ( starting values for neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils of &lt; 1.5 x 109 / l - your doctor will inform you about it )
special caution when using Abra@@ x@@ ane is required : • If you have a dist@@ ressed kidney function , if you suffer num@@ b@@ ness , ting@@ ling , ting@@ ling sensation , touch sensitivity or muscle weakness • if you suffer from severe liver problems • if you have heart problems
if you use Abra@@ x@@ ane with other medicines , please inform the doctor if you use other medicines or have recently used it , even if it is not prescription medication , as this might cause an interaction with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
in addition , they should be advised against the treatment of a sperm conservation , because the Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment is the possibility of lasting in@@ fertility .
the use of machines Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) , which can affect the efficiency and ability to operate machinery .
if you receive other medicines as part of your treatment , you should consult your doctor regarding driving or serving .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; member states must ensure that the holder of the authorisation for placing on the market will provide the medical personnel in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmac@@ ies with the following information and materials : &quot; &quot; &quot;
• Training brochure • summary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packing samples . • With a clear picture of the correct application of the product , refriger@@ ated boxes for transport through the patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference drug &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood vessels where blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur if a blood loss is not possible before the intervention and a loss of blood from 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml is expected .
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed has to be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and patients who want to make an own blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection can also be done by the patient or his supervis@@ or , provided that they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in recommended areas ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to be monitored before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients who receive chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by an@@ thropo@@ i@@ esis or by the fact that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s own ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to enable it to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with an injection into a V@@ ene as part of a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from an@@ emia caused by kidney problems .
to all patients participating in this study , E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had been inj@@ ected into a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either switched to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
the company also presented the results of a study where the effects of the skin spra@@ yed under the skin were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients suffering from an@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained to the same degree as those who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the starting value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common adverse event of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this will not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the European Union regulations , evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that produces Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for the medical staff in all member states , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission issued approval to the company Medi@@ c Pharmaceu@@ tical P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG as a permit for abor@@ tion in the whole European Union .

treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in case of planned larger surgical procedures , which require a large blood volume rate ( 4 or more units blood in men ) .
to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery in adults with no iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ atric patients , in which the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor .
a rise in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels can be observed on or under the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration in one patient .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in instability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permitted dosage , which is required for control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
the results of this study suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the results of this study suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by means of intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ a@@ emia and follow @-@ up may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in instability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permitted dosage , which is required for control of an@@ a@@ emia symptoms .
if after 4 weeks of treatment of the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the target number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to bas@@ eline , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in increased &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the target number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to bas@@ eline , the dose should be lifted to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ od number by ≥ 1 g / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .
on the other hand , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) respectively the target number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the starting value , an approach to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be abor@@ ted .
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood c@@ anned foods is required , Ab@@ se@@ amed should be received twice a week prior to the surgical procedure in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight .
with the iron substitution you should start as soon as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - to make large iron reserves available before the beginning of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgical procedure and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given 300 I.@@ U. / kg pre@@ oper@@ atively on 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately thereafter .
alternatively , the injection at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis can be given over the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure a sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation .
patients who are ill with any ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tin on ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive a Ab@@ se@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ sti@@ en@@ ia ) .
heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ ils ) .
the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients who are unable to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program : severe coron@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial occ@@ lu@@ sion , vascular disease of the carcin@@ oma or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with a recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely was reported about the occurrence of a PR@@ CA medi@@ cally transmitted after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden effect loss , defined as a reduction in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes of failure ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ um@@ intoxic@@ ation , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are investigated .
when the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ yte &quot; index &quot; ) , is lower ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone @-@ marks should be considered for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA .
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity for sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of anti @-@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ a@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration in Section 4.2 .
in clinical studies an increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ esis stimul@@ ant agents ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit to the ability of epo@@ et@@ ines if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased by means of the concentration required for controlling an@@ emia symptoms and avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase should amount to about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evi@@ d@@ ent coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in section 4.2 .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia associated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in case of tumour patients under chemotherapy , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa has to be considered a 2 @-@ 3 week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response ( patients that may need to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase is higher than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ic an@@ emia - dose adjustment with the aim of holding the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in level between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thropo@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the patient &apos;s involvement , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , before the beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ a@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly .
patients who undergo a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive adequate thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be excluded that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl is an increased risk of post @-@ operative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic / vascular occ@@ lu@@ sion .
in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ emia or decrease the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in people with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy was led back if a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ port dose can be adjusted to the rising hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in vitro studies on tumor tissues there is no evidence of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients suffering from epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension .
an increased incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients under treatment with ery@@ thropo@@ ds .
regardless of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications .
the techn@@ ologically acquired epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ fied and is identical to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content identical to endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ emia patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thropo@@ genesis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ sts ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ dg@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ oma and 24 other ha@@ em@@ bla@@ sts ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 17@@ 2 breast cancer , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , and 30 more ) .
1895 patients with solid tumours ( 6@@ 83 breast cancer , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , 17@@ 4 gy@@ nec@@ ological tum@@ ors , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ sts .
survival and tumour progression were studied in five major controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed a consistent , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality rate than the controls associated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and with controls .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ism in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the verified data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa regulations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than serum levels achieved after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last application .
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study on hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
14 . in animal experiments with approximately 20 times the recommended daily dose recommended at humans , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa has led to a dimin@@ ished f@@ ec@@ tal body weight , a delay in the occ@@ lu@@ sion and an increase in fo@@ etus mortality .

during treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed it can lead to a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets within the normal range , which is reflected in further treatment .
your doctor may periodi@@ cally carry out regular blood tests to check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets on a regular basis during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , the dissolution of the red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated with Ab@@ se@@ amed prior to the start of treatment .

if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ sti@@ p@@ ia , it will break off your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value could be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of elevated or increasing levels of potassium , your doctor can take into account an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , until the potassium levels are again in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney weakness and clin@@ ically obvious coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion by inadequate heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in level does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of blood vessels with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ob@@ lation and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the efficacy of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ se@@ amed dose accordingly to minimize the risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic event ) .
this risk should be weighed very carefully by the advantages derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular occ@@ lu@@ sion , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( e.g. deep ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ lia ) .
if you are a cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed is like a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances can adver@@ sely affect the tumour .
if a larger or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic operation is imminent , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly before the beginning of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed .
if your values of red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have been taken / used recently , even if it is not prescription medicine .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may be able to arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory investigations have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means to set up the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your blood vessels ( an@@ a@@ emia ) respond to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment success and make sure that the medicine works properly and your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , distributed to two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and to ensure that your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia responds to treatment , the dose may be adjusted every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to make sure that the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will conduct regular blood tests .
if necessary to shor@@ ten treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of the operation and another 4 days after surgery .

A@@ cla@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause as well as in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including those who recently suffered from a low trau@@ matic frac@@ ture like with H@@ inf@@ allen ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 12@@ ,000 IE ) prior to the first in@@ fusion or administered by injection into a muscle .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days following in@@ fusion such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
for the treatment of the Mur@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active ingredient in A@@ cla@@ v is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cla@@ sta .
the first study included nearly 8@@ ,000 older women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of verteb@@ ral and hip frac@@ tures was investigated over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently had a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta was tested in two studies of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator for efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) norm@@ alized in the blood or decreased at least 75 % compared to bas@@ eline .
in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis sur@@ geri@@ es ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the patients .
the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % in comparison to all patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis sur@@ geri@@ es ) .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under A@@ cla@@ y@@ had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients taking placebo ( 139 from 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most A@@ cla@@ ys side effects occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less common in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
it may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any other ingredient .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with A@@ cla@@ v are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ on@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of A@@ cla@@ sta provides educational material for physicians who prescri@@ be A@@ cla@@ sta to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains instructions on how to use the medicine , as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a licence for the issu@@ ance of A@@ cla@@ sta throughout the European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic frac@@ ture frac@@ ture .
the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The package insert • contra@@ indication in pregnancy and lac@@ t@@ ating women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , the non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • Can be resor@@ ted to medical or nursing assistance
oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic frac@@ ture frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic frac@@ ture correction , the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ v is recommended two or more weeks after surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for treatment of the Mur@@ bus Pa@@ get A@@ cla@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Pa@@ get with A@@ cla@@ sta , a long re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , corresponding twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first A@@ cla@@ ve in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta .
patients with ren@@ al impair@@ ment ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents A@@ cla@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age since data on harm@@ lessness and efficacy is lacking .
A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , since only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before starting treatment ( see Section 4.3 ) .
because of the rapid onset of the effect of ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , corresponding twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( bad oral hygiene ) should be examined prior to using bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
for patients who require dental surgery , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation reported as severe adverse events was increased ( 1,3 % ) ( 51 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to those receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation between A@@ cla@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) adverse drug interactions are listed in Table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic was associated with ren@@ al dys@@ functions which referred to as a decrease in ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the changes in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing ( measured annually before the administration ) and the incidence of kidney failure and limited kidney function were comparable in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the an@@ cla@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum @-@ cre@@ atine within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ y@@ xis versus 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the assessment of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , occurred at 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in the Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures following a frac@@ ture frac@@ ture and in the Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures following a recently filed hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions to the in@@ fusion site such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area was know@@ ingly , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( primary in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental surgery .
7 study involving 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients performed oste@@ on@@ ec@@ on@@ sis in the jaw area of one with A@@ cla@@ sta and placebo @-@ treated patients .
in case of over@@ dose which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation can be achieved by giving oral calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cla@@ y@@ 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric spinal frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta decreased significantly over a period of three years and already after a year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
patients from 75 years of age and older had a risk of reduced risk for verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta had an equally lasting effect over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cla@@ sta increased bone density on lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra , hip and dist@@ al radius compared with placebo treatment significantly at all time points ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the whole hip at 6.@@ 0 % , the th@@ igh@@ s by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology in 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es from the reservoir .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in trab@@ ecular bone volume compared to placebo and received trab@@ ecular bone architecture .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pep@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in the serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the study duration .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose A@@ cla@@ sta reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly reduced by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below the starting value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the starting value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the starting value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks prior to in@@ fusion .
total mortality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the treated group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment increased the BM@@ D at all points of time compared to placebo treatment .
the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment conducted more than 24 months in comparison with placebo treatment to increase the BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % in total fragran@@ ces and 4.3 % at the th@@ ig@@ h neck .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo @-@ treated men .
in another study in men ( Study C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of A@@ cla@@ ys was not inferior compared to the weekly administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in relation to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline .
clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cla@@ sta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically verified , especially mild to moderate severe Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase corresponding to the 2,@@ 6@@ times to 3,@@ 0@@ x age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate compared to the intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months was demonstrated in two six @-@ month comparison studies .
the combined results showed a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence compared to bas@@ eline and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate compared to bas@@ eline .
patients who were classified as respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month study could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 with A@@ cla@@ sta and the 107 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response was observed in 141 of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , compared to 71 of those treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , in the mean time of follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid in 64 patients resulted in the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
after that , the plasma level quickly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bio@@ phase disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early part phases ( α and β , with the t ½ -@@ values mentioned above ) presumably represent the rapid resor@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total body @-@ Clear@@ ance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion @-@ time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the zone acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the area below the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a reduced clear@@ ances of met@@ aboli@@ zed substances which are met@@ aboli@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ enzyme systems is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ aboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or even no direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , hydrogen @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearing of the ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ atine clearing , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 examined patients ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al impair@@ ment down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing up to 35 ml / min requiring no dose adjustment of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid .
since severe ren@@ al dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- clear@@ ances &lt; 30 ml / min ) are only limited data , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ let@@ ally active intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and at rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
in studies on dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of recommended human therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without ren@@ al influence .
sub@@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , ren@@ al toler@@ ability of ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was given in rats by dos@@ ages of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose corresponding to the 7@@ fold of human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in accumulated ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects were present in other organs , including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , and intraven@@ ous injection .
the most common complic@@ ation in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the metap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with nearly all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats observed ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in doses from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg due to low serum calcium levels .

July 2007 , amended on 29 September 2006 , the pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application is effective and works before and during the product is marketed .
risk management plan The owner of the marketing authorization shall undertake the studies and additional activities for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance , which are present in the pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance plan of the approved version 00@@ 4 of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2 of the authorisation application and all subsequent versions of the R@@ MP approved by the CH@@ MP .
according to the CH@@ MP gui@@ deline for risk management systems for human medicine , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
an over@@ hau@@ led R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could affect the current statements on safety , the drug vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • At half 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) was reached . • On request of E@@ MEA .
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid is a class of substances called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Pa@@ get of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens formed by and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone reconstruction takes place too quickly , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
A@@ cla@@ sta works by re @-@ norm@@ alizing the bone structure , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and once again gives strength to the bone .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cla@@ sta .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have been taken / applied recently , even if it is not prescription medicine .
for your doctor , it is especially important to know if you are taking medicines that are known to damage the kidneys .
when using A@@ cla@@ sta along with food and drink , be sure to take sufficient liquid before and after the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion to a vein .
if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to admini@@ ster A@@ cla@@ v two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion to a vein .
as A@@ cla@@ sta works for a long time , you may need to take another dose only after a year or more .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium mirror in your blood is not too low in the time after in@@ fusion .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get A@@ cla@@ sta can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if you miss A@@ cla@@ sta , you will immediately contact your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment .
before the end of the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta If you consider the termination of the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion are very common ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but less frequent after subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta .
currently it is unclear whether A@@ cla@@ v causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you have experienced such symptoms after you have received A@@ cla@@ sta .

persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or ja@@ ws were reported mainly in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates for other diseases .
about allergic reactions , including rare cases of breathing problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects not listed in this use information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until the application ; normally 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic frac@@ ture suggest that the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ v two or more weeks after surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture is recommended .
before and after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta , patients need to be adequately supplied with fluids ; this is especially important for patients who receive a di@@ ure@@ tic treatment .
due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atically perpet@@ ual , hypo@@ kal@@ emia usually develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , corresponding to at least twice a day 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended prior to the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta .
if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
A@@ comp@@ lia is also applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , including body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or over , respectively , which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or over ) , plus one or more
in addition , four studies were conducted at over 7 000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive agent for setting smoking in comparison to placebo .
on the other hand , the studies on the setting of smoking did not show uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this field of application .
which risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia that were detected during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nausea and infections of the upper respiratory tract .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or be treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts among others in a small minority of patients .
caution is advised at the same time using A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicine against fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for use in H@@ IV@@ - infection ) , t@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Health Evaluation Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . it can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ etic medication ) is not indicated .
it can also be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which cannot be adequately adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest acceptable dose .
in combination with sul@@ fon@@ y@@ res@@ ins or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ fon@@ y@@ res@@ ine or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the acet@@ one treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins or insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks , which makes type 2 diabetes better .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy was examined ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ phon@@ yl alcohol , in addition they received up to 3.5 years either Ac@@ tos or placebo .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which indicates that the blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg doses .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional dose of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with Met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ phon@@ yl alcohol was 0.@@ 94 % in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c , while the additional dose of placebo was 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study investigating the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 28@@ 9 patients , patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin showed a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving placebo .
the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ th@@ esi@@ osis ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients with met@@ form@@ in .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for the placing of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , v@@ aul@@ ted and wear on one side the markings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is in@@ adequately adjusted with insulin and where met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
for the application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are at least risk @-@ prone due to the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. coron@@ ary heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or o@@ ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ ede@@ ma when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular out@@ come study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in reports of cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency , which , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver enzyme levels ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T levels are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme levels are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that point to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , upper stomach upset , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme levels are to be checked .
the decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is continued should be guided by clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters are pre@@ valent .
in clinical studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been demonstrated that may touch fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , corneal ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under therapy with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in similar controlled trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral two or three @-@ fold combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ res@@ e or dual combination therapy with insulin are the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch , it was reported that thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , were reported , or deterioration of di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a decrease in visual acuity .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the presence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescri@@ bing doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report about disturbances of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ologic examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures of random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in the women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in women who were treated with a comparison medication .
in the Pro@@ Active trial , a study of over 3.5 years of study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient @-@ years ) , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient desires a pregnancy or that occurs , the treatment is dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies on the interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or drug dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 @-@ fold .
simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in the AU@@ C of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that in the treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insulin an@@ a@@ emia resulting in pregnancy decreases and increases the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; rare cases : unknown ( not invaluable ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic drugs .
in clinical studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ents above the three @-@ fold upper limit of the normal range were often compared to placebo , but less often than in comparison groups under Met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ y@@ har@@ n@@ stoff .
in an outcome study in patients with advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the incidence of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency was 1.6 % higher than placebo if pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo .
since the market launch , in@@ suffici@@ ency was rarely reported under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , but more frequently if pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summ@@ ari@@ zing analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures of random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with compar@@ ators .
in the Pro@@ Active trial running over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparison medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred .
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one appears to have an activation of specific atomic recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator @-@ activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces glu@@ cos@@ ity production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide as a mon@@ otherapy has been continued for over two years to investigate the time for the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time of two years after the start of the therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one at 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate despite three months of optimisation with insulin , were random@@ ised to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction of insulin dose in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical studies over a year showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ent in comparison with the bas@@ eline values .
the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week examination of type 2 di@@ abe@@ tics .
in most clinical studies , compared to placebo , a reduction in overall plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel and a slight , however clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel observed .
in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced overall plasma gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ la@@ dium and increased HD@@ L cholesterol .
compared to placebo , there was no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol in pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas values decreased under met@@ form@@ in and g@@ lic@@ la@@ dium .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one did not only reduce the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , but also improved the postoperative tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , both over an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride ad@@ sorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active trial , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ised in groups who received either pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is quickly resor@@ bed , with the peak concentrations of un@@ modified pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma usually 2 hours after application .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
in interaction studies , it could be proven that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or drug dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral use of radio@@ actively labeled pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in f@@ ences ( 55 % ) and a lesser extent in urine ( 45 % ) .
mean plasma elimination time of un@@ modified pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the total active metabol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral Clear@@ ance of the mother &apos;s substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys , plasma volume enlar@@ ging with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and rever@@ sible exc@@ entri@@ c heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys .
this is due to the fact that in treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia resulting in the gest@@ ation dimin@@ ishes and increased insulin resistance of the mat@@ ernal animal and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder was induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ons led to an increased frequency of color@@ ectal tumours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry the mark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on one side and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in the women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in women who were treated with a comparison medication .
in the Pro@@ Active trial , a study of over 3.5 years of study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient @-@ years ) , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication .
in another study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were studied with either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide .
in clinical studies over one year showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ent in comparison with the bas@@ eline values .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one did not only reduce the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels but also improved the postoperative tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , which has an effect on Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study missed the target of its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of overall mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , coron@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and re@@ ar@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that with the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one there are no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry the markings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 45 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on one side and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures of random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients receiving comparative medication showed an increased incidence of frac@@ tures in women .

Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane was examined for 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as can not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , after 12 weeks , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror which indicated that the blood sugar levels were similar to a different human@@ oid .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the complete list is the package insert ) .
the CH@@ MP Committee concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane out@@ weigh the risks associated with diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the whole European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice daily if a rapid initial effect along with a longer lasting effect is desired .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood glucose level has improved significantly , for example , by intensified insulin therapy , can perceive hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding starch , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA compared to insulin in animal origin ) can lead to a change in the dosage required .
if a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients who showed hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after switching from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from previous insulin .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor since such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the physician must therefore take into account possible interactions in the therapy and consult his patients according to other medicines taken by them .
4 B@@ oth hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia which can occur in a non @-@ controlled diabetes treatment increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and am@@ ni@@ otic fluid in uter@@ o .

diseases of the nervous system gels - Periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement in blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are called acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually rever@@ sible .
5 A intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with ab@@ rupt improvement in blood sugar setting may be associated with a temporary worsen@@ ing of di@@ ab@@ etic retin@@ opathy .
diseases of the skin and sub@@ cut@@ aneous tissue gel - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy At the injection point , a li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy may arise when failed to change the inser@@ ting points within the injection area .
general diseases and complaints at the administration site - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions to the injection centre Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma at the injection point ) occur .

hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can , however , develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can be treated by the oral supply of glucose and sug@@ ary foods .
di@@ abe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar@@ s , sweets , biscuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a one @-@ weigh@@ ted hel@@ per or by glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration is up to 24 hours .
resor@@ ption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resor@@ ption .
a number of split ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) locations on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
based on conventional research on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gene ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data will not reveal any particular dangers to humans .

follow these steps to avoid the injection of air and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane 10 Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle up • Klo@@ p a few times with your finger against the cartridge .
if air bubbles are present , these will collect the cartridge at the top of the cartridge - while holding Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane 10 Nov@@ o@@ let continue to hold the injection needle upwards , press the button in the direction of the arrow ( Fig@@ ure D ) • Buy now from the tip of the injection needle a drop of insulin .

if the push button is not able to move freely , insulin is pushed out of the injection needle • The scale on the closing lid shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .
the push button moves out@@ wards while you rotate the closing cap • The dial under the push button shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
check the number on the closing cap directly next to the dosing mark • Note the highest number you can see on the pressure button • add the two numbers to get the set dose . if you have set a wrong dose , simply turn the cap forward or backwards until you have set the correct number of units .
otherwise , insulin inj@@ ected from the injection needle and the recommended dose will not be correct • If you have mistakenly tried to set a dose of more than 78 units , follow the steps below :
then remove the closing cap and set it up again , so that the 0 of the dosage brand is opposite .
make sure to press only during the injection to press the button . • Hold the pressure button after the injection , until the injection needle has been pulled out of the skin .
if not , turn the cap until the push button is pressed and then proceed as described before use • Can you hear a cli@@ ck@@ ling noise when pressing the push button .
it may not be accurate , you can &apos;t set a dose higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge - you can use the residual volume scale to estimate how much insulin is left .

this document is a summary of the European Public Employment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
the bacter@@ ici@@ ally effective ingredient in Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , insulin @-@ human ( r@@ DNA ) , is produced using the method of the so @-@ called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant technology . &quot;

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin in human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
moreover , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the incor@@ poration of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id across the European Union .

3 If a dose adjustment is necessary when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor since such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .

aden@@ omas are applied to patients who are already showing signs of cryst@@ alli@@ zation , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or arthritis no@@ des ( &quot; stones &quot; that is to lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter for two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , g@@ out attacks can still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients with aden@@ omas still take other medicines to prevent g@@ out attacks during the first six months .
the medicine is not recommended for children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ tation as it was not investigated for these groups .
in the first study , on which 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with placebo ( placebo ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients whose urine levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients took aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of 80 mg once a day , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who received 120 mg once a day in the last three measurements in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of patients with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
in particular in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Human Medic@@ inal Committee ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic could be more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia associated with diseases that have already led to urine deposits ( including one of the medical history known or currently present and / or arthritis ) .
if the ser@@ um@@ res@@ ic acid level still amounts to &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x can be taken into consideration every day .
in patients with severe ren@@ al impair@@ ment , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents Since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group .
tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients Since there are no experiences in organ tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients , the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , the treatment with f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other res@@ inous drugs , it may result in acute toxic@@ ity during the course of the treatment , because by lowering the serum levels of the serum , ur@@ ic acid deposits can be mobil@@ ised in the tissue .
B . for malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that it comes to a de@@ position in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing Phase 3 clinical studies , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function were observed in patients treated with f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before starting F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ase ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ was no interaction studies conducted at F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition could lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ ary mirror ( a hibition of the metabol@@ isation of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects , the simultaneous administration of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical studies , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dose adjustment for f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient .
in a study involving volunteers 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily measured an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous consumption of an ant@@ acid , containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , retar@@ ded the intake of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decrease in the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies do not include side effects of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be war@@ y of controlling a vehicle , operating machines or exercising dangerous activities until they can be reasonably sure that AD@@ EN@@ OR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .

the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ eral disease and / or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure in the medical history .
common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) side effects that could occur in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once , are listed below .
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical studies no severe skin ras@@ hes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients for up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events reported during long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the indications occasionally .

clinical trial results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month specific serum levels of serum levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were .
Plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a serum cre@@ atine content at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses of al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the conventional dose of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg twice a day .
patients with serum levels &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summ@@ arized for the analysis . * p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg
the reduction in serum levels of &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor visit in week 2 and kept lasting over the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum levels &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al impair@@ ment The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with ren@@ al impair@@ ment ( i.e. h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of recur@@ rence of serum levels in subjects , regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disturbances ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum levels ≥ 10 mg / d@@ L 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum @-@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data of the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that a decrease in the incidence of serum levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 needed treatment against a re@@ plen@@ ishment ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not need treatment for a poison ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the spru@@ ce node size , which resulted in a complete disappearance of the no@@ des until month 24 in 54 % of patients .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5,@@ 0 % ) and also in patients who received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) increased doses of 10 mg to 120 mg doses of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at which is larger than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage @-@ reduction in serum @-@ acid concentration , provided this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent st@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ranges from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to about 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .

these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ ine metabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .

the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month specific serum levels of serum levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were .
the data of the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that a decrease in the incidence of serum levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 needed treatment against a re@@ plen@@ ishment ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not need treatment for a poison ) .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones become br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irritation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
as al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower ( 11 % ) compared to those treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data showing that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , ob@@ struction ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia ( swal@@ lowing disorders ) , irrit@@ ated abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated stomach ) as well as acid re@@ occurring .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other ingredients AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used .
it may not be used in case of diseases of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow the following instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cus , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , except for p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ lasty , are only given under special care ( see Section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al erosion , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ k@@ tures , were reported in patients taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially this severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that point to possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out in case of symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing , or retro@@ corneal pain or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn of the medicine and seek medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that point to es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was detected , rare ( after market launch ) ga@@ stri@@ c and du@@ o@@ den@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , were reported ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ o @-@ rose of the jaw , usually associated with tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regi@@ men mainly contains intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there are no data available to indicate whether a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who need a partial surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis of the jaw .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician is decisive for therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to take the tablet in the next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they have noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned at the intended day of the week .
other diseases affecting mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately before starting treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the resor@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other drugs ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not conducted , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken in clinical trials along with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clin@@ ically relevant interactions occurring .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore neither used during pregnancy or breast @-@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects in regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o @-@ nec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports are derived from cancer patients but also reported on oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
nevertheless , the serum cal@@ ci@@ um took up to &lt; 8,0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with a similar incidence .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate following an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the Fra@@ k@@ tur Inter@@ ven@@ tions@@ - Study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .

in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the BM@@ D of the spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to stop ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the whole body was maintained .
fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled studies where al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 m@@ g. daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dra 7.@@ 9 % versus placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .

bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken half an hour before a standardis@@ ed breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day for five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range of 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 . distribution studies on rats have shown that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily distributed in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly disper@@ sed into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ ences .
after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearing of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic clearing exceeded 200 ml / min .
in rats , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate does not ex@@ cre@@ ase the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these transport systems .

characteristics in patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted through the urine .
although no clinical data is available , it is nonetheless expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal tests will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore in patients with reduced kidney function , an increased risk of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in bones can be expected ( see section 4.2 ) .

advent is given to adult patients who have been transplan@@ ted kidney or liver to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
as Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already in use in the EU , the company has presented the results from previous studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study involving 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation were submitted , whereby the application of law with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared .
the main indicator of effectiveness was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ tation was rejected after a treatment duration of one year ( for example , how often a new organ tran@@ spl@@ ant or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , shorter further studies were carried out on 119 patients with kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant and 129 patients with liver tran@@ spl@@ ant and investig@@ ates how Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft is absorbed by the body in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ lid antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other constitu@@ ents may not be applied .
patients and doctors need to be cau@@ tious when others ( especially some herbal ) drugs should be taken concur@@ r@@ ently as the advent dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of tran@@ spl@@ ant patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this may result in gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dose ; provisions of the formulation or regime should be carried out only under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in the tran@@ spl@@ ant ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of a switch to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dose adap@@ tations must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains .
the recommended dosage should be based primarily on clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood level measurements ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ance , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels should be checked before conversion and over two weeks after conversion .
in day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a talent level , was comparable to both in the kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ ance to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ tation phase .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clear@@ ances , an adaptation of the advent dose can take several days before the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative period does not allow oral consumption of drugs , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment intraven@@ ous ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate to produce an in@@ fusion solution ) can be initiated with a dose of ca .
duration of the application For the suppression of the tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dos@@ can recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Advent @-@ therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further dose adjustments may be required later as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after the tran@@ spl@@ ant .
dos@@ can recommendations - liver tran@@ spl@@ ant proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Advent @-@ therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
recommended Dos@@ age - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ant@@ f must be converted a tran@@ spl@@ ant recipient of twice daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules on a once daily intake of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules , so this conversion has to be done in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , in relation to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ ance once a day , the treatment with the oral and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant recommended for proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection must begin .
heart transplan@@ tation In adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ ance , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once a day .
other tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients Ob@@ probably there is no clinical experience with anti@@ spl@@ ant , p@@ ank@@ cre@@ atic and intestinal transplan@@ ted patients , in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in case of p@@ ank@@ re@@ ast @-@ transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and for bow@@ el tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adap@@ tations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function For the maintenance of blood glucose levels in the targeted area , a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver function disturbances .
patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function has no influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum cre@@ atine levels , a calculation of the cre@@ atine levels and a monitoring of the volume of urine ) is recommended .
switching from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ance When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ to to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is recommended ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the valley level in thorou@@ gh@@ bred The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the aid of thorou@@ gh@@ bred @-@ tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ mirror checks .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dor@@ sal during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy .
the blood @-@ level mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ance , Dos@@ is@@ modi@@ ung , Chan@@ ges in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or while applying substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus whole blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ enti@@ f is a medicine with a low clearing , adjustments of the dose may require several days before the Ste@@ ady State has occurred .
the data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the level of seb@@ um in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in thorou@@ gh@@ bred in the first time after liver transplan@@ tation are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance of liver , kidney and heart tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection or other side effects , which may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in under@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dose ; provisions of the formulation or regime should be carried out only under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in the tran@@ spl@@ ant ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the retar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ance .
in addition to proph@@ yla@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection in adult heart tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients and tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients in childhood , no clinical data for the retar@@ ded formulation advoc@@ acy are still available .
due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may be used , or other herbal remedies during a treatment with Adv@@ ance ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is offered , because the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f , a coron@@ ary or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy referred to as cardi@@ omy@@ opathy was observed , which can therefore occur under the law .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are an already existing heart condition , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disturbances , infections , fluid over@@ loading and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of mal@@ ig@@ ner skin les@@ ions due to appropriate clothing or use of a sun protective device with a high protection factor .
if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , cr@@ amps and visual disturbances , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
since advoc@@ acy hard capsules , retar@@ dation , lac@@ tose contain , special caution is required in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and therefore increase or decrease the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels with concur@@ rent application of substances that can alter the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly pronounced interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed that the increase in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
high @-@ dose pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be met@@ aboli@@ zed with medicines that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 whose metabolism im@@ pairs .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ tives so that hormon@@ al ex@@ positions can increase , decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures are particularly cau@@ tious .
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus could potentially reduce the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a low number of studies on tran@@ spl@@ ant patients do not indicate that under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a surveillance of the new@@ born is recommended for possible adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ ali@@ a@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the adverse event profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive drugs is often not determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
following their incidence in descending order ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) .

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases How known to other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is the suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ k@@ otic , proto@@ zo@@ als ) frequently .
cases of ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with advoc@@ acy .
ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant Ne@@ oplas@@ ma including EB@@ V @-@ associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative disorders and skin tumours in combination with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus were reported .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high bonding of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ able .
action mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are likely to be medi@@ ated by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ish protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) that is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cellular nucleus .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent inhibit@@ ing of signal trans@@ duction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes genes .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was consistent in these published studies in the large studies where Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients .
lung transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , mul@@ tic@@ entr@@ e study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was reported about 110 patients who received either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
chronic tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome , was observed less frequently in the first year after the tran@@ spl@@ ant ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after a year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ k et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it was in 2@@ 1,7 % of cases of the origin of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) as the number of patients treated by Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was higher after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the treatment transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Group ( Tre@@ k et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Tran@@ spl@@ ant 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the incidence of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ al syn@@ dro@@ ms in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly lower .
a mul@@ tic@@ entr@@ e study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was performed to 205 patients who underwent pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ tation at the same time , who received Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) after a random@@ ised trial .
the oral initial dose ( by protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0,2 mg / kg / day and was then obtained for the desired talent levels from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric clinical trial with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f as the primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant following intestinal transplan@@ ts showed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low ha@@ em@@ at@@ oc@@ rats and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound group of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplan@@ tation .
this suggests tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ aboli@@ zed prior to ex@@ cre@@ tion , and ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly done through bile .
the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f in cases of stable patients ( twice a day ) in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) in relation to the total daily dose .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dor@@ sal during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the retar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ance .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are an already existing heart condition , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disturbances , infections , fluid over@@ loading and ede@@ ma .
28 confirmed acute rejection was 29.@@ 3 % within the first 24 weeks in the advent group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) 3@@ 2.6 % and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) .

Adv@@ ances is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital heart defect caused by the lack of factor V@@ III ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether Adv@@ ances are used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A are suffering from a factor V@@ III deficiency which causes blood cl@@ ots such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced according to a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to enable it to form the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor V@@ III .
Adv@@ ances is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is manufactured in a different way so that the medicine does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study involving 53 children under six years , the use of the drug for preventing bleeding and surgical procedures was investigated .
in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ances in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ als with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good &quot; was assessed .
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ances ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor V@@ III .
Adv@@ ances may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor V@@ III , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG for the placing of lawyers in the whole European Union .
dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor V@@ III deficiency , on the site and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events the factor V@@ III activity should not fall under the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ U. / dl ) during the corresponding period .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) , until the risk of the patient is over .
during the course of treatment it is recommended to control the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections to be appropriate to determine the factor V@@ III plasma level .
individual patients may differ in their response to factor V@@ III , achieve different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor V@@ III per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor V@@ III plasma is not achieved or if bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to prove an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor V@@ III therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the rate of administration should depend on the patient &apos;s condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of antibodies against factor V@@ III is a known complic@@ ation in treating patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor V@@ III directed Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by means of modified Be@@ thes@@ da as@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor V@@ III , where the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic well @-@ known inhibit@@ or development , re@@ combin@@ ant Factor V@@ III @-@ product was observed on another , the re@@ occurrence of ( low @-@ tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor V@@ III during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s contained in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors to factor V@@ III ( 5 patients ) , which showed a higher risk of the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the total of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor V@@ III @-@ Spi@@ egels was performed post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - Spiegel in the plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials involving A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE on 145 children and adults 2 with cases of severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ V@@ III ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentrate ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient after 26 Ex@@ positions with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE showed a low inhibit@@ ory ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
in addition , a F@@ V@@ III inhibit@@ or was observed in none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ V@@ III ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical study were 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE against factor V@@ III .
the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contam@@ in@@ ating proteins was analyzed by investigating the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein ; however , there were no signs or symptoms indic@@ ative of an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
four patients were interviewed on the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , con@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophil@@ es gran@@ u@@ lo@@ ytes in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE reported about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ to@@ id reactions ( frequency unknown ) .

all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE were performed on pre@@ treated patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( basic value of factor V@@ III activity ≤ 2 % ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters are derived from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE in 100 previously treated patients equal to or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefit risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE , which requires a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited distributed the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) in December 2008 that the company will withdraw its application for approval for the issu@@ ance of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissues that connects , surrounds and supports other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been modified to produce no copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in could have inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed by the p@@ 53 gene from the human body , usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered .
with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and cancer cells can continue to grow and divide .
the company presented data from a study with a patient , where Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer appeared in the area of the under@@ belly , in the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP checked the answers of the company to the questions asked him , some questions were still unclear .
based on the initial documents submitted , the CH@@ MP generates a list of questions sent to the company by day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion , it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors benefits the patients .
the Committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is not harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP about whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Com@@ passionate Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modified active ingredient &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so composite that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , caused by an allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents aged 12 and over , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( blocked nose ) , are cl@@ utter@@ ed .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the drug may be reduced to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measures were the changes in the severity of hay fever symptoms which were reported by the patients before the onset of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients reported to the aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in the symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine on their own .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients showed a relief of the symptoms at 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who received the disease alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , to adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , urine retention ( high blood pressure ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge ) or have a risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a approval to the company SP Europe for the launching of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the whole European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without tear@@ ing or che@@ wing ) .
due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied to children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have been removed .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , since the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine can decrease over time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as a mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within the 2 weeks after completion of such a therapy .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , Per@@ go@@ eyel@@ id , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiva , which can be used per@@ oral or nas@@ al as a spon@@ ge of Rhin@@ ology ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ haz@@ navi@@ es , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient population and the data is not sufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , abnormal heart rhythms , nausea , or any other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of the head@@ aches ) must be dispos@@ ed of .
treatment of the following patient groups is advised : • Pati@@ ents with digital@@ is • Pati@@ ents with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with hypertension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck and bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must be dep@@ rec@@ ated at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines are otherwise able to prevent or reduce positive reactions for skin reactions .
however , in clinical trials involving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes of the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor tests , no significant differences could be observed between the patients treated with either des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and placebo @-@ treated patients regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines can not be completely ruled out .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the application of a@@ ero during pregnancy is not assured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals do not always be transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to a di@@ zz@@ iness , which may result in impaired mobility or ability to operate machinery .
symptoms may vary between CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tering .
headache , anxiety , ag@@ grav@@ ating muscle tension , euph@@ oria , arous@@ al , breathing in@@ suffici@@ ency , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , per@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ cor@@ di@@ ale pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , vision disorders and hypertension .
CN@@ S stimulation is most likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth dry , pup@@ il rigi@@ dity and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin comfort , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ s as well as in@@ hibition of expression of the adhesi@@ on molecule P @-@ sel@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ chl@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the strengthening of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily did not detect increased drow@@ sin@@ ess frequency compared to placebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in recommended dosage can cause other symp@@ athetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged 12 to 78 have participated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine @-@ antagon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher compared to the total scores for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine during the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than in mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
in terms of gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city , the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets did not show any significant differences .
as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow balance of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were poorly metabol@@ ised .
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ a@@ qui@@ valent was in exposure to the gift of an Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional safety har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , however , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n cannot detect any particular dangers for humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and the pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the relief of allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets allevi@@ ate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and weeping or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
20 In certain circumstances , you may be very sensitive to the mu@@ c@@ ous membrane of the sul@@ fur@@ ic medicine pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , which is included in this medicine .
( diabetes ) , a sten@@ o@@ side stomach ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer , which leads to nar@@ rowing of stomach , small intest@@ ine or es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ) , a closure of the stomach or du@@ o@@ den@@ um , a bladder neck closure , bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the medical history ( short@@ ness of breath due to a cr@@ amp of pul@@ mon@@ ary muscles ) , a prostate enlargement or problems with the liver , kidneys or bladder .
tell your doctor if you can experience or diagnose following symptoms or diseases in the application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • Blood pressure • pac@@ ing , pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders • nausea and head@@ aches , or strengthening of existing head@@ aches .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have taken it recently , even if it is not prescription medicine .
for use in recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to di@@ zz@@ iness or lowers attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze than you ought to immediately inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze than you should .
if you have forgotten the intake of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze If you forgot to take a dose in time , get the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the intended time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects not indicated in this use information .
heart ch@@ asing , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , mouth @-@ drying , di@@ zz@@ iness , sore throat , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness and di@@ zz@@ iness .

after the market launch of L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n very rarely was reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( breathing difficulties , whi@@ stling noise , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves , swelling ) or skin ras@@ hes .
about cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleeping disturbances , muscle pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , over cases of liver inflammation and about cases of show@@ y liver values was also very rare reported .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - ly@@ ophi@@ is@@ at for intake ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml solution .
for children aged 1 to 5 , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) .
efficacy was measured by determining the change in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ rants , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance in the day ) before and after 6 weeks of treatment .
further studies have been presented to prove that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution to the intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us led to an average decrease in the symptom scores ( symptom scores ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a placebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decrease in the symptom scores was after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in the patients treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company SP Europe for the issu@@ ance of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or no meal , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies to effectiveness in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the current disease progression and can be terminated after the symptoms have gone down and can be resum@@ ed when re@@ occurring .
in case of persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( manifestations of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , the patient can be recommended for continuous treatment during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical trials of the L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to di@@ zz@@ iness , which may result in impaired mobility or ability to operate machinery .
clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events reported more often than placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse event was head@@ aches , which occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , which was administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times a clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ s as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesi@@ on molecule P @-@ sel@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses given at a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( nine times the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval occurred .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ chl@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the strengthening of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ dening of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the overall live scores of the questionnaire for the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria has been investigated for further forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar to different forms , and chronic patients can be easily recru@@ ited pro@@ spec@@ tively .
since hist@@ am@@ infection is a caus@@ ative factor in all the ur@@ tic@@ ular diseases , it is expected that in addition to chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n will also lead to an improvement in the symptoms in other forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quad@@ rants at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
an improvement of the itch to more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with chl@@ oram@@ ines compared to 19 % of those treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ efulness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study in which the patient @-@ demo@@ graphics were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after daily use of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines are not entirely excluded .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with lau@@ re@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a comparable degree of exposure to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional trials on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n cannot detect any particular dangers for humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under the age of 2 are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data is available which support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ic anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children ages 2 to 11 met@@ aboli@@ ze des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience higher endurance ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between the ages of 2 and 11 is identical to that of children who are normally met@@ aboli@@ zed .
this drug contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol , alcohol has not increased the performance of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group similar to the placebo group .
clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , which were administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times a clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children aged 1 to 11 , who were eligible for anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily dose of 1,@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ times the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval indicated .
in controlled clinical studies , at recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
at a single dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets performed in adults and adolescents in clinical trials no impair@@ ment of psych@@ om@@ otor therapy .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol was neither a strengthening of alcohol @-@ induced performance impair@@ ment nor an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ dening of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the overall live scores of the questionnaire for the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively decrease the due to seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quad@@ rants at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this restricted met@@ aboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was similar in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ sian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which can be met@@ aboli@@ zed .
the loading ( AU@@ C ) caused by des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of about 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant drug cum@@ ulation following once daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 in various single dose studies showed that the AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines can not be completely ruled out .

clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets than in patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study involving up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times a clinical dose ) .
in two single dose studies A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ times the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval occurred .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily did not detect increased drow@@ sin@@ ess frequency compared to placebo .
in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ chl@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg has no influence on standard measurements of the flight performance , including the strengthening of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ dening of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the overall live scores of the questionnaire for the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

there is limited experience from clinical studies to effectiveness in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melting tray removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg melt tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven .
the overall frequency of side effects between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine si@@ rup and placebo group was the same and did not devi@@ ate significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of ly@@ ophi@@ is@@ at for the decreasing formulation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .

in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ kt@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg has no influence on standard measurements of the flight performance , including the strengthening of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
the spread of this badly met@@ aboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pa@@ edi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was , however , not different from that of the general population .
in single dose crossover studies by A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ is@@ at , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined in pedi@@ atric patients , in conjunction with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between the ages of 2 and 11 is identical to that of children who are normally met@@ aboli@@ zed .
this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 was similar to the placebo group .
in small children between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events reported more often than placebo were diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2.3 % ) .
in an additional study , a one @-@ off dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution could not be observed in patients between 6 and 11 years of age .
at recommended doses the plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical studies , at recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
in addition to established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be dependent on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and

in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company will withdraw its application for A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov &apos;s permission to prevent influenza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily be spread by humans to humans , because humans have no immunity ( no protection ) on the other hand .
after administ@@ ering the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; foreign body &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system is later able to produce faster antibodies when it comes to contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which detects the human body as a body ) , was cleaned and used as part of the vaccine .
a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
should you participate in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your attending physician .
if you wish further information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for intake , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination was not investigated .
as@@ gener@@ a should only be prescribed when the doctor has examined which anti@@ viral drugs the patient has taken before , and the likel@@ ihood of the virus is to be addressed to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice a day , which are taken together with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral drugs twice a day .
for children between the ages of four and twelve , and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ ries is based on body weight .
in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the HIV @-@ amount in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS must not heal but can delay the damage to the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases connected with AIDS .
A@@ gener@@ a was studied in combination with other anti @-@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two major studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the drug A@@ gener@@ ase , which was used with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , was compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who had previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ a , more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ a was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also decreased the viral load , but only very few were treated by the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
in the study of adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ gener@@ ase increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment just as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in the patients with HIV , which had been resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , there was a greater decrease of the viral load after four weeks compared with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the patients who received their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ ries may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
A@@ gen@@ ase may also not be used in patients who use St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement to treat depression ) or medicines which are degra@@ ded as well as ag@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take A@@ gener@@ ase are the risk of li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) or immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the CH@@ MP Committee concluded that the advantages of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti @-@ retro@@ viral drugs used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared with the risks .
A@@ gen@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee found that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; since only limited information was available for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited for the issu@@ ance of A@@ gener@@ alize in the European Union .
A@@ gen@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children aged 4 and over .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not ex@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) need to be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not investigated in children .
A@@ gen@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day in adult patients with moderate liver function disorders twice a day and in patients with severe liver function disturbances to 300 mg twice a day .
the simultaneous use should be done with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver function disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
as@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be informed that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including antibiotic treatment , does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal disease progression .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine .
patients with existing h@@ ep@@ atic function , including chronic @-@ active hepatitis , show an increased frequency of liver function disorders under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored in accordance with clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ co@@ stero@@ ids that are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ idal effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and supp@@ ressing the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin is highly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , an concur@@ rent administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including rh@@ ubar@@ b oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
in patients who take these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , however the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should be monitored for the symptoms of op@@ ium withdrawal , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high pro@@ propylene gly@@ co@@ l content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this dosage form is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ a should be reduced to 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients receiving an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported about the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an ex@@ az@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases where medication was required to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with drug dependent factors , such as prolonged anti @-@ retro@@ viral treatment and related metabolic disorders associated with it .
ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors are reports of an increase of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections resulting in severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial e@@ ology is accepted ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) were reported .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Sub@@ strate with low therapeutic beam A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with drugs whose active ingredients are mainly metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
in the attempt to compensate the degra@@ ded plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often adverse effects on the liver have been observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ ents are and , if possible , to check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s wort .
a dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increase , for C@@ MA@@ x , by contrast , reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical studies doses of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice a day and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day , which prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % reduction if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in the plasma , which were achieved by the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended , as the effectiveness and safety of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , however , due to the an@@ ta@@ zi@@ dis component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine it is recommended that the revenues of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ a are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , with the gift of E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure to both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in possibly lowers the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , care must be taken as del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub @-@ therapeutic plas@@ mas@@ tics .
caution is advised if these drugs are used together ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be made , as accurate pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in a rise in side effects associated with Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dose of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is recommended at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is present .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with azi@@ thro@@ my@@ cin combined with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in case of concur@@ rent administration .
simultaneous use of twice a day 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to 2.@@ 69@@ times compared to the value observed once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can potentially lead to interactions with A@@ gener@@ ase .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids do not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase as it may result in resor@@ ption disorders .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ ants known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma level of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
serum levels of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
simultaneous consumption with A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase the plasma concentrations and intensi@@ fy with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice a day along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days of test subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ interval between 82 and 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , unless the possible benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ idal effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the case of H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose metabolism is highly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , strong increases in plasma levels should be expected at the same time administ@@ ering A@@ gener@@ ase .
since plasma @-@ level increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including a rh@@ ubar@@ b oly@@ sis , the combined use of these medicines is not recommended with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased in the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ alize may not be used together with or@@ ally taken Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while the use of a@@ gener@@ a with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is advised .
data for the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors point to a possible increase in the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 @-@ barrels .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should be monitored for symptoms of op@@ ium withdrawal , especially if also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given at the moment how the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r dose is adjusted if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
in the simultaneous application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase a greater control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with the concur@@ rent gift of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful weighing of the possible benefit for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk of lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into breast milk in people .
a reproductive @-@ study of pregnant rats , administered by the inc@@ isi@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding time of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a decreased increase in 12 body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the further development of the seed , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gen@@ ase has been studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely led to treatment .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are related to taking A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects listed below come from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not treated with pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) assessed by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of patients , as well as laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are performed .
the anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and bilateral fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cereb@@ ral fat accumulation ( Sti@@ ern@@ acken ) .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated persons treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ u@@ din / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine for a mean time of 36 weeks , only one case ( bull attacks ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 patients under am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under inc@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different NR@@ TI@@ s over a mean time of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
ras@@ hes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spontaneously during the second week of treatment and van@@ ished spontaneously within two weeks without having to stop the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in the case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
the type and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were observed very frequently in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase together with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dosage , the patient is to be observed on signs of intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary supporting measures .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral gal@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ e- poly@@ protein levels with the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhi@@ bi@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells .
the relationship between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral previously untreated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
in sixteen out of 4@@ 34 anti @-@ retro@@ viral patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 trial , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred by week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates being gen@@ otyp@@ ically evaluated .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the Isol@@ ate of 13 out of 14 children , where a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 , treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed a resistance pattern similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 5@@ V , D@@ 60@@ E , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 5@@ V , I@@ 5@@ V , I@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / S , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , and L@@ 90@@ M in combination with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as well as a reduced likel@@ ihood of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests based on clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( isolation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four with decreased sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic samples causes a certain cross resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance pathways , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients , in which a Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( one of them demonstrated resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r at the beginning of treatment and another against Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r ) , the inhibit@@ or / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
premature termination of a prescribed therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations which may adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which PI pre@@ treated adults were treated with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ clear @-@ care ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with PI , mainly with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one NR@@ TI@@ s were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis demonstrated the non @-@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ slip threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ born A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children at the age of 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies A@@ generative solution for taking and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice a day .
no low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients with PI previously had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the NR@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of patients included in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to bas@@ eline .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be considered when optimi@@ zing treatment with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) up to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
by contrast , 50@@ 8 % increased , by contrast to C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease of the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosing ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous dietary intake affects the extent and rate of resor@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredient fluctu@@ ates during dosing intervals depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State via the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram base .
also , the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of ren@@ al dys@@ functions on the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is likely to be low .
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma reflection comparable to those obtained in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats occurred h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , from the present exposure data in humans , both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application , there was little evidence for the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gene expression tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation tests on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes included , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen or gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase after the end of the treatment .
studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure under therapeutic dose in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thym@@ us ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed that point to a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) need to be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be done with care in patients with weak or mild liver function problems , in patients with severe liver function disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
A@@ gener@@ a should be dismissed in duration 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug related factors , such as prolonged anti @-@ retro@@ viral treatment and related metabolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increase , for C@@ MA@@ x , by contrast , reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in the plasma , which were achieved by the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended , as the effectiveness and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure to both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
caution is advised if these drugs are used together ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be made , as accurate pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin dosage is recommended at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is present .
serum levels of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice a day along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days of test subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ interval between 82 and 89 % ) .
in the simultaneous application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase a greater control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful weighing of the possible benefit for the mother compared to possible risks to the fet@@ us .
a reproductive @-@ study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the inc@@ isi@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding time of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a decreased increase in body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gen@@ ase has been studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of over@@ dosage , the patient is to be observed on signs of intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary supporting measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhi@@ bi@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be considered when optimi@@ zing treatment with PI pre@@ treated children .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredient fluctu@@ ates during dosing intervals depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State via the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
also , the ren@@ al clearing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of ren@@ al dys@@ functions should be low on the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas occurred in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the genesis of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ele aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , from the present exposure data in humans , both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application , however , little evidence for the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings revealed .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gene expression tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation tests on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen or gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results indicate that the metabol@@ isation paths are not yet fully mature in juven@@ iles , allowing am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
as@@ gener@@ a solution for intake is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children aged 4 and over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake was not covered with PI pre@@ treated patients nor with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not ex@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should , once they are able to swallow the capsules , stop taking the solution to inhal@@ e ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a solution amounts to 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since no dose recommendation can be given for the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake and low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adjustment for Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not deemed necessary , an A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high prop@@ yl@@ gly@@ co@@ l content , A@@ gener@@ ase is a solution for taking infants and children under 4 years of age , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration can lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ( z ) .
patients should be informed that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of HIV transmission to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available .
A@@ gener@@ a should be terminated in the long run if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 depend@@ ant factors , such as prolonged anti @-@ retro@@ viral treatment and related metabolic disorders .
ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors are reports of an increase of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increase , for C@@ MA@@ x , by contrast , reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous consumption with A@@ gener@@ ase may significantly increase the plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am has significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us the prop@@ yl@@ gly@@ co@@ l can not be used during pregnancy ( see Section 4.3 ) .
in the milk of lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into breast milk in people .
a reproductive @-@ study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the inc@@ isi@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding period Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a decreased increase in 55 body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gen@@ ase has been studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are related to taking A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral previously untreated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
early canc@@ erous 60 therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations which may adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be considered when optimi@@ zing treatment with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large ve@@ to volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .

before bed@@ time , the cream is applied to the affected areas of the skin in a thin layer , so that it leaves enough long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with full healing of treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies , in which patients were treated for six weeks , and Al@@ dar@@ a or placebo , either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete treatment of tum@@ ors after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . in the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the total healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with placebo . • The results of both studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ kerat@@ otic , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults , if the size or number of les@@ ions limit the efficacy and / or the acceptance of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
apply Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream is to continue until all visible gra@@ dients have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ canal area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks a treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the above procedure should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if during follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated les@@ ions are only completely healed , another therapy should be initiated ( see section 4.4 ) .
when a dose has been om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and continue with the usual therapy plan .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream is applied in a thin layer and rub@@ bed in the puri@@ fied , with cow@@ ards infected skin area until the cream is fully dra@@ ined .
it should take place in these patients between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host reaction .
in other studies , in which no daily auth@@ oring was performed , two cases of severe hi@@ mo@@ sis and a case with one of the circumc@@ ision @-@ leading strokes were observed .
for an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream in higher than recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irritation were observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or led to a temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the output of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream immediately after treatment with other kut@@ an applied means for the treatment of external inc@@ isions in the genital and peri@@ canal area have not been clinical experience yet .
limited data may indicate an increased rate of cow@@ war@@ dness reductions in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream has shown a lower effectiveness in this patient population in relation to the elimination of the gra@@ dients .
the treatment of the bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips or the hair@@ line was not examined .
local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or the reactions are after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the severity of local skin reactions , a treatment pause can be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy may be judged after the regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the treatment has been cured .
since there is currently no data available on long @-@ term recovery rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other appropriate forms of therapy should be considered in super@@ infected bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs do not have clinical experience , so the use of pre @-@ treated tumours is not recommended .
data from an open clinical study suggest that large tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) are less likely to respond to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine was not investigated for treating ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area inside the lip .
there are only very limited data on the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis in anatom@@ ic places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands do not support the effectiveness in this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity throughout the course of therapy or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
if the local skin reactions cause serious discomfort to the patient or are very strong , treatment may be exposed for a few days .
from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 actors showed a lower total cure rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
because of the immune @-@ stimulating properties I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine should be used with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies do not show any direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fo@@ etus development , development or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although neither once nor after multiple topical application quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) have been achieved , no recommendation can be given during breast@@ feeding .
the most frequently shared and possibly or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream related side effects in the trials involving three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the treatment of cow@@ war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
among the most commonly reported and possibly or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream related side effects include discomfort at the application location with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the bas@@ ali@@ oma patients treated by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream from a placebo @-@ controlled phase III clinical study reported side effects .
the most common , as likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream related side effect , were in these studies a response to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
the side effects that were specified by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies of Phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis are listed below .
this clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials involving three times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream frequently led to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ foli@@ ation / ab@@ sc@@ aling ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
this review , according to the study plan , shows that in these studies , with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream , it often resulted in severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe sc@@ aling ( 19 % ) .
in clinical studies investigating the use of im@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was detected with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
a unique oral intake of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , head@@ aches , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically severe side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was hyp@@ ot@@ ony norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluids .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , systemic concentrations of the alpha @-@ interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected in the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy in relation to complete eradic@@ ation of cow@@ war@@ ts in I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treatment was significantly superior over 16 weeks of placebo treatment .
in 60 % of patients who had been treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , the F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces healed completely ; this was the case with 20 % of the patients who had been treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 15@@ 7 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine &apos;s efficacy in five times a week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically verified individual primary super@@ cardi@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data available from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and that remained for 48 months .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine &apos;s efficacy in three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week treatment @-@ free period , was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ kerat@@ otic , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ - les@@ ions within a coherent 25 c@@ m2 area of treatment on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or face .
the intake data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing following one or two treatments .
the approved indications extern@@ ally gra@@ p@@ ples , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis and super@@ cardi@@ al cell carcin@@ oma generally do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials involving children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine could not be shown in these studies in the doses investigated there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or .
a minimum systemic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ in@@ osis was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest concentrations of drugs in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and dor@@ man@@ t 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the two @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data for systemic exposure showed that the resor@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine after topical application to MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 to 12 was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or super@@ infected bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study of der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg G led to significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study carried out for the der@@ mal application for four months resulted in no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice in three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumours on the application site .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but because I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , a risk for humans is regarded as very low due to systemic exposure .
the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active free cream , earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .
it may harm other people even if these same symptoms have as you do . − If any of the listed side effects you significantly affect or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
● F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces ( Con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) formed on the skin in the area of gen@@ itali@@ a ( sexual organs ) and anus ( after ) have superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma This is a common , slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spread to other parts of the body .
if untreated , it may lead to ab@@ err@@ ations , especially in the face - therefore early detection and treatment is important .
ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses are rough areas of the skin that occur in people who have been exposed to much of sunlight during their lives .
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be used in the face and scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most appropriate treatment for you .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream supports your body &apos;s own immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body fight the superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or the virus responsible for infection with cow@@ war@@ ts .

if your skin re@@ acts too strongly to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not use the cream further to wash the affected area of the skin with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
a low number of blood cells can make you more suscep@@ tible to infections ; it can cause you to create a blue spot faster or you can trigger fatigue .
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you significantly affect or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
in addition , you can find it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas you have applied to Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of patients ) .
mostly these are lighter skin reactions , which will decay within about 2 weeks after the treatment has been removed .
occasionally some patients notice changes in the application location ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , scar@@ ring , skin loss , bli@@ sters , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms is used for enzyme therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( symptoms which are not related to brain or nerve ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non neurological symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , complic@@ ating movements , decreased lung volume , heart and eye diseases .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ ational devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study was mainly examined by the safety of the drug , but it was also measured ( by examining its effect on reducing G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the liver &apos;s size ) .
in children under the age of five Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms reduced the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the children treated showed a normal big liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat @-@ feeling , fever and reactions at the in@@ fusion site .
very common side effects in patients under the age of five are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a meas@@ urable size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms may not be used in patients who may be highly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will examine all new information that may be known , and if necessary , update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms will observe patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in regard to the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for the placing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms across the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with a diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should be done by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries this , every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which re@@ vit@@ ational facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , we expect nearly all patients to form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop antibody or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with care when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
because there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer period of time , the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment must be cau@@ ti@@ ously avoided due to the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity .
60 minutes before starting in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti @-@ py@@ rol@@ ka ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of a mild or moderate in@@ fusion reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be induced and / or a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 are ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there are no data exposed to new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to larv@@ ae of breast milk , it is recommended to breast@@ feed with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me during treatment .
the side effects in clinical studies were predominantly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , which were observed during the phase 3 study and their extension with a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table according to the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre @-@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing silence and facial ede@@ ma ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients under 5 years of age , with predominantly severe follow @-@ up and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients , a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version occurred within 3 months after the onset of the treatment , mostly within one month with a severe follow @-@ up procedure ( average after 26 days versus 45 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until an early departure from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients showed no det@@ ectable antibodies in 13 / 45 patients , including 3 patients with which it has never occurred to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ Version .
patients with low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in urine , whereas in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was detected .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low @-@ neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro , which did not seem to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions although the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the ration@@ ale for the enzyme therapy is one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated medium and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and taken from cells into the lys@@ os@@ omes , most likely about mann@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study that showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms for another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms showed an improvement in lung function and capacity to be treated in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V has not been clin@@ ically significant over this period and the total lung volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the body &apos;s size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a hyst@@ er@@ ec@@ tomy before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a significant drop in the G@@ AG mirror was found in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the end of the study .
overall improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a worsen@@ ing of 9 patients ( 20 % ) was generally observed in 26 patients ( 58 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were studied in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe form of follow @-@ up and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - levels in the urine in week 22 .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined by the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe follow @-@ up form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed normal mental development speed whereas the older patients with severe follow @-@ up were limited or no progress in cognitive development .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms dosing regi@@ mens were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing regi@@ mens is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the drug characteristics will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to that of elderly and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional research on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in a unique gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data will not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
since no compatibility studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines except those listed under 6.@@ 6 .

this tab will provide long @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( Gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans ) , either in small quantities before or this enzyme is completely absent .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the components of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms or if you have a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase has occurred .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
if you use Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you take drugs containing chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine because a possible risk of a reduced effect of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms exists .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other drugs or recently taken , including non @-@ prescription drugs .
instructions for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted before application and is intended for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for physicians or medical professionals ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries this , every 15 minutes gradually to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ II @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing silence and facial ede@@ ma .
very common ( occurrence of more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • headache • nausea , abdominal pain • rash • A@@ ther@@ mia , joint pain , back pain , pain in the arms and legs • Incre@@ ased pulse • hypertension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action to the in@@ fusion site

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( medi@@ cam@@ ents against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer that does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not yet been treated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regi@@ mens .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti @-@ em@@ etic &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a lack of fluid ) should be given .
in patients whose blood @-@ image changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , set aside or the dose can be reduced .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
the transformation of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is more readily available in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active life in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another cancer drug ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1,@@ 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
patients who had previously received chemotherapy had an average survival time of 8.@@ 3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months compared to doc@@ et@@ axel .
in both studies , however , patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells did longer survive in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta than with the comparison medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission approved the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for the issu@@ ance of A@@ lim@@ ta throughout the European Union .
each pier@@ cing bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a resolution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - sis is extracted and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma except for predomin@@ ant disc epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in the second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - k@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma except for predomin@@ ant disc epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface area ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma after preceding chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given on the day before and on the day after treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also need to receive an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) a week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after each third irrigation cycle .
in patients who receive P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood image should be created before every gift , including differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te um@@ eration .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place taking into account the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of prev@@ ent@@ ative treatment cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
if patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ 360 degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before treatment
the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ ti@@ - a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity grade 3 or 4 occurs or so on the occurrence of degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical trials did not show that patients aged 65 years of age or over 65 years of age had an increased risk of side effects .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to inadequate data on safety and efficacy .
in clinical studies , no dose adap@@ tations were necessary for patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ as@@ en@@ values of &gt; the 3,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the absence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 @-@ times the upper limit value ( for presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not studied specifically in the studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ su@@ re@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ora count once again reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te number has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of absolute neutr@@ ality , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in the previous cycles of treatment ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ ab@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was be@@ ached when pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed need to be used to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ yl@@ actic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous use of non@@ stero@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to treatment , on the day of therapy and minimum 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients for treating p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed should avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days prior to treatment , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients in whom these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hypertension or diabetes .
therefore , a drainage of the eff@@ usion is to be induced in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space prior to p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed treatment .
5 Sever@@ al cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials involving p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasional , if this substance was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated live vacc@@ ines ( except ja@@ un@@ dice , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage of reproductive capacity by means of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised against the treatment regi@@ men to obtain advice regarding the retention of sperm .
in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non@@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ inflammatory drugs ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can lead to reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of an increased incidence of side effects .
therefore , caution is advised if in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be applied in high doses .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days prior to the therapy , be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since no data is available for interaction with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , simultaneous use with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be avoided at least 5 days prior to the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - mixed .
the in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interaction between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy .
p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be used during pregnancy , except if necessary and after careful consideration of the benefit for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
given the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to reproductive capacity by means of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised to consult with regard to the blocking of the sperm .
it is not known whether p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed passes into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed infant cannot be excluded .
the following table shows the incidence and severity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma who were random@@ ised to C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , as well as 16@@ 3 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma who received c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity , which were reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who were random@@ ized P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , comprised su@@ pra@@ v@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as .
clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity grade 3 and 4 was similar to the three single p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed mono@@ therap@@ ic studies ( n = 16@@ 4 ) , except for neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase of al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to lead to differences in the patient population because the pha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and significantly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal levels of liver function tests .
the following table shows the incidence and severity of adverse effects that could be possible in connection with study medication ; they were reported at &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 patients with NSCLC who were random@@ ised to receive C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and 8@@ 30 patients with NSCLC who were random@@ ised to c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ abine .

for this table , a threshold of 5 % was set for the inclusion of all events in which the report doctor considered a connection with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity reported to ≥ 1 % and ≤ 5 % ( often ) of patients who received random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and pe@@ an@@ et@@ re@@ xed were :
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity , which were reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received ran@@ o- dom@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , included :
serious cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular cl@@ ero@@ sis and tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks were occasionally reported in clinics with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , which is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
in patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment , cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal perfor@@ ations , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ litis ) were reported in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
in clinical trials patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed @-@ treatment were occasionally reported cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency .
it was reported on cases of acute ren@@ al failure in p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy drugs ( see section 4.4 ) .
cases of radi@@ ated pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients that were ir@@ radi@@ ated before , during or after their p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti @-@ fol@@ ate which performs its effect by interrup@@ ting weight @-@ dependent metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed acts as an anti@@ qu@@ ate with multiple targets by blocking the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ l@@ syn@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ logical reduc@@ t@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ c@@ ami@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ d@@ for@@ - my@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are the follow @-@ up key enzymes of the de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ ine and pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi @-@ centric , random@@ ised , random@@ ised Phase 3 trial of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin against c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma demonstrated that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically significant benefit of medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ month survival compared to patients treated with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received test medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) compared to the C@@ is@@ plague tin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms of the arms showed an improvement in lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and the in@@ timi@@ dation of lung function over time in the control arm .
a mul@@ tic@@ entr@@ e , random@@ ised , open phase III trial with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA versus doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC confirmed medi@@ an survival of 8.@@ 3 months ( int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9.@@ 3 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adjusted HR = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a random@@ ised , controlled Phase 3 study showed efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ em@@ et@@ ri@@ ctions between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 5@@ 40 ) pre @-@ treatment similar to doc@@ et@@ axel .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ superi@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
mean P@@ FS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.@@ 15 ) , the overall response rate was 30.@@ 6 % ( 95 % CI = 27.@@ 3 - 3@@ 3.@@ 9 ) for combining gem@@ cit@@ abine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the impact of NSCLC &apos;s hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences in hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = value @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ superi@@ ority , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ base limit of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .

the resulting solution is clear and the colouring varies from color@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish without compromising the quality of the products .
it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet .
patients who use All@@ i and do not receive weight after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot metabol@@ ise some fats in the food , causing about a quarter of the fats attributed to food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed to the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared with 3@@ 91 overweight patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who received the All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed in patients with BM@@ I of 25 to 28 kg / m2 .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stains on anus , fl@@ atus ( winds ) with a chair lab@@ eling , stu@@ h@@ ld@@ l , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , finish o@@ ily secre@@ tions ( f@@ ences ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft chairs .
it may not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in tran@@ spl@@ ant patients ) or medicines like war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients from the digestive tract ) or chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) suffer , and pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited approval for the incor@@ poration of or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K across the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body Mass Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in combination with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ oric , fatty diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all@@ i should not be applied by children and young people under 18 because there is not enough data on efficacy and safety . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally absorbed , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for elderly people and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see section 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the likel@@ ihood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich meal or low @-@ fat diet .
because weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting treatment with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic must be adjusted possibly .
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dose of this drug must be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnant measures to prevent potential failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma level was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( internationally normally ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at remained the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta carot@@ ene in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take a supple@@ mental vitamin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the dose of a single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time , a slight decrease in A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration .
experimental studies did not show any direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are associated with pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug , because the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1.000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data ) .
the incidence of unknown side @-@ effects noted after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of some size .
† It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can cause anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obes@@ e subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosing , either side effects or similar adverse events were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on studies on humans and animals can be assumed from a rapid reg@@ ression of any systemic effects caused by the im@@ pass@@ able properties of or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect places in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine due to co@@ valent bonds to the active Ser@@ in @-@ Rest of the ga@@ str@@ e and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
derived from clinical studies , 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled trials in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at that was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ orial , low @-@ fat diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to bas@@ eline ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a percentage of those participating in study who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the biggest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in the Gesamt@@ chol@@ esterin was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( starting value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol with or@@ list@@ at was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( starting value 3,@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( starting value 3,@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at the waist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60@@ mg ( starting value 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( starting value 10@@ 3,5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metabol@@ ised or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , met@@ aboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be detected spor@@ adi@@ cally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .
two major metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after separation of the N @-@ Form@@ yl @-@ Leu@@ cin group ) were identified in a study of obes@@ e patients , which represented approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentration .
based on conventional trials on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gene ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ous potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data is no particular danger to humans .

the BM@@ I helps you to determine if you have a normal weight or overweight in relation to your body size .
even if these diseases first do not cause you to feel uncomfortable , you should nevertheless ask your doctor for a control examination .
for each 2 kg body@@ weight that you lose as part of a diet , you can lose an extra kil@@ ogram with the help of all@@ i .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in is used after organ transplan@@ ts , severe rheumatoid arthritis and certain serious skin conditions . • War@@ far@@ in or other medicines that have a blood @-@ th@@ inning effect .

to get used to your body &apos;s new eating habits , start your first capsule intake with a cal@@ orie and fatty diet .
food di@@ aries are effective , as you can always understand what you eat , how much you eat and it will probably be easier to change your eating habits .
to ensure your target weight is safe , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat .
• Di@@ et fatty foods to decrease the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related side effects ( see paragraph 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking the capsules .
remember to ask your doctor prior to your doctor if you are not used to physical activity . • Sta@@ y physically active during intake and after completion of the intake of all@@ i .
• all@@ i may not be taken for more than 6 months . • If you cannot determine any reduction of your weight after twelve weeks of use of all@@ i , ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice .
you may need to quit the intake of all@@ i . • With a successful weight loss , it is not a matter of changing the diet in the short term and then returning to old habits .
• If less than one hour has passed since the last meal , take the capsule after . • If more than one hour has passed since the last meal , take no capsule .
flat@@ ul@@ ence with and without a small discharge , sudden or aug@@ mented mare urge and soft chair ) can be attributed to the mechanism of action ( see section 1 ) .
severe allergic reactions • severe allergic reactions can be seen in the following changes : severe breathing difficulties , sweat drops , ras@@ hes , it@@ ching , swelling in the face , heart rate , circul@@ atory breakdown .
29 Very frequent side effects These can occur in over 1 out of 10 people who take all@@ i . • flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) with and without a small discharge • Pl@@ ötz@@ lich mare urge • F@@ rom@@ eter or o@@ ily chair • Wei@@ cher chair inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of these side effects are increased or you significantly affect you .
common side effects These can occur in 1 out of 10 people who take all@@ i . • stomach ( abdominal ) pain , • In@@ kontin@@ enz ( stool ) • aqu@@ eous / liquid stools • Incre@@ ased bow@@ string urge • Def@@ ine your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of these side effects intensi@@ fies or you significantly affect you .
effects on blood tests It is not known how often these effects occur . • Incre@@ ase of certain liver enzyme levels • Eff@@ ect on blood cl@@ ot@@ ting in patients who take war@@ far@@ in or other blood dil@@ uted ( anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) medicines .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects not indicated in this use information .
the most common side effects are associated with the effects of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of the treatment , because at this time you may not have reduced fat in your diet .
with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize the nutritional symptoms : • Beg@@ inning some days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood of losing your fat limit decreases . • Share your recommended amount evenly to the daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you may eat per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a substantial night table as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction .
• Ke@@ ep out of the reach of children . • Do not use any more than 25 ° C after the exp@@ iry date specified on the box . • Ke@@ ep container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with Si@@ lic@@ agel , which serve to keep the capsules dry .
don &apos;t swallow it . • You can carry your daily dose all@@ i in the blue box ( shuttle ) that is included in this pack .

overweight has an impact on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • hypertension • Diabetes • Heart Disease • Stro@@ ke • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis do you with your doctor about your risk of these diseases .
sustained weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and have a positive impact on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to eat healthy .
energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you will also find in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take up to a maximum per day .
note the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with every meal .
which quantity is suitable for you , refer to the information below that indicates the number of calories that are suitable for you . • The basis of the capsule &apos;s mode of action is the adher@@ ence to recommended fat intake .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this may mean that your body cannot handle this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ise weight and at the same time reduce the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related side effects .
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to lose weight incre@@ mentally and continuously about 0.5 kg per week without developing frustr@@ ations and disappointment .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Physi@@ cal Activity &quot; means that you daily burn 150 k@@ cal daily , e.g. through 3 km of walking , 30 to 45 minutes of gardening or 2 km of running in 15 minutes .
• For sustained weight loss , it is necessary to set up realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and adhere to it . • Sinn@@ fully is a food diary containing information on cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i programme to support weight loss combines the capsules with a diet plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed on cal@@ orie and fatty diets and give guidelines to become more physically active .
in combination with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , this information can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies that are strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a drug that can be used as an anti @-@ em@@ etic ) .
the application for patients under the age of 18 is not recommended , as there are not enough information on the effects of this age group .
this means that the substance inhi@@ bits binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , which prevents recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three major studies of 1,@@ 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies which are strong and moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chemotherapy , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with anal@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting ( 132 from 2@@ 23 ) in the 24 hours after chemotherapy , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in the 24 hours after chemotherapy , 81 % of patients treated with anal@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 from 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued approval to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . , a licence for the marketing of Alo@@ xi in the European Union .
Alo@@ is is indicated : for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of cancer .
the effectiveness of alo@@ xi to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting caused by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids given prior to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the colon , patients with am@@ nesty ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advised with the simultaneous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines which extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ t interval is extended or which tend to be an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is not used to prevent or treat nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not block the activity of the five examined chemotherapy drugs ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ abine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ ine and mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady St@@ ate@@ - concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ran@@ iti@@ dine , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ aline and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience for the use of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician .
in clinical studies , the most common adverse events were observed in a dose of 250 mc@@ g. ( total 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least possibly were related to Alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration of administration ( burning , curing , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dosage showed similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effective relationships to observe .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were performed , however , due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for an over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life : 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given , that was given intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic treatment with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared with patients who received 32 mg On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of the studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study conducted at 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of administered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
resor@@ ption After intraven@@ ous injection follows an initial decrease of plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average termin@@ ale half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportional in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3@@ 90 μ g / kg for patients and cancer patients .
after intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean mean ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations show that the total text position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) obtained at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable with a once @-@ once intraven@@ ous dose of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the one @-@ off dose of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies on metabol@@ isation , we showed that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the iso@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ modified substance made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous injection , the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in patients with severe liver function impair@@ ment , the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after expos@@ ures , which are considered to be sufficiently exposed to the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , evidence suggests that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channels , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and can pro@@ long the amount of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose was about 30 times the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tumours , en@@ doc@@ rine Ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mark ) and skin tumours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dosage and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report recommen@@ ding the approval of the drug Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution intended for the treatment of hepatitis C .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference drug &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( liver disease caused by a viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic examination the liver tissue has been damaged , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood ab@@ normally increase .
it is produced by yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which stimulates the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presents data showing the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , effectiveness , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients .
in the study it was measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment responded to the medication ( i.e. no evidence of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non business purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
in addition , concerns have been expressed that data is not sufficient for the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed .
the number of patients with hepatitis C , which responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study .
after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease was reduced to more patients than with the reference drug ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study was not sufficiently vali@@ dated to the extent to which the medicine triggers an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) .
it can be used for the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( skin infection ) and small infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( torn or cut wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used for treating infections that have been prov@@ able or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because it may not affect these kinds of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 , the area to be treated should not be more than 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cl@@ utter@@ ed after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients with placebo spoke to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected dogs Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together at home dogs , about 90 % of the patients responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go is not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ice @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections that have been prov@@ ably or probably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irritation on the surface of the order .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . , a permit for the issu@@ ance of al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the event of a sensi@@ tization or serious local irritation by applying Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment should be stopped , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully bl@@ urred and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection will begin .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not intended to treat infections where MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or is suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient in clinical trials .
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical means on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical use on sc@@ rap@@ ed skin or infected superficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneously oral administration of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole the mean retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x increased after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on sc@@ rap@@ ed skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients , dose adap@@ tations are not considered necessary if top@@ ographic ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in regards to a statement on the effects on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the application of a systemic antibiotic .
the decision whether the breast@@ feeding should be continued / terminated or the treatment with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated is to balance between the benefit of breast@@ feeding and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which Al@@ tar@@ go have applied , the most commonly reported side effect irritation at the administration of administration , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
effect Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation of C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ wort @-@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ wort @-@ anus ) .
the mechanism of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of the bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding point of the 50s sub @-@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data suggests that the binding site of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase center .
by binding at this binding post P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pep@@ tide transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interventions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
should , due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms appear to be question@@ able , consultation by experts should be sought .
no differences were found in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ response to treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
resor@@ ption In a study of healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily in occ@@ lu@@ sion on intact and on lac@@ ed skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for the topical treatment of secondary traumati@@ zed wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
samples were taken on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic absorption in humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 of sc@@ rap@@ ed skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP escap@@ ement .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ s was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with minor involvement of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on the oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were performed over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in @-@ vitro @-@ examination on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in rats @-@ micro @-@ core test for in @-@ vi@@ vo investigation of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rat signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , thus reaching up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure in humans ( topical application to 200 c@@ m2 of sc@@ rap@@ ed skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats were detected in oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to ≥ 3 @-@ times of estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity .

Ambi@@ lla is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years , who are not immune to these two diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ lla is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may be achieved only after the second dose is given . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , Ambi@@ lla may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection while immun@@ ization is low and that the vacc@@ ination from two doses can be put to an end .
if a refres@@ her dose of hepatitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ ata or other hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vacc@@ ines work by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teach &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defense ) as it can defend itself against a disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after receiving the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ lla has the same components as the vaccine granted since 1996 and the vaccine granted since 1997 and the vaccine granted since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ul@@ ts and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses .
because Ambi@@ lla and Twin@@ rix contain adult identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ul@@ ts have also been used as evidence for the use of Ambi@@ lla .
the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentrations a month after the last inj@@ ections .
in an additional study involving 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ lla conducted a month after the last inj@@ ections to the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of Ambi@@ ence protection was similar to a six @-@ month interval between the inj@@ ections .
the most common adverse events of Ambi@@ lla ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain in the injection area , redness , mat@@ ch@@ iness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ lla may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als s.@@ a. a permit for the marketing of Ambi@@ lla in the whole
the standardi@@ zation plan for immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ inations , with the first dose on the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination is required for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ Hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ Hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ Hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s ) are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent individuals who have responded to hepatitis C vacc@@ ination may need a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in non @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all inj@@ ections vacc@@ ines , for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the administration of the vaccine , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately .
if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody levels under certain circumstances , so that in these cases additional doses of vacc@@ ination can be required .
since intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ lication , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
however , in cases of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , Ambi@@ lla can be inj@@ ected in an exceptional way , as it can occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration .
when Ambi@@ lla was administered in the second year in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined diar@@ rhe@@ a , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it may be assumed that a sufficient immune response may not be achieved .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ch@@ iness , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thi@@ omer@@ cial and preserv@@ ative @-@ based vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ inations were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to including 15 years , Ambi@@ lla &apos;s toler@@ ability was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ iness on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination dose , but not on a basis of a calculation per person .
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ lla at 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the dose of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ rix reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % with the subjects vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ch@@ iness was comparable to per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of subjects who received Ambi@@ lla , compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine ) .
the incidence of severe pain and mat@@ ernal mortality was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ gruppe was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11@@ - year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ lla , a more common incidence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the proportion of vacc@@ ines that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose immun@@ otherapy with Ambi@@ lla or during the 3 @-@ dose immun@@ otherapy with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B - was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to including 15 years , Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion@@ rates for Anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ lla and 147 received the standard combin@@ ation@@ vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was invaluable , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against Hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the dose of the 3 @-@ dose @-@ im@@ pa@@ yer significantly higher than with Ambi@@ lla .
the immune responses , which were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11 year olds one month after completion of the full vaccine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ dose @-@ vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ lla or a 3 @-@ dose @-@ vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for persons aged between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immun@@ ization with Ambi@@ lla in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune response observed in this study was comparable to that , which was determined after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - and including 15 year olds , it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies 24 months after immun@@ ization in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
when the first dose Ambi@@ lla was administered at the same time with the refresh of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study carried out with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective and ser@@ ode conver@@ sions as for the previous formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ se on any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through food and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other channels , such as swimming in water contaminated water .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ lla cannot completely protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the full vaccine series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child are already infected with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus before administ@@ ering both doses ( although you / your child will not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of the vaccine ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those after hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection can not be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ lla or any component of this vaccine , including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can be expressed by it@@ ching skin ras@@ hes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you / your child already have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccine against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B , if you / your child have a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly protect against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usual dose of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
at a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ lla .
instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vacc@@ ination against completion of the vaccine series .
sometimes Ambi@@ lla becomes a person who suffers from severe blood cl@@ utter disorders , under the skin and not inj@@ ected into the muscle . • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defense / or if you / your child undergo / undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ lla may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take other medicines ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child has been recently vacc@@ inated or has been given / or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibody ) has received / has or is planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ lla , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different limbs as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ lla is not given to pregnant or breast@@ feeding women , but it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
please inform your doctor if you already have an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) with you and your child .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 de@@ composed doses ) : • P@@ ain or discomfort at the inser@@ tion point or redness • Mat@@ ter • irrit@@ ability • headache • loss of appetite
♦ only ( up to 1 case per 10 ) : • swelling at the injection site • Temper@@ ature ( above 38 ° C ) • Respon@@ sible • gastro@@ intestinal complaints
other side effects , which were reported very rare days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 vacc@@ inated doses ) are :
these include locally restricted or extended ras@@ hes that can be it@@ ching or b@@ lower , swelling of the eye and face , ag@@ grav@@ ating breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden drop in blood pressure and un@@ consciousness .

23 Find your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you / your child significantly affect or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this package insert .
Ambi@@ lla is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data , which have been known since the issu@@ ance of first approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP noted that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ lla remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was only launched in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug are limited due to the low patient exposure .
form@@ al@@ dehy@@ de can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzyme defects or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in the pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ia is - divided into several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ es@@ sis ( through the abdominal wall in the stomach of leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose in the stomach of leading tube ) administered .
it was not a comparative study , as ammon@@ ia could not be compared with a different treatment or placebo ( a pseu@@ do@@ drug , i.e. without active substance ) .
ammon@@ ia can also lead to loss of appetite , low levels of aci@@ dity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disorders or flavor release , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the CH@@ MP Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevents high ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ammon@@ ia was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information to this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enz@@ ym@@ atic deficiency has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days ) .
in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ fol@@ ate form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests after the first month of life ) , there is an indication for use when there is a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ule form .
the daily dose is individually calculated taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the patient &apos;s growth and development .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight exceeding 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine tran@@ scar@@ ate syndrome .
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must be obtained ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders because there is a risk of the formation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a when the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which is equivalent to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
because metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is carried out via the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used only with extreme caution in patients with liver or ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
for sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal proliferation and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed ri@@ pen@@ ing of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a decreased number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in humans in breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding time ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least 56 % of patients had at least an un@@ desirable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not connected with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old abnormal patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate dose , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anc@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of an over@@ dose entered a 5 month old small child with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ lically active compound that con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram bi@@ ased sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival and clinical outcome .
the prog@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ used , and the disease itself led to death in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or their sti@@ cky an@@ alogues within the first year of life .
by means of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative pathways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced food and possibly substitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born in post@@ part@@ um ( however within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients there was time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ f@@ al form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ spon@@ ge scar@@ red deficiency ) , which were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible for treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is associated with glut@@ amine in the liver and kidneys , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis according to individual indications as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ates and metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following IV administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate were detected .
after different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day to 20 g / day ) was no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate det@@ ectable in the plasma after different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver , which were repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the average phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher on the third day compared to the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys within 24 hours of approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate had no compla@@ ining effects ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who can not swallow tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ or or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ born infants , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight exceeding 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine tran@@ scar@@ ate syndrome .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which is equivalent to the maximum daily dose .
when rats were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ) , les@@ ions were found in the pyr@@ ami@@ ds of the brain cor@@ tex .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old abnormal patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate dose , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anc@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that for each gram the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
already existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible for treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in gran@@ ule form 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate were detected .
during the duration of the shelf life , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
the small measuring spoon is 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon is 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate .
if a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing , so they cannot secre@@ te the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins .
if laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate may affect the results of certain laboratory investigations .
if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
during breast@@ feeding , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the drug may pass into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , head@@ aches , taste disturbances , reduction of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory problems and deterioration of existing neurological conditions were observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , immediately contact your doctor or with the emergency treatment of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating appropriate treatment .
if you miss the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in the blood image ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , unpleasant skin smell , rash , ren@@ al dysfunction , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects not indicated in this use information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can no longer use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS according to the exp@@ ir@@ ation date on the cart@@ on and container after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Use up to &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS together with the same single doses or@@ ally or via a stomach fi@@ st@@ ula ( tube that goes directly into the stomach through the abdominal wall ) or a nas@@ al probe ( tube that is led through the nose to the stomach ) .
31 • Take a sco@@ op of gran@@ ulate from the container . • Fil@@ l a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the top of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • Take the recommended number of measuring spo@@ ons of gran@@ ules from the container .
angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example with unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; sting &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measurement value in the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is given and in@@ fusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of angi@@ ox in sole administration or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI the patient was often used as a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and A@@ spir@@ in .
in the treatment of AC@@ S Angi@@ ox - with or without the Gift of G@@ PI - was just as effective in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks , or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as well as conventional treatment .
in patients undergoing a PCI , Angi@@ ox was as effective as he@@ par@@ in in relation to all indicators , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bias , other brain ud@@ ine or any of the other components .
it may also not be used in patients who recently had hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , as well as in people with strong high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Angi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . , a permit for the incor@@ poration of angi@@ ox across the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ up@@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or early intervention .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous injection of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if the patient subsequently performs a PCI , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion can be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of surgery .
after the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements .
immediately before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is to be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI is of an initial intraven@@ ous injection of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and one intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a certain Bol@@ us administration of angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be done .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT levels , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted drug should be carefully mixed before the application and the d@@ osed dose can be administered rapidly intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate ren@@ al impair@@ ment ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ira or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be given and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose can be checked again .
in patients with moderate ren@@ al damage , included in the II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which was included , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the application of the Bi@@ val@@ ira @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients Angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous injection of frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or other components or against mil@@ ud@@ ine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to mal@@ functioning of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in system and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible co@@ ag@@ ulation disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hypertension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if Bi@@ val@@ ira is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if PCI patients under Bi@@ val@@ ira occur most bleeding in arter@@ ial pun@@ cture points , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may occur during the treatment in principle throughout ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges .
in patients who take war@@ far@@ in and be treated with Bi@@ val@@ ira , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be taken into consideration to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ira reach the existing level before treatment .
based on knowledge about the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations ) , it can be assumed that these active agents increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of Bi@@ val@@ ent@@ u@@ din with thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are regularly checked regularly .
in relation to the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development , animal experiments are inadequate ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ira alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ira plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ question@@ able he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ira Group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , there were more adverse events in women as well as patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined according to the A@@ cu@@ ity and Tim@@ i scales for severe bleeding such as in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and severe ble@@ ed@@ ings were significantly less common under Bi@@ val@@ ira than in groups with he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an ag@@ cu@@ ity severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ arter@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the point area , which required radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , reduction of the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in level of ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known bleeding center , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with a well @-@ known bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed blood loc@@ aliz@@ ations , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; points of position , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following data about side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with Bi@@ val@@ ira in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ira Group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , there were more adverse events in women as well as patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients .
both mild and severe ble@@ ed@@ ings were significantly less common under Bi@@ val@@ ira than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported after a comprehensive application in practice and are grouped according to system organ classes in Table 6 .
in case of an over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ valent ud@@ ine must be stopped immediately and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding .
angi@@ ox contains bi@@ valent inhibit@@ or , a direct and specific plat@@ el@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds to the cataly@@ tic center as well as to the an@@ di@@ lation region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether thro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the fluid phase or cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ira to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is rever@@ sible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in on its part breaks the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ira @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thus re@@ generating the function of the active centre of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ in .
in addition , there were no thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) .
in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ val@@ ira has a dose @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is demonstrated by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was carried out in the following cases , an additional bolt of 0,@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ira should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of surgery can be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in arm A of the A@@ cu@@ ity study , frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable Ang@@ ina / Non @-@ ST lever inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the beginning of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or PCI .
in the A@@ cu@@ ity study the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were distributed evenly across the 3 arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent surgery within 72 hours of an angi@@ ography .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is administered sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or insulin cannot be processed effectively .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has shorter working duration than a short @-@ acting human@@ insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and enrolled in a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 .
in type 2 diabetes , in which the body cannot be processed effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed after six months compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin lis@@ p .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentrations was 0.@@ 46 % after six months compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin l@@ ul@@ ins or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra can be used as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection in either the abdominal wall , th@@ ig@@ h or delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the pancre@@ as .
due to reduced glu@@ con@@ ic capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , the need for insulin can be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function .
any change of the effectiveness , the brand ( her@@ - or ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ retar@@ ded , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can result in a change in insulin requirements .
3 An insufficient dosage or abor@@ tion of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
changing a patient to a different type of insulin or an insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the effectiveness of the insulin and can therefore change during the conversion of the treatment diagram .
the substances that can increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia include oral anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ yr@@ amide , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , among the effects of sympath@@ oly@@ tics such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ ane@@ thi@@ dine and Reser@@ pin may be weakened or missing symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation .
experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in occurs in human breast milk , but generally insulin does not involve breast milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to oral use .
the following are listed in clinical trials , sorted by system organ classes and sorted by decreasing frequency of occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on available data ) .
cold - Wel@@ ness , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , concentration distur@@ b@@ ance , di@@ zz@@ iness , confusion , lack of vision , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is om@@ itted to continuously change the injection area within the injection area , as a result , a li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy may occur at the injection point .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by means of an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by an appropriately trained person , or by intraven@@ ous glucose by a doctor .
after glu@@ co@@ ag@@ ine injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to investigate the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose absorption ( especially skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the effectiveness occurs faster and the duration of action is shorter than with cou@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes m@@ illi , insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range from 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a dose proportional to glucose @-@ reducing effect , and at 0.3 mg / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ ity @-@ reducing effect , just like human@@ insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ ity effect about 2 hours earlier as a human insulin .
from the data it was obvious that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post @-@ den@@ al gly@@ cem@@ ic control is reached like with human insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in was applied 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ p@@ den@@ al control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is applied in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with human normal insulin , which is given 2 Mi@@ - gro@@ o@@ ves before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in for 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in for 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human normal mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L before ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
