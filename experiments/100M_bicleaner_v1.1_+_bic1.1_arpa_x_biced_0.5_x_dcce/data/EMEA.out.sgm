<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg of melt tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth) as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirl thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), mistrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental disorder where the patients have manic episodes (periods of anorexia) alternate with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe severe episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased restlessness or behavioural disturbances when the oral consumption of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used to inhale or melt tablets in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who take other medicines at the same time, which are degraded as well as Abilify, the dose should be adjusted by Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this interferes with the signal transmission between brain cells by" "" "neurotransmitters," "" "i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole probably works primarily as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripipezol like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to lesser extent than the neurotransmitter works to activate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing its recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent the recurrence of the symptoms was studied in three trials for up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that suffered from increased anxiety over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, to 160 patients in whom the manic symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify Injection Solution was compared in a study involving 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from increased anxiety with which from Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medicine) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients was investigated using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the enamel tablets and the solution to take in.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg were significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effectively than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition to 74 weeks Abilify also prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased anxiety and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disruption, diarrhoea, somnolence (drowsiness), diarrhoea (drowsiness), nausea and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to heavy manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes continued to prevail against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee concluded that the benefits of injection solution in fast control of increased anxiety and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission issued a licence to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd., a permit for the incorporation of Abilify across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes to the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day each day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased effectiveness in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the recommended dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after menopausal therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with aripibozol compared to other anti-psychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripipezol should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, cardiac insufficiency, overflow disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines) or hypertension (including active and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports about dyskinesia occurring during the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the symptoms and symptoms of late dyskinesia treated with Abilify, should be taken into consideration, reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripipezol should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or at conditions associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripipezol in patients with psychosis who are associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripivzol had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosages, a significant relationship between dosage and response for undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripibrazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no accurate risk assessments for hyperglycemia related adverse events treated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents treated patients who permit direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly with regard to worsening glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary efficacy of Aripibozol on the central nervous system, caution is advised if Aripibozol is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically unrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy subjects, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripibozol by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolisers can result in common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripibozol compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the joint administration of ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting up the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of Abilify should be lifted to the dose height prior to the start of the companion therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem (or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 can be administered together with Abilify, with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextrometamorphous / 3-methoxymorphine-ratio), 2C19 (Warfarin), 2C19 (OmePrazol) and 3A4 (Dextrometamorphous).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used in pregnancy because of the lack of data on humans and due to the concerns generated in reproductive studies in animal studies, unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other anti-psychotics, patients should be warned against dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are sure that Aripibozol has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: common (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study of over 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Aripivzol, a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including Parkinsonism, Akathalie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia, compared with patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with aripibozol treatment and 13.1% in patients was placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% in patients treated with Aripivzol and 15.1% in patients with Olanzapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% in patients with regard to aripibozol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of more than 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients with aripibozol treatment and 17.6% for those with lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripivzol- Treatment and 15.7% for placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripibozol and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters were detected, did not result in medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases in CPK (creatine phosphate kinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripibrazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Side effects related to antipsychotic therapy, and also reported in the treatment with Aripivzol, include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintended or unintentional acute overdosages with aripibozol alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">There is no information on the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripibozol; however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdosage, as Aripipezol has a high plasmaprotein bandaging.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of aripibozol in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder over the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine dopamine and serotonin 5HT1- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole showed in vitro a high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and for serotonin 5HT1- and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and to the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks of healthy subjects, positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in binding of 11C-raccoprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, on the caudatus and the putty.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study 52 the share of responder patients, which kept a response to the study medication, was similar in both groups (Aripipezol 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from the measurement scales defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression scale, showed a significantly greater improvement than in haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole showed a significantly higher return rate, 34% in the Aripibozol group and 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapine-controlled multi-blind study of schizophrenia over 26 weeks that included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy trials with flexible dose over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripipezol showed a versus placebo-superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripipezol showed no superior efficacy against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and actively controlled monotherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, Aripipezol showed a efficacy in week 3 versus placebo, comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Also in week 12 Aripiprazole demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania like lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which in some cases did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the adjuvant therapy with Aripiprazole revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved a remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilisation phase, Aripipezol was superior to the prevention of a bipolar regression, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxyation of Aripibozol, the N-dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination rate is approximately 75 hours for aripibozol in extensive metabolisation via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'poor' (= poor poor) metabolites via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as a pharmacokinetic study of schizophrenic patients with no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A simulation-specific analysis of pharmacokinetics did not indicate clinically significant differences in respect to ethnicity or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripivzol and Dehydro-Aripivzol were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function to pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripivzol, but the study included only 3 patients with hepatic cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional research on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, gene otoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans, so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal rinse toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchyma loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase of adrenal rinady carcinomas / carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10x of average Steady State exposure (AUC) at recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">Moreover, cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1 to 3 times the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations found in the human gall at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy- Aripibozol found no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the gall of monkeys, and lie far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed following dosages, which led to expositions of the 3 and 11-fold of the central Steady State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status, taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute treatment (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If an additional oral treatment with Aripibozol is indicated, see the summary of the features of the drug to Abilify tablets, Abilify Melting tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no investigations on the efficacy of Aripivzol injection solution in patients with agility and behavioural disorders that were different from schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines in addition to the Aripibrazole injection solution is deemed necessary, patients should be observed in terms of extreme sedation or a blood pressure drop (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Studies on the safety and efficacy of Aripivzol injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (by prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripipezol should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, cardiac insufficiency, overflow disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines) or hypertension (including active and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports about dyskinesia occurring during the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a mns are high fever, stiffness, changing consciousness layers and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and arrhythmia).</seg>

<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedation was larger compared to the after allsome administration of Aripiprazole, in a study where healthy volunteers aripiprazole (15 mg dosage) was used intramuscularly in the healthy subjects and the simultaneously lauazepam (2 mg dosage) were intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically unrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">CYP2D6 'poor' (= "poor") metabolisers can result in a common application with high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole in comparison to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV- protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After setting up the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of Abilify should be lifted to the dose height prior to the start of the companion therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dosage) intramuscular received, the intensity of the sedation was larger compared to that after allsome administration of Aripiprazole.</seg>

<seg id="163">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical trials (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripivzol- Treatment and 13.1% in patients was placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% was reported in patients with regard to aripibozol- treatment and 17.6% for those with lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients with aripibozol treatment and 15.7% for placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripibozol and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters were detected, did not result in medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases in CPK (creatinphosphate kinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripibrazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">Side effects related to antipsychotic therapy, and also reported in the treatment with Aripivzol, include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders was the Aripivzol injection solution with statistically significant significant improvement of aggidity / behavioural disorders associated with placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-time study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as aggidity and behavioural disturbances, the Aripivzol injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms of asgibility and behavioural disturbance compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The observed mean improvement of the baseline on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour final point was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe astringent, a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the total population, but a statistical significance could be determined due to a reduced patient number.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled study 52 the share of responder patients, which kept a response to the study medication, was similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg-Depressionsrates scale, showed a significantly greater improvement than haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a significantly higher return rate, 34% in the Aripibozol- (oral) group and 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Olanzapine-controlled multi-blind study of schizophrenia over 26 weeks that included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 in a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which in some cases did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the adjuvant therapy with Aripiprazole revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study conducted over 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension in manic patients who had achieved a remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilisation phase, Aripipezol was superior to the prevention of a bipolar regression, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">The Aripibozol AUC is in the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection 90% larger the AUC according to the dose of the same dose as tablet; the systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers the mean time was applied to the maximum plasma level in 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The administration of Aripivzol injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated use in systemic exposure (AUC), which were 15 - or 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity after intravenous application, no safety-related concerns after maternal exposure to 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) were beyond the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with aripiprazole (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, gene otoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans; therefore, they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal rinse toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchygia cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase of adrenal rinds in females with 60 mg / kg / day (the 10 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">Moreover, cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites from Aripiprazole in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1 to 3 times the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81-times the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="190">In rabbits, these effects were observed following dosages leading to expositions of the 3 and 11-times of the average steady-state AUC at recommended clinical tolerances.</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, of which about three quarters previously had received an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole administration or as a monotherapy) was compared with the median containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side-effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In total, 72 (31%) of the 229 treated with Abraxane were treated to the treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">If one considers only patients treated for metastatic breast cancer for the first time, there was no difference between the efficacy indicators such as time to the deterioration of the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">In contrast, patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who breastfeed or before the treatment have low neutrophils in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) noted that Abraxane was active in patients with whom the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional paclitaxel and that it does not have to be given with other medicines in contrast to other paclitaxel medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted the Abraxis BioScience Limited licence for the placing of Abraxane in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="292">The following are the most common and major incidents of side effects that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in the pivotal phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most prominent hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversibly and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Listed below are the side effects associated with the administration of Abraxane as monotherapy at each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1.000); very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasional: elevated blood pressure, weight gain, increased liquor hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, flatulence, tongue-burning, dry mouth, pain of gums, loose stools, oesophagitis, pain in the lower abdomen, sores in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the thoracic wall, weakness of the muscles, neck pain, pain in the skeletal musculature, flank pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness Very frequent:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite related case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of actual incidence are possible and no causal connection with these events has been established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimicrobial agent that promotes the pooling of microtubules from the tubules and stabilizes the microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transcytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in-vitro studies has been demonstrated that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of albumin through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60-albuminreeptor and occurs due to the albumin-binding protein SPARC (sected protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumour.</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two unverbalized untreated studies and 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III trial.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was administered in the form of an infusion for over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicentre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer, who received treatment with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with premedication for the prevention of an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a impaired general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had not received chemotherapy before, 27% only had adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastasis and 19% because of metastasis and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First-line therapy are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy Grade 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for decay on baseline because of the cumulative Toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the overall paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute injection of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="316">The active substance exposure (AUC) increased linear from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml, analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After the intravenous dose of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2, the high distribution volume points to a far-reaching extravascularly distribution and / or soft tissue binding of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study involving patients with advanced solid tumours the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel after intravenous 30-minute injection of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane were compared with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane administration (43%) than after a solvent-based paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers is reported that paclitaxel is metabolized primarily to 6α -hydroxypiclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "p-hydroxypiclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30 minutes infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative urine excretion of the unchanged active ingredient was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypiclitaxel and 3 "-p hydroxypaclitaxel, suggesting a far-reaching non-renal clearing.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available about patients at the age of more than 75 years, since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>

<seg id="361">Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and patients who want to make an own blood donation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be done by the patient or his supervisor, provided that they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the haemoglobin values should always be in recommended areas (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are to be monitored before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients who receive chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by anthropoiesis or by the fact that the body does not adequately respond to the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced to enable it to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared with an injection into a Vene as part of a major study involving 479 patients suffering from anemia caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">To all patients participating in this study, Eprex / Erypo had been injected into a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either switched to Abseamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study where the effects of the skin sprayed under the skin were examined with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study involving patients suffering from anemia caused by kidney problems, the haemoglobin values of patients who were converted to Abseamed were maintained to the same degree as those who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the starting value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common adverse event of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, smelling migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this will not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that for Abseamed according to the European Union regulations, evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>

<seg id="381">Anaemia and reduction of transfusion demand in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma who receive chemotherapy and the risk of transfusion due to the general condition (such as cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate anaemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6,2 - 8,1 mmol / l], if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, in case of planned larger surgical procedures, which require a large blood volume rate (4 or more units blood in men).</seg>

<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml, which cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients, in which the haemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease burden; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in haemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual haemoglobin levels can be observed on or under the haemoglobin target concentration in one patient.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this hemoglobin instability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest permitted dosage, which is required for control of anaemia and anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The results of this study suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The results of this study suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week by means of intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anaemia and follow-up may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease burden; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of this hemoglobin instability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest permitted dosage, which is required for control of anaemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of treatment of the haemoglobin value increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the target number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to baseline, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin increased &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the target number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to baseline, the dose should be lifted to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week the haemoglobin value increased by ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the Retikulood number by ≥ 1 g / µl, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">On the other hand, the haemoglobin value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) respectively the target number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the starting value, an approach to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (haematokrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood canned foods is required, Abseamed should be received twice a week prior to the surgical procedure in a dose of 600 I.U. / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="403">With the iron substitution you should start as soon as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the start of the autologous blood donation program - to make large iron reserves available before the beginning of the Abseamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgical procedure and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be given 300 I.U. / kg preoperatively on 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection at the end of dialysis can be given over the hose of a fistula, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure a sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients who are ill with any erythrocytin on erythroblastomia (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive a Abseamed or another erythropoetin (see section 4.4 - erythrocystienia).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis (e.g. anamnestically known venous thromboemboils).</seg>
<seg id="409">The use of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in patients who are unable to participate in an autologous blood donation program: severe coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial occlusion, vascular disease of the carcinoma or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with a recently occurred heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastoma (PRCA) Very rarely was reported about the occurrence of a PRCA medically transmitted after monate- to years of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden effect loss, defined as a reduction in haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the reticulocyte value should be determined and the usual causes of failure (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminiumintoxication, infections or inflammation, blood loss and hemolysis) are investigated.</seg>
<seg id="412">When the reticulocyte value, taking into account anaemia (i.e. the reticuloyte "index"), is lower (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 20,000 / microliter or &lt; 0.5%), the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone-marks should be considered for diagnosis of a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data on immunogenicity for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients with a risk of anti-body induced PRCA (patients with renal anaemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of haemoglobin target concentration in Section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies an increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoiesis stimulant agents (ESA) were given with a haemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit to the ability of epoetines if the haemoglobin concentration is increased by means of the concentration required for controlling anemia symptoms and avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin increase should amount to about 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month in order to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evident coronary heart disease or congestive insufficiency, the upper limit of haemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded in section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia associated with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which is not yet dialysis, does not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In case of tumour patients under chemotherapy, epoetin alfa has to be considered a 2-3 week delay between epoetin alfa and erythropoetin response (patients that may need to be transacted).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is higher than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a b value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapic anemia - dose adjustment with the aim of holding the haemoglobin level between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the patient's involvement, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are intended for a larger elective orthopaedic surgery, if possible, before the beginning of epoetin alfa therapy the cause of anaemia is examined and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who undergo a larger elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be excluded that in treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial haemoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl is an increased risk of post-operative thrombotic / vascular occlusion.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled studies, epoetine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anemia or decrease the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in people with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy was led back if a hemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood level of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosport dose can be adjusted to the rising hematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues there is no evidence of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF regarding hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular events, deep venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients suffering from epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during the treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">An increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients under treatment with erythropods.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoetin treatment it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>
<seg id="434">The technologically acquired epoetin alfa is glycosified and is identical to the amino acids and carbohydrate content identical to endogenous human erythropoetin, which was isolated from the urine of anaemia patients.</seg>

<seg id="568">It is used in patients with a high fracture risk (fractures), including those who recently suffered from a low traumatic fracture like with Hinfallen; • Morbus Paget of the bone, a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth.</seg>
<seg id="569">In addition, patients with Morbus Paget should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after the treatment; patients with hip fracture should receive a large dose of vitamin D (50 000 to 12,000 IE) prior to the first infusion or administered by injection into a muscle.</seg>
<seg id="570">The administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen (remedy against inflammation) shortly after the application of Aclasta can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days following infusion such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headaches.</seg>

<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include: • The package insert • contraindication in pregnancy and lactating women • Required of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, the non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • Can be resorted to medical or nursing assistance</seg>
<seg id="588">Osteoporosis treatment • in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including in patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic fracture fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men an intravenous infusion of 5 mg Aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic fracture correction, the infusion of Aclav is recommended two or more weeks after surgical treatment of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For treatment of the Murbus Paget Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treatment of the Paget with Aclasta, a long remission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, corresponding twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first Aclave infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by offering paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with renal impairment (see section 4.4) In patients with a creatinin clearing &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="597">Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adjustment is not necessary because bioavailability, distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclasta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age since data on harmlessness and efficacy is lacking.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min), since only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokalemia is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before starting treatment (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Because of the rapid onset of the effect of cioledronic acid on bone reconstruction, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia can develop, whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days following the infusion of Aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, corresponding twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids (bad oral hygiene) should be examined prior to using bisphosphonates with appropriate preventive dental treatment.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who require dental surgery, no data is available whether the interruption of the treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteoporosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by offering paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of atrial fibrillation reported as severe adverse events was increased (1,3%) (51%) (51 of 3,862) compared to those receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In the osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]), the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 10), common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), occasional (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 1000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000) adverse drug interactions are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal dysfunction Zoledronic was associated with renal dysfunctions which referred to as a decrease in renal function (i.e. an increase in serum creatine) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The changes in the creatinin-clearing (measured annually before the administration) and the incidence of kidney failure and limited kidney function were comparable in a clinical study of osteoporosis over three years between the anclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum-creatine within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with Aclayxis versus 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the assessment of laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium values, which were below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2.10 mmol / l), occurred at 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical trial compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for postmenopausal osteoporosis, in the study to avoid clinical fractures following a fracture fracture and in the Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures following a recently filed hip fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions After administration of Zoledronic acid in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions to the infusion site such as redness, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteoarthritis in the jaw area was knowingly, especially in cancer patients, about osteoarthritis (primary in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including Zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental surgery.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 study involving 7,736 patients performed osteoneconsis in the jaw area of one with Aclasta and placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="620">In case of overdose which leads to clinically relevant hypokalemia, a compensation can be achieved by giving oral calcium and / or an intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclay5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in postmenopausal women (7,736 women between 65 and 89 years) with either a BMD-T score for the Schenkelhas ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing vertebral fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric spinal fractures Aclasta decreased significantly over a period of three years and already after a year the frequency of one or more new vertebral fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Patients from 75 years of age and older had a risk of reduced risk for vertebral fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta had an equally lasting effect over three years, which resulted in a reduced risk of hip fractures in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density on lumbar vertebra, hip and distal radius compared with placebo treatment significantly at all time points (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the whole hip at 6.0%, the thighs by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology in 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the reservoir.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in trabecular bone volume compared to placebo and received trabecular bone architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propeptide of the type I- collagen (P1NP) in the serum and the beta-C-telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum and the beta-C-telopeptide (b-CTx) were determined in sub-groups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during the study duration.</seg>
<seg id="630">The treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Aclasta reduced BSAP after 12 months significantly reduced by 30% compared to baseline and was held at 28% below the starting value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the baseline for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the starting value after 12 months and was held at 55% below the starting value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks prior to infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">Total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the treated group compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON RFT study, the Aclasta treatment increased the BMD at all points of time compared to placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta treatment conducted more than 24 months in comparison with placebo treatment to increase the BMD by 5.4% in total fragrances and 4.3% at the thigh neck.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON RFT study, 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients the BMD was assessed after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the frequency of clinical fractures was 7.5% compared to 8.7% in placebo-treated men.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (Study CZOL446M2308), the once annual administration of Aclays was not inferior compared to the weekly administration of alendronate in relation to the percentage change of the lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment at Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radiologically verified, especially mild to moderate severe Morbus Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of the alkaline phosphatase corresponding to the 2,6times to 3,0x age-specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg of cioledronate compared to the intake of 30 mg of Risedronate once daily during 2 months was demonstrated in two six-month comparison studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">The combined results showed a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence compared to baseline and Risedronate compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as responder at the end of the six-month study could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From the 143 with Aclasta and the 107 patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response was observed in 141 of patients treated with Risedronate, compared to 71 of those treated with Risedronate, in the mean time of follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Infusion of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of oledronacid in 64 patients resulted in the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma level quickly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biophase disappearance from the large cycle with half-life t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ β 1,87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early part phases (α and β, with the t ½ -values mentioned above) presumably represent the rapid resorption in the bones and excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body-Clearance amounts to 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion-time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the zone acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the area below the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced clearances of metabolized substances which are metabolized by cytochrome P450-enzyme systems is unlikely because Zoledronic acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or even no direct and / or irreversible, hydrogen-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearing of the oledronic acid correlated with the creatinin clearing, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatine clearing, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 examined patients (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in an easy (Clr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal impairment down to a creatinin clearing up to 35 ml / min requiring no dose adjustment of zoledroneic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since severe renal dysfunction (Kreatinin- clearances &lt; 30 ml / min) are only limited data, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-letally active intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and at rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies on dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC the 6fold of recommended human therapeutic exposure) were administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application, renal tolerability of cioledronic acid was given in rats by dosages of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose corresponding to the 7fold of human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use in accumulated expositions that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects were present in other organs, including gastrointestinal tract and liver, and intravenous injection.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common complication in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphysis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with nearly all dosages, a finding that reflects the pharmacological, anti-absorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed teratogenicity in doses from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg due to low serum calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledronacid is a class of substances called bisphosphonate and is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the Paget of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens formed by androgens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">With the Morbus Paget the bone reconstruction takes place too quickly, and new bone material is constructed unordered, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by re-normalizing the bone structure, thereby ensuring normal bone formation and once again gives strength to the bone.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are in dental treatment or undergo dental surgery, tell your doctor that you will be treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">Please inform your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have been taken / applied recently, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Health Evaluation Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). it can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) in which metformin (a diabetic medication) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can also be applied to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), which cannot be adequately adjusted with metformin alone in the highest acceptable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with sulfonyresins or insulin, the previous dose of the sulfonyresine or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the acetone treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of the sulfonyl resins or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sinks, which makes type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of Actos in Tripletherapy was examined; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphonyl alcohol, in addition they received up to 3.5 years either Actos or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a reduction in the HbA1c value, which indicates that the blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg doses.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional dose of Actos for existing treatment with Metformin and a sulphonyl alcohol was 0.94% in HbA1c, while the additional dose of placebo was 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study investigating the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients, patients who took Actos in addition to insulin showed a reduction in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months compared to 0.14% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events related to Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypothesiosis (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, congestive heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients with metformin.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a licence to the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for the placing of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white to whitish, round, vaulted and wear on one side the markings" "" "15" "" "and on the other side the inscription" "" "Actos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood sugar is inadequately adjusted with insulin and where metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For the application of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at least risk-prone due to the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. coronary heart attack or symptomatic coronary artery disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or oedema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports of cardiac insufficiency, which, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver enzyme levels (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT levels are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme levels are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that point to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, upper stomach upset, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme levels are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pioglitazone is continued should be guided by clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters are prevalent.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain has been demonstrated that may touch fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution, corneal haemoglobin (relative reduction by 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred under therapy with pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in similar controlled trials with pioglitazone in patients under Metformin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 3-4% and hematokrits by 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazone as oral two or three-fold combination therapy with a sulfonyrese or dual combination therapy with insulin are the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, it was reported that thiazoldindions, including pioglitazone, were reported, or deterioration of diabetic macular edema with a decrease in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazone and the presence of macular edema, but prescribing doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report about disturbances of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmologic examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events concerning fractures of randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient-years in the women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient-years in women who were treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive trial, a study of over 3.5 years of study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 questionnaires per 100 patient-years), compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient desires a pregnancy or that occurs, the treatment is deprecated (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the interactions have shown that Pioglitazone has no relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or drug dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of pioglitazone by 3-fold.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous use of pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a reduction in the AUC of pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that in the treatment with pioglitazone the hyperinsulin anaemia resulting in pregnancy decreases and increases the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; common &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 1000; rare &gt; 1 / 10000; rare &gt; 1 / 10000; rare &gt; 1 / 10000; rare cases: unknown (not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turgor and refractive index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycemic drugs.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with pioglitazone, ALT ascents above the three-fold upper limit of the normal range were often compared to placebo, but less often than in comparison groups under Metformin or Sulfonyharnstoff.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with advanced macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe cardiac insufficiency was 1.6% higher than placebo if pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, insufficiency was rarely reported under pioglitazone, but more frequently if pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summarizing analysis of adverse events concerning fractures of randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trials was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with pioglitazone and over 7,400 patients in the groups treated with comparators.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive trial running over a period of 3.5 years, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone appears to have an activation of specific atomic receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor-γ) (PPAR-γ)), which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces glucosity production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with pioglitazone versus Gliclazide as a monotherapy has been continued for over two years to investigate the time for the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time of two years after the start of the therapy, blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by pioglitazone at 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate despite three months of optimisation with insulin, were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients with Pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin; a reduction of insulin dose in the group treated with Pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical studies over a year showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinine quotient in comparison with the baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week examination of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, compared to placebo, a reduction in overall plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- Cholesterinspiegel and a slight, however clinically not significantly increased LDL Cholesterinspiegel observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical studies over a period of up to two years, pioglitazone reduced overall plasma glycerides and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or glicladium and increased HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, there was no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol in pioglitazone, whereas values decreased under metformin and glicladium.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks, pioglitazone did not only reduce the triglyceride levels, but also improved the postoperative triglyceride level, both over an effect on triglyceride adsorption and hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive trial, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced advanced macrovascular disease were randomised in groups who received either pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application pioglitazone is quickly resorbed, with the peak concentrations of unmodified pioglitazone in plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, it could be proven that Pioglitazone has no relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics or drug dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">Simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactively labeled pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in fences (55%) and a lesser extent in urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">Mean plasma elimination time of unmodified pioglitazone is 5-6 hours, and the total active metabolites is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">Plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of oral Clearance of the mother's substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys, plasma volume enlarging with hemodilution, anemia and reversible excentric heart hypertrophy occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that in treatment with pioglitazone the hyperinsulinemia resulting in the gestation diminishes and increased insulin resistance of the maternal animal and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urinary bladder was induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP) the treatment with two other thiazoldindions led to an increased frequency of colorectal tumours.</seg>

<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient-years in the women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient-years in women who were treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive trial, a study of over 3.5 years of study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 questionnaires per 100 patient-years), compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin were studied with either Pioglitazone or Gliclazide.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical studies over one year showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinine quotient in comparison with the baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, pioglitazone did not only reduce the triglyceride levels but also improved the postoperative triglyceride level, which has an effect on Tryglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic Tryglicerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study missed the target of its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of overall mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankle, coronary revascularization and rearcularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that with the intake of pioglitazone there are no cardiovascular long-term risks.</seg>

<seg id="884">General diseases and complaints at the administration site - Local hypersensitivity reactions to the injection centre During insulin therapy, local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and haematoma at the injection point) occur.</seg>
<seg id="885">Diseases of the immune system gels - Urticaria, Exanthem Very rare - anaphylactic reactions symptoms of generalized hypersensitivity, including generalized rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal disorders, angioneurotical edema, breathing difficulties, palpitations, low blood pressure, and fainting / unconscious.</seg>
<seg id="886">Hypoglycemia can, however, develop gradually: • Easy hypoglycemias can be treated by the oral supply of glucose and sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have grape sugars, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. • severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a one-weighted helper or by glucose that is given intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect starts within half an hour, the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of split (hydrolysis) locations on the human insulin molecule were considered; none of the metabolites formed by the split is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on conventional research on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, gene otoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data will not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended - after the Actrophane is taken out of the refrigerator - the temperature of the insulin to room temperature (not above 25 ° C) is recommended before it is resuspened according to the manual for the first use.</seg>
<seg id="893">Some patients who showed hypoglycaemic reactions after switching from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different from previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="894">The physician must therefore take into account possible interactions in the therapy and consult his patients according to other medicines taken by them.</seg>

<seg id="1188">Liver disease During Phase 3 clinical studies, slight abnormalities of liver function were observed in patients treated with febuxostat (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before starting Febuxostatase (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylline Zwas no interaction studies conducted at Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO inhibition could lead to an increase in theophylary mirror (a hibition of the metabolisation of theophylline was also reported for other XO inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">In subjects, the simultaneous administration of Febuxostat and naproxen was 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in Febuxostats (CMAx 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical studies, the application of naproxen or other NSAR / cox-2 inhibitors was not related to a clinically significant increase of adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / Hydrochlorthiazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin without requiring a dose adjustment for febuxostat or the other active ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study involving volunteers 120 mg of ADENURIC 1 x daily measured an average 22% increase in the AUC of desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, indicating a possible weak inhibitory effect of febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antazida It could be shown that the simultaneous consumption of an antacid, containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide, retarded the intake of Febuxostat (about 1 hour) and a decrease in the CMAx by 32%, but no significant change in the AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregnancies do not include side effects of Febuxostat on pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborn.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be wary of controlling a vehicle, operating machines or exercising dangerous activities until they can be reasonably sure that ADENORIC does not adversely affect their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported in the overall febuxostat group in the pivotal study of Phase 3 (1,3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years) and in long-term extension studies (1,4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years), although no statistically significant differences were found and no causal relationship with Febuxostat could be detected.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The risk factors identified in these patients were an arterioscleral disease and / or myocardial infarction or a decompensated congestive heart failure in the medical history.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1.000 to &lt; 1 / 100) and rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000) side effects that could occur in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg febuxostat and which were reported in all Febuxostat treatment groups more than once, are listed below.</seg>

<seg id="1204">The events reported during long-term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies (see Table 1).</seg>
<seg id="1205">The following treatment-related events were reported in all Febuxostat treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg in long-term extension studies (up to 4 years with exposure time of &gt; 1,900 patient years), according to the indications occasionally.</seg>
<seg id="1206">The following treatment-related events were either not reported at all in pivotal studies of Phase 3 or with a lower frequency:</seg>

<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in the percentage of recurrence of serum levels in subjects, regardless of their renal function (58% in the group with normal renal function and 55% in the group with severe kidney function disturbances).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum levels ≥ 10 mg / dL 40% of patients (APEX and FACT study) had a serum-acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of study (baseline).</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data of the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that a decrease in the incidence of serum levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l), so that less than 3% of patients in the months 16-24 needed treatment against a replenishment (i.e. more than 97% of patients did not need treatment for a poison).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the spruce node size, which resulted in a complete disappearance of the nodes until month 24 in 54% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH- values (&gt; 5.5 µIE / ml) were observed in patients receiving long-term treatment with Febuxostat (5,0%) and also in patients who received allopurinol (5.8%) in the open long-term extension studies (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy volunteers, the maximum plasma concentrations (CMAx) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) increased doses of 10 mg to 120 mg doses of Febuxostat after administration.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg, an increase in AUC is observed for Febuxostat which is larger than the dosisproportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily, the CMAx amounts to about 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant change was observed in the percentage-reduction in serum-acid concentration, provided this was tested (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>

<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the esophagus, the patient must not lie down until after the first intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">As alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union, the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of ADROVANCE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower (11%) compared to those treated with ADROVANCE (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data showing that the Alendronat dose contained in ADROVANCE is exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, pain of the musculoskeletal system (muscles, bones or joints), constipation, diarrhoea (diarrhea), obstruction (ulcera) of the esophagus, dysphagia (swallowing disorders), irritated abdomen (bloated stomach) as well as acid reoccurring.</seg>

<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE should be swallowed only with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) after the day. • Patients should not chew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of oropharyngeal ulcera.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcus, active gastrointestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastrointestinal tract, except for pyloroplasty, are only given under special care (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions, such as oesophagitis, esophageal Ulzera and ösophageal erosion, rarely followed by esophageal striktures, were reported in patients taking Alendronate (partially this severe and required hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that point to possible esophageal reactions, and patients should be pointed out in case of symptoms of esophageal irritation such as dysphagia, pain in swallowing, or retrocorneal pain or new or worsening heartburn of the medicine and seek medical advice (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe esophageal side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that point to esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical trials with alendronate no increased risk was detected, rare (after market launch) gastric and duodenal ulcera, including some severe and with complications, were reported (see Section 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines may affect the resorption of alendronate when taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore, after taking alendronate, patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other drugs (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not conducted, Alendronat was taken in clinical trials along with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clinically relevant interactions occurring.</seg>

<seg id="1323">In this study, the daily dose of alendronate reduced the occurrence of at least one new vertebral fracture by 47% (Alendra 7.9% versus placebo 15.0%).</seg>
<seg id="1324">Resorption Beared on an intravenous reference dose was the mean oral bioavailability of alendronate in women 0,64% for doses between 5 and 70 mg after nocturnal fasting and two hours before intake of a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Bioavailability decreased accordingly to about 0.46% and 0.39% when alendronate was taken half an hour before a standardised breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1326">In osteoporosis studies Alendronate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day.</seg>
<seg id="1327">In healthy volunteers the administration of oral prednisone (20 mg three times a day for five days) led to no clinically significant change in the oral bioavailability of alendronate (increase in the range of 20% to 44%).</seg>
<seg id="1328">9. distribution studies on rats have shown that Alendronate is temporarily distributed in soft tissue after intravenous administration of 1 mg / kg, but then quickly dispersed into the bones or excreted with urine.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Excretion After intravenous administration of a single dose of 14C-Alendronate, about 50% of the radioactive substance was excreted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radioactivity was found in the fences.</seg>
<seg id="1330">After intravenous administration of a single dose of 10 mg, the renal clearing of Alendronat 71 ml / min and systemic clearing exceeded 200 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="1331">In rats, Alendronate does not excrease the acid or alkaline transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the excretion of other medicines by these transport systems.</seg>

<seg id="1335">Excretion In the administration of radioactively labeled Vitamin D3 to healthy subjects, the mean excretion of radioactivity in urine after 48 hours 2.4%, in the fences after 4 days 4.9%.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Characteristics in patients with preclinical studies have shown that the proportion of alendronate, which is not deposited in the bone, is quickly excreted through the urine.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Although no clinical data is available, it is nonetheless expected that the renal elimination of alendronate as in animal tests will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Therefore in patients with reduced kidney function, an increased risk of alendronate in bones can be expected (see section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of Tacrolimus, this may result in graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects including under- or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dose; provisions of the formulation or regime should be carried out only under close-meshed control of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Section4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a switch to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dose adaptations must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The recommended dosage should be based primarily on clinical evaluation of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood level measurements (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advance, the Tacrolimus levels should be checked before conversion and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>

<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of the Tacrolimus levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advance to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post-transplantation phase.</seg>

<seg id="1424">Recommended Dosage - conversion from Prograf to Advantf must be converted a transplant recipient of twice daily dose of Prograf capsules on a once daily intake of Prograf capsules, so this conversion has to be done in ratio 1: 1 (mg: mg), in relation to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplantation After switching from other immunosuppressants to Advance once a day, the treatment with the oral and liver transplant recommended for prophylaxis of graft rejection must begin.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplantation In adult patients who are converted to Advance, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once a day.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients Obprobably there is no clinical experience with antisplant, pankcreatic and intestinal transplanted patients, in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, in case of pankreast-transplanted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and for bowel transplant recipients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adaptations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function For the maintenance of blood glucose levels in the targeted area, a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver function disturbances.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function has no influence on the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of serum creatine levels, a calculation of the creatine levels and a monitoring of the volume of urine) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Switching from Ciclosporin to Advance When switching from a Ciclosporto to a Tacrolimus-based therapy is recommended (see Section4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations on the valley level in thoroughbred The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases with the aid of thoroughbred-tacrolimus-mirror checks.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent controls of tacrolimus dorsal during the first two weeks after transplantation followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">The blood-level mirror of Tacrolimus should also be controlled after switching from Prograf to Advance, Dosismodiung, Changes in immunosuppressive therapy or while applying substances that could change the Tacrolimus whole blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Adventif is a medicine with a low clearing, adjustments of the dose may require several days before the Steady State has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the level of sebum in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the levels of Tacrolimus in thoroughbred in the first time after liver transplantation are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including transplant rejection or other side effects, which may occur as a result of tacrolimus in under- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dose; provisions of the formulation or regime should be carried out only under close-meshed control of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Section4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be resistant to other immunosuppressants, there are no clinical data for the retarded formulation Advance.</seg>
<seg id="1442">In addition to prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and transplant recipients in childhood, no clinical data for the retarded formulation advocacy are still available.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the Tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may be used, or other herbal remedies during a treatment with Advance (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is offered, because the Tacrolimus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, under Prograf, a coronary or septum hypertrophy referred to as cardiomyopathy was observed, which can therefore occur under the law.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are an already existing heart condition, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disturbances, infections, fluid overloading and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of maligner skin lesions due to appropriate clothing or use of a sun protective device with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who take Tacrolimus, symptoms for PRES such as headaches, altered state of consciousness, cramps and visual disturbances, should be a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>

<seg id="1450">Simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can influence the metabolism of tacrolimus and therefore increase or decrease the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels with concurrent application of substances that can alter the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintain uniform concentrations (see Section4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly pronounced interaction was associated with antimycotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole as well as with the Macrolid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z).</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetics showed that the increase in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, caused by the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">High-dose prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus can be metabolized with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4 whose metabolism impairs.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since tacrolimus can reduce the Clearance of steroid-contraceptives so that hormonal expositions can increase, decisions on contraceptive measures are particularly cautious.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that tacrolimus could potentially reduce the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and prolong their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a low number of studies on transplant patients do not indicate that under Tacrolimus compared to other immunosuppressants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="1469">Action mechanism and pharmacodynamic effects On the molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus are likely to be mediated by binding to a cytosolish protein (FKBP12) that is responsible for enriching the connection in the cellular nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent inhibiting of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents the transcription of a certain number of lymphocytes genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T-helper cells, further the formation of lymphocytes (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) as well as the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>

<seg id="1481">175 people transplanted patients, 475 patients who underwent a pancreas transplant and in 630 cases were used as the primary immunosuppressant in 630 cases.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral Prograf was consistent in these published studies in the large studies where Prograf was used for primary immunosuppression in liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted, multicentre study with oral Prograf was reported about 110 patients who received either tacrolimus or ciclosporin as part of a 1: 1 randomisation.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic transplant rejection, bronchiolitis obliteral syndrome, was observed less frequently in the first year after the transplant (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after a year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus- and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Trek et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with Tacrolimus, it was in 21,7% of cases of the origin of a bronchiolitis of obliterans compared to 38.0% under Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases in which Ciclosporin had to be changed to tacrolimus was significantly larger (p = 0.02) as the number of patients treated by Tacrolimus on Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute graft rejection was higher after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the treatment transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus Group (Trek et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study, the incidence of a bronchiolitis of obliteral syndroms in the patients treated with Tacrolimus was significantly lower.</seg>
<seg id="1490">A multicentre study with oral Prograf was performed to 205 patients who underwent pancreatic and kidney transplantation at the same time, who received Tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102) after a randomised trial.</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initial dose (by protocol) of Tacrolimus was 0,2 mg / kg / day and was then obtained for the desired talent levels from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The published clinical results of a monocentric clinical trial with oral Prograf as the primary immunosuppressant following intestinal transplants showed an up-to-date survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrats and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the unbound group of tacrolimus, or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with corticosteroids, should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized prior to excretion, and excretion is mainly done through bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was approximately 10% lower compared to Prograf in cases of stable patients (twice a day) in relation to 1: 1 (mg: mg) in relation to the total daily dose.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advances is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (a congenital heart defect caused by the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether Advances are used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A are suffering from a factor VIII deficiency which causes blood clots such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but is produced according to a method called recombinant DNA technology:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced to enable it to form the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advances is similar to another in the European Union called Recombinate, but is manufactured in a different way so that the medicine does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study involving 53 children under six years, the use of the drug for preventing bleeding and surgical procedures was investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of Advances in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood sepals with "excellent" or "good" was assessed.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advances (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexie (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advances may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission issued a licence to the company Baxter AG for the placing of lawyers in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, on the site and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events the factor VIII activity should not fall under the specified plasma levels (in% of the standard or in I.U. / dl) during the corresponding period.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years), until the risk of the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the course of treatment it is recommended to control the dose and frequency of injections to be appropriate to determine the factor VIII plasma level.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and have different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight within 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma is not achieved or if bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose, a test must be performed to prove an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors, it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The rate of administration should depend on the patient's condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of antibodies against factor VIII is a known complication in treating patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII directed IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma by means of modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, where the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure and anamnestic well-known inhibitor development, recombinant Factor VIII-product was observed on another, the reoccurrence of (low-trigen) inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs contained in the largest number of patients were inhibitors to factor VIII (5 patients), which showed a higher risk of the formation of inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000), very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the total of the individual patients (234). the unexpected drop in the blood coagulation factor VIII-Spiegels was performed postoperatively (10 - 14 postoperative day) in a patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">The blood clotting was maintained throughout the period and the factor VIII- Spiegel in the plasma as well as the Clearance rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials involving ADVATE on 145 children and adults 2 with cases of severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrate (≥ 150 days), only one patient after 26 Expositions with ADVATE showed a low inhibitory (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach).</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, a FVIII inhibitor was observed in none of the 53 paediatric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) after previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days).</seg>
<seg id="1562">Previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical study were 5 of 25 (20%) treated with ADVATE against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The patient's immune response to traces of contaminating proteins was analyzed by investigating the antibody titers against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed a statistically significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of antibody levels against anti-CHO cell protein; however, there were no signs or symptoms indicative of an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Four patients were interviewed on the occurrence of urticaria, conuritus, rash and increased number of eosinophiles granuloytes in several repeated product expositions within the study.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP has continued to evaluate the benefit risk assessment as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of ADVATE, which requires a filing of PSURs every 6 months, that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited distributed the Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in December 2008 that the company will withdraw its application for approval for the issuance of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissues that connects, surrounds and supports other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "the virus in Advexin is a" "" "Adenovirus" "", "which has been modified to produce no copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin could have injected directly into the tumors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is formed by the p53 gene from the human body, usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">With Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient, where Li-Fraumeni cancer appeared in the area of the underbelly, in the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP checked the answers of the company to the questions asked him, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the initial documents submitted, the CHMP generates a list of questions sent to the company by day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP opinion, it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni tumors benefits the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is not harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not inform the CHMP about whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or "Compassionate Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "modified active ingredient" "" "means that the tablets are so composite that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, caused by an allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucosal swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents aged 12 and over, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (blocked nose), are cluttered.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended, because the effects of the drug may be reduced to constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measures were the changes in the severity of hay fever symptoms which were reported by the patients before the onset of treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and assessed with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the constipation of the nose, the patients reported to the aerosaze reported a decrease in the symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in the patients who took pseudoephedrine on their own.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients showed a relief of the symptoms at 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who received the disease alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chase), dizziness, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (drowsiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, to adrenergic agents or Loratadin (another medicine for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma (elevated intraocular pressure), urine retention (high blood pressure), hyperthyroidism (hyperthyrosis), hyperthyroidism (cerebral haemorrhage) or have a risk of haemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a approval to the company SP Europe for the launching of Aerinaze in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but it is swallowed whole (i.e. without tearing or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see section 5.1), aerinaze should not be applied to children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, since the activity of pseudoephedrine can decrease over time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, treatment can be continued with desloratadin as a monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze contains Pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or within the 2 weeks after completion of such a therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity in combined application of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, Pergoeyelid, Dihydroergotamine or other deongestiva, which can be used peroral or nasal as a sponge of Rhinology (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, Oxymetazoline, Naphaznavies, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient population and the data is not sufficient to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, abnormal heart rhythms, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a strengthening of the headaches) must be disposed of.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Treatment of the following patient groups is advised: • Patients with digitalis • Patients with cardiac arrhythmia • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck and bronchospasm in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze must be deprecated at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, since antihistamines are otherwise able to prevent or reduce positive reactions for skin reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1679">However, in clinical trials involving desloratadin in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered, no clinically relevant interactions or changes of the plasma concentration of desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor tests, no significant differences could be observed between the patients treated with either desloratadin and placebo-treated patients regardless of whether desloratadin was alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the Lloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines can not be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the application of aero during pregnancy is not assured, experience from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals do not always be transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be applied during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to a dizziness, which may result in impaired mobility or ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyansis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible lettering.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, aggravating muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, breathing insufficiency, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, perspiration, nausea, vomiting, precordiale pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, vision disorders and hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is most likely in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (mouth dry, pupil rigidity and - dilatation, skin comfort, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophils as well as inhibition of expression of the adhesion molecule P-seltin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Deschlatadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance, including the strengthening of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, the recommended dose of 5 mg daily did not detect increased drowsiness frequency compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in recommended dosage can cause other sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged 12 to 78 have participated with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine-antagonistic efficacy of Aerinaze tablets was significantly higher compared to the total scores for the symptoms (except nasal mucosal swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine during the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by nasal mucosal swelling, was significantly higher than in monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">In terms of gender, age or ethnicity, the efficacy of Aerinaze tablets did not show any significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy subjects over 14 days, the flow balance of desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects of desloratadin were poorly metabolised.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole administration of pseudoephedrine bioaquivalent was in exposure to the gift of an Aerobaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional safety harmacology studies, toxicity in repeated doses, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, however, the preclinical data with desloratadin cannot detect any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive-toxicological studies the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Tell your doctor if you can experience or diagnose following symptoms or diseases in the application of Aerinaze: • Blood pressure • pacing, palpitations, heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headaches, or strengthening of existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or have taken it recently, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1711">For use in recommended dosage, it is not to be expected that aerinaze leads to dizziness or lowers attention.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Lloratadin very rarely was reported about cases of severe allergic reactions (breathing difficulties, whistling noise, itching, hives, swelling) or skin rashes.</seg>
<seg id="1718">About cases of palpitations, heart chasing, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, sleeping disturbances, muscle pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, over cases of liver inflammation and about cases of showy liver values was also very rare reported.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg- lyophiisat for intake (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg / ml syrup (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and 0.5 mg / ml solution.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged 1 to 5, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day, in the form of 2.5 ml syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies in patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Efficacy was measured by determining the change in symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadrants, impairment of sleep and performance in the day) before and after 6 weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been presented to prove that the body utilizes the syrup, the solution to the intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius led to an average decrease in the symptom scores (symptom scores) by 25 to 32% compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies at Urtikaria, the decrease in the symptom scores was after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared to 40 and 33% in the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, lauatadin or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission issued a licence to the company SP Europe for the issuance of Aerius throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or no meal, to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies to effectiveness in the application of desloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be done according to the current disease progression and can be terminated after the symptoms have gone down and can be resumed when reoccurring.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In case of persistent allergic rhinitis (manifestations of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks), the patient can be recommended for continuous treatment during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical trials of the Lloratadin tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to dizziness, which may result in impaired mobility or ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">Clinical trials in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported more often than placebo were tiredness (1.2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study involving 578 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, the most common adverse event was headaches, which occurred at 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadin and 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study, which was administered up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine times a clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophils as well as inhibiting the expression of the adhesion molecule P-seltin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">As part of a clinical study with multiple doses given at a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in which desloratadin was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily (nine times the clinical dose) was administered over ten days, no extension of the Qtc interval occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Deschlatadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance, including the strengthening of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal drainage and reddening of eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may also be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persisting allergic rhinitis depending on the duration of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the overall live scores of the questionnaire for the quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria has been investigated for further forms of the Urticaria, since the underlying pathophysiology is similar to different forms, and chronic patients can be easily recruited prospectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histaminfection is a causative factor in all the urticular diseases, it is expected that in addition to chronic idiopathic urticaria, desloratadin will also lead to an improvement in the symptoms in other forms of the urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving Pruritus and the reduction of size and number of quadrants at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronically idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement of the itch to more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with chloramines compared to 19% of those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius significantly reduced the disturbance of sleep and wakefulness, as measured by a 4-point scale to evaluate these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study in which the patient-demographics were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients achieved a higher concentration of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications for clinically relevant cumulation after daily use of loratadin (5- 20 mg) for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the Lloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines are not entirely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies carried out with laureadin and Loratadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxicity profile of Desloratadin and Loratadin in a comparable degree of exposure to desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional trials on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated doses, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadin cannot detect any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Coloured film (contains lactose monohydrate, hypromless, titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, Indigo carmin (E 132)), colourless film (contains hypromless, Macrogol 400), carnauba wax, light wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals, to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under the age of 2 are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that no data is available which support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomic anomalies, anamnesis, physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. officially announced the Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company will withdraw its application for Aflunov's permission to prevent influenza in adults and older people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears, which can easily be spread by humans to humans, because humans have no immunity (no protection) on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administering the vaccine, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as "foreign body" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is later able to produce faster antibodies when it comes to contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane cover of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which detects the human body as a body), was cleaned and used as part of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of the clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for prepandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you participate in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment, please contact your attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you wish further information on the basis of CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years, which are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution for intake, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir as the safety of this combination was not investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Asgenera should only be prescribed when the doctor has examined which antiviral drugs the patient has taken before, and the likelihood of the virus is to be addressed to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice a day, which are taken together with 100 mg of Ritonavir and other antiviral drugs twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between the ages of four and twelve, and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Aries is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, Agenerase reduces the HIV-amount in the blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS must not heal but can delay the damage to the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases connected with AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenera was studied in combination with other anti-viral drugs, but without Ritonavir, in two major studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The drug Agenerase, which was used with low doses of Ritonavir, was compared to other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who had previously taken protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors, after 48 weeks under Agenera, more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than placebo, but Agenera was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also decreased the viral load, but only very few were treated by the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study of adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the drug Agenerase increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment just as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which had been resistant to four other protease inhibitors, there was a greater decrease of the viral load after four weeks compared with Ritonavir compared to the patients who received their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), flatulence (flatulence), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Aries may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenase may also not be used in patients who use St. John's wort (a herbal supplement to treat depression) or medicines which are degraded as well as aggenerase and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who take Agenerase are the risk of lipoystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteoarthritis (death of bone tissue) or immune reactivation syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The CHMP Committee concluded that the advantages of Agenerase in combination with other anti-retroviral drugs used to treat HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years compared with the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee found that the benefit of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenase was originally approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "since only limited information was available for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a licence to the company Glaxo Group Limited for the issuance of Ageneralize in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) -pre-treated adults and children aged 4 and over.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually Agenerase capsules should be administered to pharmacokinetic boosters of Amprenavir along with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and pre-treatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than from Amprenavir as a capsule; therefore Agenerase capsules and solution for intake on a milligram per milligram base are not exchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules amounts to 600 mg of amprenavir twice a day with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the addition of ritonavir (boosters), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) need to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules amounts to 20 mg of Amprenavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Agenase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not investigated in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to lack of data on safety and efficacy (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day in adult patients with moderate liver function disorders twice a day and in patients with severe liver function disturbances to 300 mg twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous use should be done with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver function disorder, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Asgenerase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrome P450 Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of Amprenavir during the intake of Amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be informed that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including antibiotic treatment, does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal disease progression.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with existing hepatic function, including chronic-active hepatitis, show an increased frequency of liver function disorders under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored in accordance with clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Agenerase and Ritonavir with Fluticasone or other glucocosteroids that are metabolised via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroidal effects including Morbus Cushing and suppressing the adrenal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is highly dependent on CYP3A4, an concurrent administration of Agenerase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including rhubarb olysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under the supervision of the International Regised Ratio), methods for determining the drug concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who take these medicines at the same time, Agenerase may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of Amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, however the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with amprenavir, the patients should be monitored for the symptoms of opium withdrawal, especially if there are also low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propropylene glycol content of the Agenerase solution, this dosage form is contraindicated in children under an age of four and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenera should be reduced to 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients receiving an antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported about the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exazerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases where medication was required to be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with drug dependent factors, such as prolonged anti-retroviral treatment and related metabolic disorders associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Haemophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors are reports of an increase of haemorrhages including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and haemarthrosis.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections resulting in severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial eology is accepted (including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) were reported.</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrome P450 Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 Substrate with low therapeutic beam Agenerase with Ritonavir may not be combined with drugs whose active ingredients are mainly metabolised via CYP2D6 and are associated with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin caused a 82% reduction in the AUC of amprenavir which can lead to a virological failure and a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the degraded plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, very often adverse effects on the liver have been observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Amprenavir can be reduced by simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes St. John's wort, the amprenavirents are and, if possible, to check the viral load and remove the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if Nelfinavir is administered together with Amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increase, for CMAx, by contrast, reduced by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Amprenavir Capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical studies doses of 600 mg of amprenavir were used twice a day and Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day, which prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% reduction if Amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amprenavir in the plasma, which were achieved by the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with caletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, but a close-meshed monitoring is recommended, as the effectiveness and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study was carried out in combination with didanosine in combination with didanosine, however, due to the antazidis component of didanosine it is recommended that the revenues of didanosin and Agenera are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, with the gift of Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure to both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapin possibly lowers the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, care must be taken as delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub-therapeutic plasmastics.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Caution is advised if these drugs are used together; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring is to be made, as accurate prediction of the effect of the combination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) of Rifabutin by 193%, resulting in a rise in side effects associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction in the dose of Rifabutin is recommended at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is present.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with azithromycin combined with erythromycin were not performed, but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in case of concurrent administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous use of twice a day 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg ketoconazole once daily led to an increase of the CMAx of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to 2.69times compared to the value observed once daily without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, can potentially lead to interactions with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that antacids do not be taken at the same time as Agenerase as it may result in resorption disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulants known as enzymes (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma level of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum levels of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipin, diltiazem, riodipine, Isradipin, nifedipine, nimodipine, nifedipine, and Verapamil can be increased by Amprenavir, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous consumption with Agenerase can considerably increase the plasma concentrations and intensify with PDE5 inhibitors related side effects including hypotension, vision disturbances and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir was given 100 mg capsules twice a day along with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times a day) over 7 days of test subjects, the endogenous cortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% -interval between 82 and 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous application of Agenerase with Ritonavir is not recommended along with these glucocosteroids, unless the possible benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroidal effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">In the case of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is highly dependent on CYP3A4, strong increases in plasma levels should be expected at the same time administering Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma-level increases of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy including a rhubarb olysis, the combined use of these medicines is not recommended with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">The plasma concentrations of Cyclosporine, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased in the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Ageneralize may not be used together with orally taken Midazolam (see Section 4.3), while the use of agenera with parenteral midazolam is advised.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for the simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors point to a possible increase in the plasma level of Midazolam around 3 to 4-barrels.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with Amprenavir, the patients should be monitored for symptoms of opium withdrawal, especially if also low doses of Ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can be given at the moment how the amprenavir dose is adjusted if Amprenavir is administered simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In the simultaneous application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase a greater control of the INR (International Regised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional dose of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore alternative methods for contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended with the concurrent gift of Agenerase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this drug may only be used after careful weighing of the possible benefit for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk of lactating rats, amprenavir-related substances have been proven, but it is not known whether amprenavir passes into breast milk in people.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproductive-study of pregnant rats, administered by the incisiation in the uterus until the end of the breastfeeding time of Amprenavir, showed a decreased increase in 12 body weight during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of the seed, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not affected by the administration of Amprenavir to the mother animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of Agenase has been studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, occurred early and rarely led to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not been clarified whether they are related to taking Agenerase or another medicine used at the same time, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below come from two clinical studies (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which protease inhibitors were not treated with pre-treated patients 1200 mg Agenerase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4) assessed by the investigators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1% of patients, as well as laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4) are performed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a redistribution of body fat (lipoystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and bilateral fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fatty tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsocerebral fat accumulation (Stiernacken).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral non-treated persons treated with amprenavir in combination with Lamivudin / Zidovudine for a mean time of 36 weeks, only one case (bull attacks) was observed (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 patients under amprenavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under incdinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over a mean time of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or makulopapulous nature, with or without itching and occurred spontaneously during the second week of treatment and vanished spontaneously within two weeks without having to stop the treatment with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Osteoarthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In the case of HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">The type and frequency of adverse events (Grade 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4) were observed very frequently in patients who received Agenerase together with low-dose Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdosage, the patient is to be observed on signs of intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, necessary supporting measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the processing of viral galag- and gag-pole- polyprotein levels with the result of a formation of unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was examined both in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% inhibiconcentration (IC50) of Amprenavir is from 0.012 to 0.08 µM in infected cells and is 0,41 µM in chronically infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The relationship between the activity of Amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral previously untreated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages, as with other Ritonavir treatment schemas with protease inhibitors, the mutations described are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen out of 434 anti-retroviral patients who received 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg of Ritonavir twice a day in the ESS100732 trial, a virological failure occurred by week 48, with 14 isolates being genotypically evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of the Isolate of 13 out of 14 children, where a virological failure occurred within the 59, treated with protease inhibitors, showed a resistance pattern similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M36I, I50V, I5V, D60E, I62V, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg Fosamprenavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) with protease inhibitors, patients with virological failure occurred over 96 weeks following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I62V, I5V, I5V, I82A / C / F / S, I84V, and L90M in combination with an increased phenotypic resistance to Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir as well as a reduced likelihood of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic resistance tests based on clinically validated phenotypic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with genotypic data to estimate the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically phenotypic cut-offs (isolation points) for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with decreased sensitivity to amprenavir associated genetic samples causes a certain cross resistance to Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross-resistance between Amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance pathways, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretroviral non-treated patients, in which a Fosamprenavir (one of them demonstrated resistance to Lopinavir and saquinavir at the beginning of treatment and another against Tidenavir), the inhibitor / ritonavir (three out of 25 isolates), indinavir / ritonavir (three out of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tidenavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, Amprenavir retains its activity against some other protease inhibitor-resistant insulates; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Premature termination of a prescribed therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mutations which may adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study, in which PI pretreated adults were treated with Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and Nuclear-care (standard of care, SOC) with PI, mainly with low-dose Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTIs were included in the A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis demonstrated the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in the viral load (HIV-1-RNA) in the viral load (HIV-1-RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-slip threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unborn Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled trials involving 288 HIV-infected children at the age of 2 to 18, of which 152 were pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies Agenerative solution for taking and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low dose Ritonavir was given at the same time; the majority of patients with PI previously had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks approximately 25% of patients included in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml with a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on this data, the expected benefits of" "" "unbleached" "" "Agenerase should be considered when optimizing treatment with PI pretreated children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">According to oral administration, the average duration (tmax) up to the maximum serum concentration of amprenavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">By contrast, 508% increased, by contrast to CMAx by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease of the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosing (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the intake of food, although the simultaneous dietary intake affects the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an unimpeded penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, whereby the amount of unbound amprenavir, which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active ingredient fluctuates during dosing intervals depending on the total drug concentration in the Steady State via the range of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 must be administered cautiously if they are given at the same time with Agenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily amprenavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is from the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore Agenerase solution and Agenerase capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram base.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also, the renal clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the effect of renal dysfunctions on the elimination of amprenavir and ritonavir is likely to be low.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemata lead to amprenavir plasma reflection comparable to those obtained in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Amprenavir twice a day without the simultaneous dose of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies of carcinogenicity with amprenavir on mice and rats occurred hepatellular adenomas in male animals, which corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8- times (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been elucidated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, from the present exposure data in humans, both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application, there was little evidence for the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo- and in-vitro gene expression tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames test), mouse-lymphom test, microkernel test on rats and chromosomal aberration tests on human peripheral lymphocytes included, Amprenavir was neither mutagen or genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">No significant liver toxicity in patients has been observed in clinical trials, neither during the administration of Agenerase after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on the toxicity of young animals, which were treated at an age of 4 days, showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In systemic plasma exposure, which was significantly lower (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than expected exposure under therapeutic dose in humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus ongation and minor skeletal changes were observed that point to a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the addition of ritonavir (boosters), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) need to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules amounts to 20 mg of Amprenavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous application should be done with care in patients with weak or mild liver function problems, in patients with severe liver function disorder, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under the supervision of the International Regised Ratio), methods for determining the drug concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Agenera should be dismissed in duration 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2068">An increased risk of lipoystrophy was associated with individual factors, such as higher age, and drug related factors, such as prolonged anti-retroviral treatment and related metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2069">It was shown that Rifampicin caused a 82% reduction in the AUC of amprenavir which can lead to a virological failure and a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="2070">508% increase, for CMAx, by contrast, reduced by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Amprenavir Capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of Amprenavir in the plasma, which were achieved by the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with caletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, but a close-meshed monitoring is recommended, as the effectiveness and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure to both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Caution is advised if these drugs are used together; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring is to be made, as accurate prediction of the effect of the combination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction of Rifabutin dosage is recommended at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is present.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Serum levels of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipin, diltiazem, riodipine, Isradipin, nifedipine, nimodipine, nifedipine and verapamil can be increased by amprenavir which may increase the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir was given 100 mg capsules twice a day along with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times a day) over 7 days of test subjects, the endogenous cortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% -interval between 82 and 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">In the simultaneous application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase a greater control of the INR (International Regised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0,035 mg Ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg of Norethindron) led to a decrease in the AUC and Cmin by Amprenavir by 22% respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2080">During pregnancy, this drug may only be used after careful weighing of the possible benefit for the mother compared to possible risks to the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2081">A reproductive-study of pregnant rats, which was administered by the incisiation in the uterus until the end of the breastfeeding time of Amprenavir, showed a decreased increase in body weight during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2082">The harmlessness of Agenase has been studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2083">In case of overdosage, the patient is to be observed on signs of intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, necessary supporting measures.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was examined both in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% inhibiconcentration (IC50) of Amprenavir is from 0.012 to 0.08 µM in infected cells and is 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">Conversely, Amprenavir retains its activity against some other protease inhibitor-resistant insulates; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on this data, the expected benefits of "unbleached" Agenerase should be considered when optimizing treatment with PI pretreated children.</seg>
<seg id="2088">While the absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active ingredient fluctuates during dosing intervals depending on the total drug concentration in the Steady State via the range of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 must be administered cautiously if they are given at the same time with Agenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2090">Also, the renal clearing of Ritonavir is negligible; therefore, the effect of renal dysfunctions should be low on the elimination of amprenavir and ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2091">In long-term studies of carcinogenicity with amprenavir on mice and rats, hepatellular adenomas occurred in male animals, which corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8- times (rat) of exposure to humans after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The underlying mechanism for the genesis of hepatocele adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been elucidated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>

<seg id="2099">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than from Amprenavir as a capsule; therefore Agenerase capsules and solution for intake on a milligram per milligram base are not exchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2100">Patients should, once they are able to swallow the capsules, stop taking the solution to inhale (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2101">The recommended dose for Agenera solution amounts to 17 mg (1.1 ml) amprenavir / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2800 mg of amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2102">In addition, since no dose recommendation can be given for the simultaneous application of Agenerase solution for intake and low dose Ritonavir, this combination can be avoided in these patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Although a dose adjustment for Amprenavir is not deemed necessary, an Agenerase solution for taking patients with kidney failure is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2104">Due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high propylglycol content, Agenerase is a solution for taking infants and children under 4 years of age, in pregnant women, in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2105">Simultaneous administration can lead to a competitive inhibition of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life-threatening side effects such as cardiac arrhythmias (z).</seg>

<seg id="2212">Among the most commonly reported and possibly or possibly with the application of Imiquimodine-cream related side effects include discomfort at the application location with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The basalioma patients treated by 185 with Imiquimodine-cream from a placebo-controlled phase III clinical study reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common, as likely or possibly with the application of the Imiquimodine-cream related side effect, were in these studies a response to the application location (22% of patients treated with Imiquimodine).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects that were specified by 252 in placebo-controlled clinical studies of Phase III with Imiquimodine-cream treated patients with actinic keratosis are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">This clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials involving three times weekly treatment with Imiquimodine cream frequently led to local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), exfoliation / abscaling (23%) and edema (14%) (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">This review, according to the study plan, shows that in these studies, with five times weekly treatment with Imiquimodine-cream, it often resulted in severe erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%), and severe scaling (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical studies investigating the use of immiquimodine for the treatment of actinic keratosis, alopecia was detected with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">A unique oral intake of 200 mg Imiquimodine, which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headaches, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically severe side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, was hypotony normalized after oral or intravenous fluids.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic investigation, systemic concentrations of the alpha-interferons and other cytokines were detected in the topical application of Imiquimine.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies, efficacy in relation to complete eradication of cowwarts in Imiquimodine treatment was significantly superior over 16 weeks of placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2223">In 60% of patients who had been treated with Imiquimodine, the Feignices healed completely; this was the case with 20% of the patients who had been treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 with Imiquimine treated male patients, compared to 5% of 161 with placebo treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>

<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically verified individual primary supercardial cell carcinoma with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data available from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically cured and that remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Imiquimodine's efficacy in three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week treatment-free period, was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>

<seg id="2232">Aldara cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials involving children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimodine n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The effectiveness of Imiquimodine could not be shown in these studies in the doses investigated there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or.</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimum systemic absorption of the 5% Imiquimodine-cream by the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratinosis was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest concentrations of drugs in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and dormant 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated half-life time was about 10 times higher than the two-hour half-life after the subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data for systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimodine after topical application to MC-diseased skin of patients aged 6 to 12 was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with actinic keratosis or superinfected basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study of dermal toxicity in rats, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg G led to significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study carried out for the dermal application for four months resulted in no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on the carcinogenicity in mice in three days a week did not induce tumours on the application site.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but because Imiquimodine has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagen, a risk for humans is regarded as very low due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active free cream, earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyms is used for enzyme therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (symptoms which are not related to brain or nerve).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not degraded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, complicating movements, decreased lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyms should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyms should take place in a hospital or clinic with revitational devices, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study was mainly examined by the safety of the drug, but it was also measured (by examining its effect on reducing GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the liver's size).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five Aldurazyms reduced the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the children treated showed a normal big liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyms in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat-feeling, fever and reactions at the infusion site.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under the age of five are elevated blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurable size of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyms may not be used in patients who may be highly hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>

<seg id="2286">Aldurazyms is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with a diagnosis of a Mucopysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyms should be done by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries this, every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyms in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyms in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with durazyms can develop infusion-related reactions defined as any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored, and the infusion of Aldurazyms should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which revitational facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, we expect nearly all patients to form IgG antibodies against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibody or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with care when using Aldurazyms (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Because there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer period of time, the risk of hypersensitivity reactions after an interruption of the treatment must be cautiously avoided due to the risk of hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before starting infusion with medication (antihistamines and / or anti-pyrolka) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a mild or moderate infusion reaction, the treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be induced and / or a reduction of infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction in infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 are (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyms should not be used simultaneously with chloroquine or procaine because there is a potential risk of interference with the intracellular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there are no data exposed to newborns exposed to larvae of breast milk, it is recommended to breastfeed with Aldurazyme during treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The side effects in clinical studies were predominantly classified as infusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in the phase 3 study (duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyms, which were observed during the phase 3 study and their extension with a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years, are listed in the following table according to the following frequency: very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre-history, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, breathing silence and facial edema (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug interactions in connection with Aldurazyms, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients under 5 years of age, with predominantly severe follow-up and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients, a seroconversion occurred within 3 months after the onset of the treatment, mostly within one month with a severe follow-up procedure (average after 26 days versus 45 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (or until an early departure from the study), 13 / 45 patients showed no detectable antibodies in 13 / 45 patients, including 3 patients with which it has never occurred to SeroconVersion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the GAG mirror in urine, whereas in patients with high antibody titers a variable reduction of GAG in urine was detected.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low-neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic Laronidase- activity in vitro, which did not seem to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions although the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The rationale for the enzyme therapy is one of the hydrolysis of the accumulated medium and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the circulation and taken from cells into the lysosomes, most likely about mannose-6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyms were studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study that showed the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients were from the middle phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open-label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyms for another 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, the patients treated with Aldurazyms showed an improvement in lung function and capacity to be treated in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FEV has not been clinically significant over this period and the total lung volumes increased proportionally to the body's size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hysterectomy before treatment 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a significant drop in the GAG mirror was found in the urine (µg / mg Kreatinin), which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Overall improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening of 9 patients (20%) was generally observed in 26 patients (58%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyms were studied in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age (16 patients with severe form of follow-up and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased Gag- levels in the urine in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were determined by the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe follow-up form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed normal mental development speed whereas the older patients with severe follow-up were limited or no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazyms dosing regimens were performed on the GAG mirror in the urine, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intravenous every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing regimens is equivalent.</seg>

<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleural amesothelioma, Alimta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta were compared to 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease, previously treated with chemotherapy, with the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another cancer drug), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1,725 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and cisplatin survived an average of 12.1 months compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">Patients who had previously received chemotherapy had an average survival time of 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months compared to docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells did longer survive in the administration of Alimta than with the comparison medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission approved the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. a permit for the issuance of Alimta throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each piercing bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), which results in a resolution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary do- sis is extracted and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see Section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is shown in combination with cisplatin for first-line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell carcinoma except for predominant disc epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for treatment in the second-line treatment of patients with Lo- kal advanced or metastatic non-small cell carcinoma except for predominant disc epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface area (KOF) is administered as intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as infusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the Pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of every 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell carcinoma after preceding chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">To reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given on the day before and on the day after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of pemetremixed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also need to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) a week before the first pemetrexed dose as well as after each third irrigation cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients who receive Pemetrexed, a complete blood image should be created before every gift, including differentiation of the leukocytes and thrombocyte umeration.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and Alanin Transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose examination must take place taking into account the Nadirs of the blood image or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of preventative treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">If patients develop non-hematological toxicity ≥ 360 degree 3 (except neurotoxicity), treatment with ALIMTA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA must be aborted if in patients after 2 dose reducti- a hematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity grade 3 or 4 occurs or so on the occurrence of degree 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical trials did not show that patients aged 65 years of age or over 65 years of age had an increased risk of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to inadequate data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical studies, no dose adaptations were necessary for patients with a creatinin clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min, which go beyond the dose adaptations recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinin clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper limit value and / or transaminasenvalues of &gt; the 3,0-fold of the upper limit value (in the absence of liver metastases) or &gt; 5,0-times the upper limit value (for presence of liver metastases) were not studied specifically in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to bone marsureosuppression and Pemetrexed should not be given to patients before their absolute neutrophora count once again reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombo- cyte number has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrality, thrombocyte number and maximum non-hematological toxicity observed in the previous cycles of treatment (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 hematological and niabatological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was beached when pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with pemetrexed need to be used to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid simultaneous use of nonsteroidal antiphlogistika (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days prior to treatment, on the day of therapy and minimum 2 days after therapy with pemetremixed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients for treating pemetremixed should avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-life for at least 5 days prior to treatment, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetremixed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in whom these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, a drainage of the effusion is to be induced in patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space prior to pemetreboxed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 Several cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were reported in clinical trials involving pemetrexed occasional, if this substance was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, simultaneous use of attenuated live vaccines (except jaundice, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible damage of reproductive capacity by means of pemetrexed, men should be advised against the treatment regimen to obtain advice regarding the retention of sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal renal function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min), high doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid can lead to reduced Pemetremixed excretion with the result of an increased incidence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore, caution is advised if in patients with normal renal function (creatinin-clearing ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid can be applied in high doses.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses for at least 2 days prior to the therapy, be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetrexed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data is available for interaction with NSAIDs with long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, simultaneous use with Pemetrexed must be avoided at least 5 days prior to the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetre- mixed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interaction between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International Regised Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed should not be used during pregnancy, except if necessary and after careful consideration of the benefit for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Given the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive capacity by means of pemetrexed, men should be advised to consult with regard to the blocking of the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether pemetremixed passes into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breastfed infant cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the incidence and severity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma who were randomised to Cisplatin and Pemetrexed, as well as 163 patients with mesothelioma who received cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is a antineoplastic anti-folate which performs its effect by interrupting weight-dependent metabolic processes that are necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that pemetremixed acts as an antiquate with multiple targets by blocking the thymidylsynthase (DHFR), Dihydrological reductase (DHFR) and glycamidribonucleotidfor- myltransferase (GARFT), which are the follow-up key enzymes of the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multi-centric, randomised, randomised Phase 3 trial of ALIMTA plus cisplatin against cisplatin with malignant pleuramesothelioma demonstrated that patients treated with ALIMTA and cisplatin had a clinically significant benefit of median 2.8-month survival compared to patients treated with cisplatin.</seg>

<seg id="2505">If these enzymes are inhibited, they cannot metabolise some fats in the food, causing about a quarter of the fats attributed to food undigested to the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In a third study, Alli was compared with 391 overweight patients with BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In both studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who received the Alli 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg, compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Patients with BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed in patients with BMI of 25 to 28 kg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of Alli (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are oily stains on anus, flatus (winds) with a chair labeling, stuhldl, oily / oily chair, finish oily secretions (fences), flatulence (winds) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It may not be used in patients treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients) or medicines like warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It may also not be used in patients suffering from a long-term malabsorption syndrome (in which not enough nutrients from the digestive tract) or cholestase (liver disease) suffer, and pregnant or breastfeeding mothers.</seg>

<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (Body Mass Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in combination with a slightly hypokaloric, fatty diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">"" "" "" "alli should not be applied by children and young people under 18 because there is not enough data on efficacy and safety." ""</seg>
<seg id="2515">However, since orlistat is only minimally absorbed, no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for elderly people and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin (see section 4.5) • Premature treatment with Warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see section 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The likelihood of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see Section 4.8) may increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich meal or low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Because weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting treatment with alli because the dosage of the antidiabetic must be adjusted possibly.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who use alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmacist if the dose of this drug must be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnant measures to prevent potential failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">In a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous application of orlistat and Ciclosporin, a lowering of the Ciclosporin plasma level was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick values (internationally normally ised ratio, INR) could be affected (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">Most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with orlistat remained the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as beta carotene in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take a supplemental vitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamin intake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the dose of a single dose Amiodaron was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time, a slight decrease in Amiodarone plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Experimental studies did not show any direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are associated with pharmacological effects of the drug, because the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1.000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of unknown side-effects noted after the launch of orlistat is unknown since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of some size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that the treatment with alli can cause anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obese subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after the launch of orlistat overdosing, either side effects or similar adverse events were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on studies on humans and animals can be assumed from a rapid regression of any systemic effects caused by the impassable properties of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect places in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine due to covalent bonds to the active Serin-Rest of the gastre and pankreatic lipases.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Derived from clinical studies, 60 mg of orlistat, taken three times a day, blocked the absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat that was taken three times a day in combination with a hypokalorial, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to baseline (at the time of randomisation), was evaluated as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as a percentage of those participating in study who lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months, the biggest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in the Gesamtcholesterin was with orlistat 60 mg -2.4% (starting value 5,20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (baseline 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol with orlistat was 60 mg -3.5% (starting value 3,30 mmol / l) and with placebo + 3.8% (starting value 3,41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At the waist circumference, the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60mg (starting value 103,7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (starting value 103,5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolised orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, metabolized orlistat in plasma could only be detected sporadically and at extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">Two major metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolyzed Lactonring) and M3 (M1 after separation of the N-Formyl-Leucin group) were identified in a study of obese patients, which represented approximately 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapies that are strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as in chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as an anti-emetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application for patients under the age of 18 is not recommended, as there are not enough information on the effects of this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the substance inhibits binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as serotonin), which prevents receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three major studies of 1,842 adults who received chemotherapies which are strong and moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapy, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with analxi showed no vomiting (132 from 223) in the 24 hours after chemotherapy, compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In the 24 hours after chemotherapy, 81% of patients treated with analxi showed no vomiting (153 of 189) compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 from 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission issued approval to the company of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd., a licence for the marketing of Aloxi in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Alois is indicated: for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly emetogenic chemotherapy as a result of cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy as a result of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of aloxi to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon, patients with amnesty obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advised with the simultaneous administration of palonosetron with medicines which extend the QT interval or in patients with which the Qt interval is extended or which tend to be an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Aloxi is not used to prevent or treat nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not block the activity of the five examined chemotherapy drugs (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, doxorubicine and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of palonosetron and a Steady State- concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and rifampicin) as well as CYP2D6 inhibitors (Amiodarone, Cimetidine, doxorubicin, fluoxetine, ranitidine, Ritonavir, Sertraline and Terbinafin) had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience for the use of palonosetron in human pregnancies is not present, so Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical studies, the most common adverse events were observed in a dose of 250 mcg. (total 633 patients), which at least possibly were related to Aloxi, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration of administration (burning, curing, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage showed similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-effective relationships to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were performed, however, due to the large distribution volume, dialysis is probably not an effective therapy for an overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mcg. of Dolasetron (half-life: 7.3 hours) were given, that was given intravenously on day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients who received a strongly emetogenic treatment with ≥ 60 mg / m2Cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron were compared with patients who received 32 mg Ondansetron, which were given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) the effects of palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to clinical investigations, Palonosetron possesses the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the ECG effects of administered Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous injection follows an initial decrease of plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminale half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the area below the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dose-proportional in the entire dose range of 0.390 μ g / kg for patients and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous administration of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean mean (± SD) increase in Palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations show that the total text position (AUC0- ∞) obtained at once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg Palonosetron was comparable with a once-once intravenous dose of 0.75 mg. however, the CMAx was higher after the one-off dose of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on metabolisation, we showed that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, the isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in urine, Palonosetron as unmodified substance made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous injection, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver function impairment, the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron are increased, however, a reduction in the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were observed only after exposures, which are considered to be sufficiently exposed to the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of preclinical studies, evidence suggests that Palonosetron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channels, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and can prolong the amount of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose was about 30 times the therapeutic exposure in humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine Neoplasms (in thyroid gland, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal mark) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosage and since Aloxi is determined by humans for one-time application, the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a negative report recommending the approval of the drug Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution intended for the treatment of hepatitis C.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same drug which is already approved in the EU (also called" "" "reference drug" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (liver disease caused by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination the liver tissue has been damaged, and the values of the liver enzyme Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) in the blood abnormally increase.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced which stimulates the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presents data showing the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the drug, effectiveness, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">In the study it was measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment responded to the medication (i.e. no evidence of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns have been expressed that data is not sufficient for the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C, which responded to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alpheon, the disease was reduced to more patients than with the reference drug; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study was not sufficiently validated to the extent to which the medicine triggers an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine).</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of Impetigo (skin infection) and small infected Lazerations (torn or cut wounds), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used for treating infections that have been provable or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because it may not affect these kinds of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18, the area to be treated should not be more than 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cluttered after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients with placebo spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected dogs Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together at home dogs, about 90% of the patients responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo is not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (ice-filled cavities in the body tissue) or infections that have been provably or probably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation on the surface of the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo outweigh the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmations, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission issued a licence to the company Glaxo Group Ltd., a permit for the issuance of altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of a sensitization or serious local irritation by applying Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment should be stopped, the ointment is carefully blurred and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection will begin.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not intended to treat infections where MRSA is known as pathogen or is suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">The efficacy of retinapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3-day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retinapamulin and other topical means on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical use on scraped skin or infected superficial wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not to be expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneously oral administration of 2-times daily 200 mg of ketoconazole the mean retinapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx increased after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on scraped skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients, dose adaptations are not considered necessary if topographic retapamulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate in regards to a statement on the effects on the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of Retapamulin is preferable to the application of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">The decision whether the breastfeeding should be continued / terminated or the treatment with Altargo should be continued / terminated is to balance between the benefit of breastfeeding and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials involving 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which Altargo have applied, the most commonly reported side effect irritation at the administration of administration, which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Effect Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Clitopilus passwort-anus (formerly Pleurotus passwort-anus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of action of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of the bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding point of the 50s sub-unit of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data suggests that the binding site of ribosomal protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransferase center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding at this binding post Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide transfer, block partial P-binding interventions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the use of Retapamulin at least some infection forms appear to be questionable, consultation by experts should be sought.</seg>
<seg id="2703">No differences were found in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-response to treatment with S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study of healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was applied daily in occlusion on intact and on laced skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for the topical treatment of secondary traumatized wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Samples were taken on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic absorption in humans after topical application of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 of scraped skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the retinapamulin IC50 for the PGP escapement.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retinapamulin in human liver microsoms was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with minor involvement of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on the oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were performed over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro-examination on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in rats-micro-core test for in-vivo investigation of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rat signs of reduced fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, thus reaching up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure in humans (topical application to 200 cm2 of scraped skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats were detected in oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to ≥ 3-times of estimated human exposure (see above)), development toxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed ossification) and maternal toxicity.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambilla is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years, who are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"" "" "" "Ambilla is used as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may be achieved only after the second dose is given." ""</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambilla may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection while immunization is low and that the vaccination from two doses can be put to an end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose of hepatitis A or B is desired, Ambiata or other hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"" "vaccines work by" "" "teach" "" "the immune system (the body's natural defense) as it can defend itself against a disease." ""</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after receiving the vaccine, the immune system recognises viruses and surface antigens as" "" "alien" "" "and produces antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambilla has the same components as the vaccine granted since 1996 and the vaccine granted since 1997 and the vaccine granted since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix Adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambilla and Twinrix contain adult identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix Adults have also been used as evidence for the use of Ambilla.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentrations a month after the last injections.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study involving 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to a six-month and a 12-month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children, Ambilla conducted a month after the last injections to the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of Ambience protection was similar to a six-month interval between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common adverse events of Ambilla (observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain in the injection area, redness, matchiness (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambilla may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission issued a licence to the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. a permit for the marketing of Ambilla in the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for immunisation with Ambirix consists of two vaccinations, with the first dose on the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher vaccination is required for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, it can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovalent vaccines or a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-Hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-Hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-Hepatitis A virus (anti-HBs) are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured whether immunocompetent individuals who have responded to hepatitis C vaccination may need a refresher vaccination, as they may also be protected by immunological memory in non-detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injections vaccines, for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the administration of the vaccine, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units of formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of haemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, there may be no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody levels under certain circumstances, so that in these cases additional doses of vaccination can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since intradermal injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscles could lead to a suboptimal implication, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, in cases of thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disorders, Ambilla can be injected in an exceptional way, as it can occur in these cases after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambilla was administered in the second year in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined diarrhea, tetanus, acellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenza vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it may be assumed that a sufficient immune response may not be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccines of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, matchiness, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thiomercial and preservative-based vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccinations were administered to a total of 1027 vaccinations at the age of 1 to including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to including 15 years, Ambilla's tolerability was compared with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and matiness on a calculation basis per vaccination dose, but not on a basis of a calculation per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the administration of Ambilla at 50.7% of the subjects, compared with 39.1% in the subjects after the dose of a dose of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who had given Ambirix reported pain, compared to 63.8% with the subjects vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of matchiness was comparable to per proband (i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle at 39.6% of subjects who received Ambilla, compared to 36.2% in the subjects receiving the 3-doses combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of severe pain and maternal mortality was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- to 11-year-old vaccines the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgruppe was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3-doses combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11- year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambilla, a more common incidence of pain (at the injection site) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines that reported severe side effects during the 2-dose immunotherapy with Ambilla or during the 3-dose immunotherapy with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B - was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to including 15 years, Seroconversionrates for Anti-HAV were 99.1% a month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The conversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- and including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambilla and 147 received the standard combinationvaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 persons whose immunogenicity was invaluable, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher against Hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the dose of the 3-dose-impayer significantly higher than with Ambilla.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses, which were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11 year olds one month after completion of the full vaccine series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccinations received either a 2-dose-vaccination scheme with Ambilla or a 3-dose-vaccination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For persons aged between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immunization with Ambilla in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response observed in this study was comparable to that, which was determined after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- and including 15 year olds, it could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 month vaccination scheme is comparable to that in the 0-12 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">When the first dose Ambilla was administered at the same time with the refresh of a combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus influenza vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study carried out with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar seroprotective and serode conversions as for the previous formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined both before and after the resuspense on any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vaccination against completion of the vaccine series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambilla becomes a person who suffers from severe blood clutter disorders, under the skin and not injected into the muscle. • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body's defense / or if you / your child undergo / undergo a hemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambilla may be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take other medicines (including those that you can get without prescription) or if you / your child has been recently vaccinated or has been given / or immunoglobuline (antibody) has received / has or is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambilla, it should be vaccinated in separate places and as different limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, Ambilla is not given to pregnant or breastfeeding women, but it is urgent that they are vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Please inform your doctor if you already have an allergic reaction to Neomycin (antibiotic) with you and your child.</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2797">♦ very common (more than 1 case per 10 decomposed doses): • Pain or discomfort at the insertion point or redness • Matter • irritability • headache • loss of appetite</seg>
<seg id="2798">♦ only (up to 1 case per 10): • swelling at the injection site • Temperature (above 38 ° C) • Responsible • gastrointestinal complaints</seg>
<seg id="2799">Other side effects, which were reported very rare days or weeks after vaccination with comparable combination or single vaccines against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (less than 1 case per 10,000 vaccinated doses) are:</seg>
<seg id="2800">These include locally restricted or extended rashes that can be itching or blower, swelling of the eye and face, aggravating breathing or swallowing, sudden drop in blood pressure and unconsciousness.</seg>
<seg id="2801">Flu-like discomfort, including chills, muscle and joint pain seizures, dizziness, insensitivity like tingling and "ant-run," Multiple sclerosis, disorders of the optic nerve, loss of sensation or mobility of some body parts, severe headaches and stiffness of the neck, interruption of normal brain functions</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambilla is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data, which have been known since the issuance of first approval for placing on the market, the CHMP noted that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambilla remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was only launched in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug are limited due to the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Formaldehyde can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzyme defects or with hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in the prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonia is - divided into several single doses at meals - swallowed, mixed with food or via a gastrostomiessis (through the abdominal wall in the stomach of leading tube) or a nasal probe (through the nose in the stomach of leading tube) administered.</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, as ammonia could not be compared with a different treatment or placebo (a pseudodrug, i.e. without active substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonia can also lead to loss of appetite, low levels of acidity in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disorders or flavor release, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The CHMP Committee for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that ammonia in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevents high ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "ammonia was approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "because of the rarity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information to this medicine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients, in which a complete enzymatic deficiency has already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manifolate form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests after the first month of life), there is an indication for use when there is a hyperammonia encephalopathy in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granule form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the patient's growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight exceeding 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithine transcarate syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an arginine osuccinatsynthetase deficiency must be obtained arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with swallowing disorders because there is a risk of the formation of esophagusulcera when the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which is equivalent to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency as well as with sodium retention and edema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Because metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate is carried out via the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should be used only with extreme caution in patients with liver or renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">For subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), there was a slowdown of neuronal proliferation and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed ripening of cerebral synapses and a decreased number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be ascertained whether phenylacetate is excreted in humans in breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during breastfeeding time (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS at least 56% of patients had at least an undesirable event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that they were not connected with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old abnormal patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactate dose, severe hypokalemia, pancytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overdose entered a 5 month old small child with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity in intravenous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolically active compound that conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram biased sodium phenylbutyrate between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infused, and the disease itself led to death in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or their sticky analogues within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By means of hemodialysis, the utilization of alternative pathways of nitrogen excretion (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced food and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn in postpartum (however within the first month of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyperammonia encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients there was time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-manifal form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of the ornithintransponge scarred deficiency), which were treated with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible for treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is associated with glutamine in the liver and kidneys, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and metabolites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, haemoglobin metabolism and liver cirrhosis according to individual indications as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrates and metabolites was also studied in cancer patients following IV administration of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2846">After different doses of phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day), phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day to 20 g / day) was no phenylacetate detectable in the plasma after different doses of phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day).</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis of the liver, which were repeated with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the average phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher on the third day compared to the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The drug is excreted by the kidneys within 24 hours of approximately 80 - 100% in the form of the jugated product phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyrate had no complaining effects (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is either taken orally (infants and children who can not swallow tablets or patients with swallowing disorders) or a gastrostomieschlor or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for newborn infants, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight exceeding 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (in particular branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithine transcarate syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram sodium phenylbutyrate, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which is equivalent to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rats were exposed before the birth of phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrate), lesions were found in the pyramids of the brain cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old abnormal patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactate dose, severe hypokalemia, pancytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of surplus</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, it can be assumed that for each gram the sodium phenylbutyrate can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible for treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in granule form 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the shelf life, the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">The small measuring spoon is 0,95 g, the average measuring spoon is 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing, so they cannot secrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, you must tell the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, since sodium phenylbutyrate may affect the results of certain laboratory investigations.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you are taking AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During breastfeeding, you may not take AMMONAPS, as the drug may pass into breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases, confusion, headaches, taste disturbances, reduction of hearing, disorientation, memory problems and deterioration of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice any of these symptoms, immediately contact your doctor or with the emergency treatment of your hospital for the purpose of initiating appropriate treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example with unstable angina (a form of pain in the chest with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "sting" (an anomalous measurement value in the electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is given and infusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox in sole administration or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug for preventing blood clots) was compared with conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anti-coagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI the patient was often used as a stent (a short tube remaining in the artery to prevent a closure) and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as Abciximab and Aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS Angiox - with or without the Gift of GPI - was just as effective in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks, or revascularization) after 30 days or a year as well as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients undergoing a PCI, Angiox was as effective as heparin in relation to all indicators, except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bias, other brain udine or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may also not be used in patients who recently had hemorrhage, as well as in people with strong high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable substitute for Heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a licence to the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd., a permit for the incorporation of angiox across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST-uplift infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency intervention or early intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous injection of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If the patient subsequently performs a PCI, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion can be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2893">After the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is to be given, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dose of angiox in patients with a PCI is of an initial intravenous injection of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and one intravenous intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a certain Bolus administration of angiox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to under 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be done.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT levels, the reconstituted and diluted drug should be carefully mixed before the application and the dosed dose can be administered rapidly intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether with Bivalira or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is below 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be given and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose can be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate renal damage, included in the III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which was included, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the application of the Bivalira-Bolus without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients Angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intravenous injection of fractionated heparin or 8 hours after completion of the subcutaneous administration of low-molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• hypersensitivity to the active substance or other components or against miludine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to malfunctioning of the hemoglobin system and / or irreversible coagulation disorders. • severe uncontrolled hypertension and subacute bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and in dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially if Bivalira is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if PCI patients under Bivalira occur most bleeding in arterial puncture points, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may occur during the treatment in principle throughout haemorrhages.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who take warfarin and be treated with Bivalira, a monitoring of the INR value (International Regised Ratio) should be taken into consideration to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bivalira reach the existing level before treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on knowledge about the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or thrombocyte aggregations), it can be assumed that these active agents increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of Bivalentudin with thrombocyte aggregators or anticoagulants, clinical and biological hemostasis parameters are regularly checked regularly.</seg>
<seg id="2911">In relation to the effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development, animal experiments are inadequate (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalira alone, 4604 were randomised to Bivalira plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unquestionable heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalira Group and in the comparison groups treated with Heparin, there were more adverse events in women as well as patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding was defined according to the Acuity and Timi scales for severe bleeding such as in the footnotes of Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleedings were significantly less common under Bivalira than in groups with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An agcuity severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intraarterial, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the point area, which required radiological or surgical intervention, reduction of the haemoglobin level of ≥ 3 g / dl with well-known bleeding center, reduction of hemoglobin levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with a well-known bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed blood localizations, which occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" points of position, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following data about side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with Bivalira in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalira Group and in the comparison groups treated with Heparin, there were more adverse events in women as well as patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both mild and severe bleedings were significantly less common under Bivalira than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, have been reported after a comprehensive application in practice and are grouped according to system organ classes in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of an overdose, the treatment with bivalent udine must be stopped immediately and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalent inhibitor, a direct and specific platelbininhibitor, which binds to the catalytic center as well as to the andilation region of Thrombin, regardless of whether thrombin is bound in the fluid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalira to Thrombin, and thus its effect, is reversible because Thrombin on its part breaks the binding of Bivalira-ARG3-Pro4, thus regenerating the function of the active centre of thromboin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, there were no thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS).</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients, Bivalira has a dose-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is demonstrated by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was carried out in the following cases, an additional bolt of 0,5mg / kg Bivalira should be given and the infusion for the duration of surgery can be increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In arm A of the Acuity study, fractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable Angina / Non-ST lever infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either before the beginning of angiography (at the time of randomisation) or PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the Acuity study the characteristics of high-risk patients, which required angiography within 72 hours, were distributed evenly across the 3 arms.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is administered subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or the upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose (sugar) in the blood or insulin cannot be processed effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very slightly from insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has shorter working duration than a short-acting humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and enrolled in a study involving 572 children aged between four and 17.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, in which the body cannot be processed effectively, Apidra has been studied in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed after six months compared to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin lisp.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction of HbA1c concentrations was 0.46% after six months compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulins or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a licence to the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for the placing of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra can be used as a subcutaneous injection in either the abdominal wall, thigh or delta muscle or subcutaneously by continuous infusion in the area of the pancreas.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to reduced gluconic capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, the need for insulin can be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the effectiveness, the brand (her- or), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-retarded, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can result in a change in insulin requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dosage or abortion of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Changing a patient to a different type of insulin or an insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the effectiveness of the insulin and can therefore change during the conversion of the treatment diagram.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that can increase blood sugar-lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrate, fluoxetine, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, among the effects of sympatholytics such as beta blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidine and Reserpin may be weakened or missing symptoms of adrenergic counterregulation.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and humaninsulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lulisin occurs in human breast milk, but generally insulin does not involve breast milk, nor is it resorbed to oral use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">The following are listed in clinical trials, sorted by system organ classes and sorted by decreasing frequency of occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 1000; rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on available data).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold - Welness, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration disturbance, dizziness, confusion, lack of vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipoystrophy is omitted to continuously change the injection area within the injection area, as a result, a lipoystrophy may occur at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by means of an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg), given by an appropriately trained person, or by intravenous glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After glucoagine injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to investigate the cause of severe hypoglycemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose absorption (especially skeletal musculature and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the case of subcutaneous GA- be of insulin lulisin the effectiveness occurs faster and the duration of action is shorter than with cou- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes milli, insulin lulisin in the therapeutically relevant dosage range from 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a dose proportional to glucose-reducing effect, and at 0.3 mg / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosity-reducing effect, just like humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosity effect about 2 hours earlier as a human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was obvious that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, a comparable post-denal glycemic control is reached like with human insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin lulisin was applied 2 minutes before the meal, a better postpdenal control was achieved than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin lulisin is applied in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control is achieved, as with human normal insulin, which is given 2 Mi- grooves before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin for 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) and compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lulisin for 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the beginning of the meal compared to human normal malinsulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
