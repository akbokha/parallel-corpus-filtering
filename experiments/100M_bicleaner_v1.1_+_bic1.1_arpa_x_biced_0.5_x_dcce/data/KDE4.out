the package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them more readily available .
more information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select settings extensions set up .... Open the card card tools and select the desired modules there .
this is a list of default settings from the box ; add@@ ons . please note that possibly more modules on your system are installed if you have installed additional software .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click on the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on extras crashes . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , or drop the list of crashes if available .
the module An@@ nex Filter ( also called Fol@@ der Fil@@ ters ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras address filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default , the display starts with the root node of the document , Ex@@ ample : DVI element , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the M@@ IME type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the inferior objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
with &amp; FS@@ View , the size of a file or folder reflects the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it . in this way , large files can be easily recognized even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View may be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you are considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap diagram is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your file system . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have sensible colour recognition and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can either represent depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the image of a different file property such as name , owner , group or M@@ IME type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is sufficient space to display or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles should occur . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle .
for display algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . in case of the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always respected . it is used to draw parameters that are no longer available for subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the square is square .
how division of the surface of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is done , the implementation remains left to the implementation . here , it is always advantageous for labelling and avoid@@ ance of space losses through framework , that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ sive branches .
you can set the minimum shown area for an entry on the menu item View on area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn to the surface of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally , &amp; FS@@ View was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets developed for the K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind application .
the module Picture Gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras image gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
when you access the module image gallery , a dialog opens , which allows you to set the image of the gallery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tit@@ le &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option allows you to customize the title of the image gallery page in a text entry field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the images per line has a slider and a rotation field to set the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; View &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; file name of the image , you specify whether the fil@@ en@@ ames are displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the file size check box size of the image , you specify whether the file size is displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
with the image size check box , you specify whether the size of the images is displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
in the dialog folder you specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included .
in the Save in HTML file , specify where the HTML page is to be saved .
with the sub @-@ folder check box , you can set up with a slider or a turn field , to which level the sub@@ folders will be included .
you can copy the original pictures to the gallery using the original pictures .
using the comment file check box , you can specify a comment file for describing the images in the gallery .
you can specify a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails as in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; Settings allows you to easily access the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
the Media Play@@ back for the navigation pane can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; View menu under Windows Navigation Section or with the F@@ 9 short@@ cut short@@ cut .
to play , click on the navigation area of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback .
changing browser detection adds a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; in addition , you can change browser and operating system identi@@ fiers for single domains . this is helpful for web pages that allow access only with certain browsers .
the standard browser detection of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you are denied access to this browser , change browser detection to one of the following options .
changes the password in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that reject access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla . for example , you need the M@@ SI@@ E browser detection to access with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; hot@@ mail .
pages that do not correspond to the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - Elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this obsol@@ ete browser .
with this option , the inserted browser detection is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing .
with the menu entry ... you can adjust the amount of information on the used browser and operating system in the individual .
with this &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; module check your &amp; CSS ; style sheets and &amp; HTML ; documents according to the recommendations of the W@@ 3@@ C and other standards .
check the website &apos;s website check in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; check the Tools Website menu . you can do the following tests :
with the &amp; HTML , check if your &amp; HTML ; -@@ Document of the syntax of &amp; HTML ; all found errors are displayed . with this check you can make sure your pages are displayed properly by all browsers .
allows you to check your &amp; CSS ; style sheets embedded in a &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; document . with valid &amp; CSS ; your web pages have a uniform look , independent of the browser used .
check the links on your page on for@@ warding and er@@ ron@@ eous links . recur@@ sively check all links on the website .
here you specify the addresses of the servers for checking your &amp; HTML ; documents and &amp; CSS ; style sheets .
with the module web archiving for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; you can store web pages with text and images in .@@ pdf format .
&quot; &quot; &quot; click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Archive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to archive the mouse on the Tools website and a dialog appears to save the displayed web page . &quot; &quot; &quot;

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digit@@ ally ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; includes quick image editing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE image plu@@ gins interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ kam , it is easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG @-@ export and ICC colour management workflow .
improved database with considerably more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or lens that can be searched for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also digi@@ ti@@ zed ; an open source project . that means , it depends on the support of end users . you should therefore report problems and improvement possibilities .
&amp; nbsp ; tries to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu provides a page in the error report system . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error report system .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that means that the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to invite you to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam . you can ask here questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
you can also check the digi@@ cam ; visit homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
the best way to get involved is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for logging in to the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you first start , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database . you can specify a local , remote or removable folder . simply type the path name or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will also be used as an old library .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains pictures , as base folder . &amp; digi@@ kam ; view every sub@@ folder as an album . no image will be changed .
&amp; nbsp ; Dur@@ ing recur@@ sively the library path in its full depth . you cannot exclude sub @-@ folders unless it i@@ ste in hidden folder . this can be done ex@@ hal@@ bs &amp; digi@@ kam ; complete a point in front of the sub@@ folder &apos;s name .
if you take an existing folder with photos as base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have any photos as symbols . you can change this by using any photo from the album and disc@@ ard it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My Pla@@ ying i@@ ste to manage your photos in the albums .
the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the help of raw camera support .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow sections .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digit@@ ally ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera then appears as a disk drive . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
digi@@ 2 is a free , exten@@ dable software collection for digital cameras , which supports an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and are slow regarding the serial port , this connection is now obsol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found at this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to reliably read the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ K@@ am . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , thumb@@ nails may not be seen or the creation could be very slow .
one of the nic@@ est things to do is how easy it is to expand its functionality through modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plug @-@ ins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as it can be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes came in &amp; digi@@ kam ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the page strings with &amp; L@@ MB , or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
drag and drop images works everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the old tree , above the horizontal partition line or in another application window . the only limitation is that a picture can not be placed in keywords , date list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , the fil@@ tern functions on the file name only if this ind the symbol view is also displayed . which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ Settings .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos that are managed by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive , after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was first created .
if you have created a scanner you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select album Im@@ ports images to scan . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . select album Im@@ ports screen shot .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop there . in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , right @-@ click on the album and select album properties in the context menu .
album collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name . the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos if you want to select or delete albums by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the settings for collections .
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with View albums Fol@@ der Date .
buttons El@@ ders , A@@ verage , New Year : these set the date to the oldest , the newest picture or section of the album . this first tries to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder .
when you first open an album in &amp; quot ; open , the first picture will be selected in the album as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu &amp; quot ; As Alb@@ um@@ vor@@ schau@@ en@@ quot ; select . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images will be shown in this album in the screen . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two lou@@ pe buttons in the tool@@ bar .
if you open an album the first time , you need to wait for a moment while the thumb@@ nails will be generated . you can avoid this in which you can recre@@ ate all preview images in the Extras menu .
information about each image will be displayed below the thumb@@ nail . what information this is , you can change over settings digi@@ cam ; set up . select the albums page and adjust the thumb@@ nail area to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help window which appears . if you let the mouse cur@@ sor rest for a moment over a picture . the help displays the most important features including all tags of a photo . the screen@@ shot above in the section Intro@@ duction to the main window shows such a help window .
photos are all the thing about digi@@ kam ; goes . albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it fits you . image editing displays your photos and allows you to accomplish a number of improvements to this . you can reach all the functions that came with &amp; digi@@ cam ; you can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or the editing of the images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 Image editing ... or select the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit ... to edit your photos . with image editing , you can view your photos and change them .
it may happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in a different program by right @-@ clicking the context menu and select the program from the sub@@ menu of opening . this , and how you adapt them to your needs , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing by other image editing programs , problems with the metadata contained in the picture may not work . some programs do not store these data with when you store the modified image . this will result in loss of information from EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data such as orientation , aper@@ ture etc .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides two ways to rotate . the easiest way is to ri@@ ght@@ click the preview and select rotate . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right @-@ click on the preview and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . keep in mind that you maintain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc . ) .
if you delete a photo and delete it , it will be moved to the garbage dump of &amp; k@@ de ; move . F@@ 8 Photo Del@@ ete or Del if you &apos;d rather want to delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
the View &amp; quot ; My dates listing ; organize your photos on the basis of the data . &amp; quot ; use either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the dat@@ as@@ he@@ et below in the data view so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown .
photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search again .
when a keyword is selected , all the photos that have been marked with this keyword will be displayed .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My Key@@ word@@ list . so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keywords in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either on &amp; quot ; My Key@@ wor@@ te@@ quot ; or click on an existing keyword and then choose New Key@@ word . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this keyword will be the sub@@ stit@@ ch@@ word of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting del@@ e@@ tion . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword , drag it to the desired position in the tree and place it there . then a menu appears that gives you the option to post@@ p@@ one the keyword . a keyword can only be once in a tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by right @-@ clicking and selecting the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select as album preview in the context menu . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
this can be done in two ways : once you select the photos you want to provide with a keyword , you can drag it to the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords &apos; . alternatively , you can also ri@@ ght@@ click on the preview of the pictures and select from the context menu keyword .
you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed once you select one of the words assigned to it . in this way you can set a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event at which it was made etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , it will appear in the main window under the preview .
you can remove a keyword using the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select from the tag menu . the menu only shows the keywords that were assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view displays a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you just have to click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the radio box indicating the time unit . this will display all the associated images in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will then appear in the list below .
include all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and more in the future .
if you click here , the filtering will be deleted and all images will be displayed again . if the search has not found , then the lamp will be red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you can save a simple search box as described above . you can however save this search here as a live search , which always filters that which you have entered as a search criterion . after you have been saved , it appears in the list .
when you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and the search will be performed . the results are displayed in my search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching , you just have to select the appropriate entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu .
if you select to edit search , the search form will appear again with the previously entered search information . if you select as an advanced search , the Advanced Search dialog appears to change your previous search .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select the search context menu .
the Advanced search provides you with an extended search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . all rules are added by line , by operators . an option can be added to this list with search group / search group . additionally , you can create search of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this makes it possible to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two picture signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop any picture to find a similar . by means of a sw@@ ell@@ ist the choice of results can be enlarged or reduced . if you push a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it down there .
sketch : free @-@ hand colour sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ kam ; find the right pictures . here too , a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini program . you can move in or zoom with the mouse wheel or move it . push C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to pull a square . all images inside these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for a later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a lamp table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em Ligh@@ table add from the context menu . the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window opened . if you are back in &amp; edited ; main window , you can quickly open the illuminated table with L Extras illuminated .
from the thumb@@ nail , you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window and place it there . a small arrow tells you which copy in which window area is to be seen .
another mode is better suited to quickly sort out of a series of images . if you use pair mode navig@@ ating from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the same areas for compar@@ isons . use now the left mouse button on any preview screen to display it in the right area . this simpli@@ fies it to work through a number of similar images .
of course , normal sol@@ der actions also work directly from the beam like e.g. F@@ 4 file ...
all image information from the main window side@@ bar is available for both preview images in the illuminated table . this makes it easy to connect visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in pi@@ v@@ ot function that you can see at the crossed arrows . in order to rotate the visible area of the picture , you must click on them and hold the &amp; L@@ MB . in the preview , both pictures will show the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works just as in other views . simply use the zoom kno@@ bs below the pictures or c@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both pictures when you are in the preview mode .
what is a digital stock management - away from the fashion word ? digital stock management considers every part of the process that follows after the picture has been taken up to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos absor@@ bs , scans or stores digital photos leads to a form of digital inventory management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient manner .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips as you can back up your images , find , protect , and use photos again . we will focus on the procedures for digital photographers the &amp; digi@@ kam . we will consider the download , ren@@ ame , remove , convert , group , back , optimize , wait and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital asset management takes on , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , transformed , conf@@ ec@@ tioned and exports contents which have a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is , according to your definition , data that provide information about or documentation of other data administered by an application or environment .
I dare to claim that if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer then you do not need to find a specific photo without stock management . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then use it not &amp; digi@@ kam ; . the approach to store the metadata in both a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searching and a secure archiving on which you can freely access other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you care about anything in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you need to decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . make sure you have to switch to a larger drive at some point .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly through your location , unless you were in a year several times in the same place . if you do enough photos then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . then you will be able to export a folder for images you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new files .
the separation of original and work files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
we also recommend the option of saving metadata in the settings page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ kam ; it ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the respective item in the album &apos;s menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? to do so , it provides a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are , of course , the most important ones .
now the real work begins , since you should assign each photo to keywords , labels and an evaluation . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then . this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos in the further work .
let &apos;s now use keywords , keywords , as you often call other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam will automatically build the tree for you or insert the pictures to the right place . changing the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dra@@ gging a sub @-@ tree to another .
the graphic shows how different metadata is overl@@ apping . this is a very coarse representation since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to descriptions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to let anyone see your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , family , photographers and agencies .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you this of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start dreaming of having associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence . so the let@@ tering has completely changed your perception of this panorama .
for others that view your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help Him over the motive that you have moved has to understand what you understand .
it &apos;s fine if a picture is not perfect if it &apos;s the strength only to work with a let@@ tering for itself .
with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as a label . K@@ DE even provides a sp@@ ell@@ chec@@ ker . if you export your pictures in web galleries , then these labels will not tell you a second time according to your wishes .
remember the times ahead of GPS ? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system ? wasn &apos;t it Earth a boring Planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now runs with speed of light .
the possibilities to exploit the ge@@ olo@@ cation are already innum@@ erable and will be even deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your journeys using images with geographical data . &amp; nbsp ; can also export k@@ ml files that you can open with Google Earth .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word@@ play with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ edoms are also valid in all changed versions , i.e. also for the works of others .
the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; as information should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should include your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used .
author title ( syn@@ onym for the author line ) : linked to the author . this field contains the work description of the photographer . examples of this can be as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent photographer .
editor ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group / agency that offers the picture here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections although they do not offer protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than base knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify this information embedded in the picture . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .

of course we do not talk about CDs that were lost on the street or on a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , it is about problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll On@@ Track , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
in order to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be treated cau@@ ti@@ ously and you may not be trusted more than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archi@@ ved quality , which last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold @-@ coated DVDs , &amp; Dollar ; 2 the piece which claims a lifetime of 100 years .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and storing them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable to errors , even if they have just been written . that &apos;s why they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data is only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and the check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust , etc .
for defective CDs and DVDs there is a cheap program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently works wonders for CDs and DVDs . it runs on Windows and &amp; Linux ; but it &apos;s not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to win the format war against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disk can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said about CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
do not burn the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store it on a clean , dark dry and protected site . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
disk manufacturers retain their stat@@ s for themselves . their manufacturing warran@@ ts include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives on this subject .
in brief : disks are the longest if they are operated at 35 ° C to 45 ° C in the Temper@@ ature range . electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason , S@@ MAR@@ T cannot detect these errors .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have saved the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems .
while most electrical devices do not make much noise , this can cause serious damage in devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these can cause serious damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause serious key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed mo@@ ther@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able loss of time and money .
the most common protection against current tips is a surge protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy heat and avoids the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . remember , however , that not every plug @-@ in bar also contains over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . it guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also make sure that it provides protection against ligh@@ tening and therefore protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are also protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage sha@@ kers which also have a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while a surge protection system protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even an om@@ is@@ sion of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs . some models even allow them to continue working until the current runs out . if you buy a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in current problems with the cost of avoiding these . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V you can get for less than &amp; euro ; this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it . at the end , you should always remember all the cables before going on holiday .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amount of data .
they are , however , very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data via the comparatively slow internet .
the solution is therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are provided on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online .
web solutions are very secure from the point of view of data backup . due to the TCP protocol , transmission errors are automatically cleaned and the large companies included in the offer a backup and a distributed storage .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are prone to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing about it is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all these disturbances are un@@ discovered until you one day open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise . it &apos;s quite disturbing that there is no protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate interference within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 , you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with record errors on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one of the GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . it is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms the Z@@ FS is used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % of the workplace systems . in case of not@@ ebooks the proportion of th@@ ef@@ ts is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it causes minor damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; nobody has been si@@ ghted for a long time .
open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the wi@@ dest fil@@ es@@ ystems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investig@@ ative process at a sudden inter@@ ruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft , and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristic for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit .
even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is worse . a sensor size of 6 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els and a high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ xel . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard disk today for 100 &amp; euro ; so you don &apos;t have to worry anyone else for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected every year by a data loss . therefore , secure your data according to a plan and test this backup before you make any hazardous like the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives .
suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive daily . if , then one day , a flash will hit you if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget your air@@ space : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous for your data . they usually affect a whole room or entire house .
therefore des@@ aster prevention is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighbouring house , into your office or anything like that .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a common cause for data loss despite backup is the panic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that should be secured . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates several sn@@ apshots . you can restore the original status at any time in which such a backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only r@@ sync the difference of files that have really been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to DVD or other optical media .
this procedure lets you discover and restore losses . at the same time you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the work files . in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month .

so valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the time period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you need to consider all that is being said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate while time passes . unfortunately , there is no other way to be considered a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance . the less variations you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered with the explanation in this document . use or change open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the technical expression for the ability to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have set up the scal@@ ability and want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . in * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new record :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g whether your new record has been detected by the system , but don &apos;t impose it .
&amp; Dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; Par@@ ted resi@@ ze / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; disk size in MB@@ M ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; Dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of disk if necessary
open source standards have the major advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it , you can create them yourself .
G@@ IF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore .
P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard that should replace G@@ IF . it can save much more . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per colour channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can store gam@@ ma@@ - and chrom@@ ati@@ city data for improved color allocation for hetero@@ geneous platforms .
TI@@ FF was widely used as image format . TI@@ FF is stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . with some cameras you can save your pictures in this format . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG &apos;s digital Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open format format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and is committed to using metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope that the competitor Canon and Nikon will use it at some point .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Image Resources Block quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a coding technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file itself . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP fits , since it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems in connection between the metadata file and the image file , and as mentioned above , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put it all together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organisation dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a large range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to gain a broad acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or scanner . as long as the images on the camera screen are , you can use this as temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
for a fine @-@ lay@@ ered processing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images with &amp; digi@@ kam again , then you should add the metadata again . these were actually cut off from the other programs .
protect the edited pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only in web@@ gal@@ eries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the addition of a photo to an album you will find a description of how you can add photos that you have already on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting pictures to your Al@@ ben@@ database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , connect them to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and switch it . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it attempts to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a he@@ x indicator will appear at the bottom end and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will appear . some cameras don &apos;t display thumb@@ nails .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog features file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the tab metadata shows the internal metadata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer notes , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as in the metadata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image editing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is to download the click on the download button and then download the selection of All . this downloads all photos from their camera into one album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . when downloading , the photos will not be deleted and we recommend checking if the pictures were securely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired selection of &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the download button and then download Sel@@ ected . download the selected button until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New Download is available . these images have not yet been downloaded by &amp; digi@@ kam . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded .
if you want to download the buttons all or download Sel@@ ected albums , a dialog with which you can select the target album is displayed in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums is displayed in the My Albums section . select the destination album from the list and press OK .
after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; edited ; download the photos from the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by del@@ eting the delete button . if you want to delete only a few , you must select it first and delete the selected deleted .
please note that there is no way to restore images that you deleted from the camera . the photos are not moved to the garbage dump of &amp; k@@ de ; they should be checked carefully before you delete them from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera , you should do this via the camera name , as this is much faster .
cameras often use not particularly meaningful names as fil@@ en@@ ames . the fil@@ en@@ ames are normally recycled after the photos are deleted from the camera . this can result in double file names if you load photos from different recording galleries into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time on which the image was made to include the file name .
in the next section , you will find options for turning and mirr@@ oring the image and file @-@ based sub@@ titles . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created per day automatically .
the options Dur@@ ing the commit opens up three more options that are executed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two relate to the information about the author in the standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty section . if you select this , the corresponding entries from the Ex@@ if information are copied to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
if you want another date format than the standard format , e.g. in the edit field , you can use the pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % S . switch to the date &amp; time option . for further adjustments you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you are using the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Camera File &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters . or , in upper@@ case , if you prefer this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ kam ; for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; can use all information on orientation of the camera to the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during download . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ adata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
automatic rotation is usually turned on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , it is digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the photo is in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the Advanced button and select automatic rotation in the lower area of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date in which the photo was taken , can &amp; digi@@ kam ; this sub @-@ albums are based on the image data . all images with the same date are uploaded into the same sub@@ version . not all cameras provide this information . in the section page bar met@@ a data , you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually turned off , and in this case , &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you must turn this option off . use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . then select Up@@ loading . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that should be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , ask &amp; digi@@ kam ; you where the images should be uploaded . a folder selection dialog appears for the camera . select the folder you want and press OK to upload the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . it refers to a position indicated in lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude and which can be displayed on a map . the identification of the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to carto@@ graphy an area through automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser with a click that displays the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; nbsp ; users who want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ings and map references . so , the question is actually more , how the data comes into these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the correct hardware , about re@@ processing the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic mapping ( manual ) and last about manual input of known places .
as far as we know there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receivers . either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you must save these data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the geographic mapping module .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows , and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and from the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and lati@@ tude or other data then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the acci@@ dent@@ als of ha@@ iry coordinates created for example by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; try to give you as much control over its workflow as you can . there are many settings that change the behaviour of &amp; digi@@ kam . to access these settings , you need to edit the Settings menu in eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons on the left .
select action on embedded preview or start image editing . you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; establish if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected for downloading from the camera interface .
author title is a syn@@ onym for author line : this field should include the professional title of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as hired photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a closer description of the car , this must also be filled .
editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify which the photo offers . this does not have to be the author , if it works for a news agency , such as Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here as this represents the picture to others &amp; quot ; . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group or agency that provides the picture will be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not just in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported in &amp; digi@@ kam ; imported without losing .
cap@@ tions as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the pictures . this allows your cap@@ tions to be read by other image viewers .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse cur@@ sor stays in the main window over a file . depending on the option selected , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ kam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify what file types &amp; digi@@ kam , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . each file in a &amp; digi@@ kam ; album folder that has none of these extensions , edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; ignored .
you can reset the default settings again by pressing the Ref@@ res@@ h button to the right of each category .
some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . however , some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , then you can get better results .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar when you use image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bri@@ ghter color in the image . these colors are set here . in the image processing this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation .
with the P@@ NG compression option , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality because P@@ NG uses a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast calcul@@ ator , you can set this value to high compression .
use the TI@@ FF file to comp@@ ress the def@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it has no influence on the image quality since the def@@ late algorithm works loss@@ less .
with the loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss@@ less . even if you select the loss@@ less setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was just a picture viewer for photos . currently , it evol@@ ves very quickly to a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of image editing .
the standard note is that all green pixels are equal . if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor respond more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels in odd lines , this difference creates a lat@@ tice pattern in output . if you use this option , solve this problem with minimal loss of details . this option records the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is to use a fixed color balance , which is based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images will get more details in the top lights in four steps . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
the standard is the pointed lights , so the parts of your images are burned @-@ in due to the inability of your camera to catch the sh@@ utter lights . use the setting cut in white in the settings . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the peak lights .
this is possible because blue pixels generally do not satur@@ ate as fast as green and red . &amp; nbsp ; and d@@ cra@@ w try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions of the still un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question how much colour or white you want .
if you select the re@@ constructing option , you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image .
put the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing . in order to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing to be small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a demo icing algorithm is a digital imaging process to calculate a complete picture of the raw data that come from the color filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color design .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ei@@ ty @-@ Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a color sof@@ tening correction , because you are performed during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives directions as it should be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as the color information from a color space in the other to translate , so that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when an image is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files .
color profile folder Find here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can store all your profiles .
settings of the ICC profiles you have the possibility &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be deposited . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here , only your pictures color does not color the entire screen .
the input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model that you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , e.g. Canon , that do not contain any color mapping or g@@ amma correc@@ tions . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma doesn &apos;t correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you need to carry out the color mapping itself .
there are other options such as the Soft Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate as your image would be returned by a device . this is very useful before you print picture because your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very satisfied . this could be manually corrected instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it is pretty obvious what color profile is intended for . unfortunately not in the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course , this answer is un@@ official :
the Canon profile expansion lets you recognize the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing . by deplo@@ ying this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam can support ; many modules written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these will be loaded by &amp; digi@@ kam ; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Quick commands .
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds is fine . the other check boxes turn the metadata onto or off , which are displayed at the bottom end of the images during the ad .
on the right @-@ hand side there is a knob of automatic detection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the image display mode . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire bulk storage are supported .
at the bottom you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , where you mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn on .
try out if &amp; digi@@ kam ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera od@@ ell and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera &apos;s menu .
you can select any name for your camera . this will be shown in the main window &apos;s menu . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the option &quot; confirmation dialog &quot; for moving pictures in the bel@@ lows , you can edit &amp; edit images ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you can find further details in the del@@ e@@ tion of a photo and del@@ e@@ tion of an album .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly applied by &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise you need to save the changes with the button changes .
you can also display the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ kam ; em@@ bed it when starting . this speeds up the starting process of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
the setting Bei@@ m Start to search for new photos is forcing &amp; digi@@ kam ; looking for new or deleted albums / photos . this length@@ ens the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something was deleted from the base folder , ask &amp; digi@@ kam ; you know if it should delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ kam ; used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from the tool@@ bar in settings design . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find further information in this tutorial .
&amp; nbsp ; includes quick image editing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selecting the item A@@ ds / Edit .
image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam . so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see the image editing section .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently needed features .
the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using file storage or the Save button from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image .
you may need to make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore or Button re @-@ produce image processing button in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you have done in the photo since last saving .
almost any action of image editing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting or restoring the edit by modi@@ fying and restoring from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should make the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z for undo and note C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ switch @-@ Z to restore .
when you press the &amp; L@@ MB , press a moment longer via the undo or restore button in the tool@@ bar , you get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed and restored .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , down picture or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the view menu .
to customize a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select magni@@ fication factor
view full screen mode . you come to the normal view where you can use the Es@@ c key . normally , the tool@@ bar will be displayed . if you don &apos;t want this , you can edit it in the editing dialog .
if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or whole sets . whole picture front pages can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the pictures using the standard methods and select from the menu album Export As@@ sist . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; main window has a side bar at the right edge , providing important information and actions for the selected images . the same side bar is available without the navigation file , also available in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab allows the side@@ bar to appear or disappear again .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied into EX@@ IF and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are transformed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you have commented , use either the user button or just change to the next image , the labels will then be saved .
besides the user button , there is a button More . with this you can read further metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always carried out if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images .
the evaluation section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu .
the assessment is posted to the IP@@ TC field of ur@@ gency . the code follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword @-@ tree and a selection box with the keywords used before in this &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed session .
the keyword is dynamically adapted to the searched keyword , so you can quickly limit the number of options when searching for keyword . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is a further relief in the input of keywords during a series of pictures . if you typ@@ ed several keywords , they are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field keyword .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only apply to the highlighted image and not the entire selection , if you want to add a keyword , please read the Key@@ word filter section .
the page bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side bar is used with their Album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , keyword and search views . if in addition one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop tags . assuming you have selected several images in the main view , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection . then a dialog appears that will ask you if you want to set the keyword .
in the upper case , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is based on K@@ eine keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . you have been selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a keyword from the right keyword is drawn to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword should be set .
this search for changes will take place at any start of the program . it can also be switched off in settings Vari@@ ous .
if you have a rule with and created , and find that it needs to be one or more , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the record searching in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , key word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can specify an advanced search on all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the group@@ ing button . the options then look like this :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? free space is limited to 1 GB and you won &apos;t want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s specific implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that your camera or scanner will have a predictable devi@@ ation from the actually photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or sc@@ anners and that the colours you print or publish on the web from your digital dark@@ room .
if the subject comes to colour management , everyone wants to know which buttons they need to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should provide you with sufficient background information about color management . in addition , you should make links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions to make you the desired result .
if your image workflow satis@@ fies all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
they work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see further information below )
your only other image issues are e @-@ mail or web where s@@ RGB is de @-@ facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should you use another color space and have to think about color management ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colours we can really see is presented below . it shows a two @-@ dimensional representation of all the colours we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excellent site and click Info and then on information About RGB working spaces .
do I have to c@@ alli@@ br@@ ate my monitor if I chose to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you work in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you must c@@ alli@@ br@@ ate your monitor since s@@ RGB means that your monitor is c@@ alli@@ br@@ ated on s@@ RGB . if you work as in the colour space of s@@ RGB , you must either c@@ alli@@ br@@ ate your monitor to the s@@ RGB , use an appropriate monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore use it before attempting any further manual processing .
the functions Norm@@ alize , Fig@@ ure , Automati@@ cally adjust and contrast from the Con@@ duc@@ ting Autom@@ atic correction attempt to automatically make the best of your colors . you &apos;ll need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the brightness values over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest spot are as bright as possible without changing its colour shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed .
synchron@@ ization : this method adju@@ sts the brightness factor of the color of the selected image so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity canal is as flat as possible . it sometimes produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in an image or destro@@ ys it .
automatic synchron@@ ization : this method maximizes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it detects the dark and light border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram field .
enhance contrast : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ ous intensity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a new ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible in washed pictures and can be a good correction for poor photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is somewhat limited since it is used over a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by copyright by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side , both the original image as well as the preview of the target image can be seen . the preview is dynamically adapted to the tool &apos;s settings . if you want to see the original white balance , then click on the sub @-@ window .
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel below this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
at the top right , a hist@@ ogram is shown that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well @-@ lit pictures , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment allows you to improve or down@@ grade the shadow details of your photos .
to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . this type also automatically sets the temperature and green values .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of preferences . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the color when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result in white balance . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons to save and load exactly this . each adjustment of the white balance you have set allows you to save it in a text file and load it later .
the default settings button sets all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed .
you can set the code depth for each color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better for high @-@ quality pictures . however , this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color @-@ mapping can be performed by the sub @-@ window for the brightness . a detailed guide for using color profiles allows you to rate the chapter colour management .
this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to save multiple color channels simultaneously . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same error and therefore always need the same correction . in the manual for sound correction you will find further information .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you will find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool colour effects provide you with four color effects , a sol@@ dering effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , solar ion@@ ization , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that was created when using a partially developed pressure of a short flash light and then completed the development of the image . this had the effect that the bri@@ ghter areas darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . this tool allows you to fine tune this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the solar ion@@ ization . at approximately 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment eventually creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and it processes the ( 2 ) . applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simply , it beauti@@ fies many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very satisfied colors in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repe@@ ats the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images the filter can load the whole CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is not unusual to correct the color contrast and the brightness of the photo . you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview .
when you make a photo in poor lighting conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a too big satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . any changes you can perform can be seen in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the instrument clay correction is based on the improvement of exposure . even if the dialogue with this tool works very complicated , you only need the area of the slider for the application purpose described here .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected range . below the graph , three slide rules are cli@@ cked into and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to operate is to move the controller and watch out how the image changes .
on the right side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be updated dynamically , using the settings of the image , updated . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be adjusted if the hist@@ ogram is displayed using a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic division is more useful .
three controllers : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle sounds , often called g@@ amma values .
the three color pin@@ pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , middle and light tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic alignment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls that can be used to change the output values as interactive as with the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a ble@@ ached image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set according to the intensity values of the image .
save and load : with these buttons , the set values in the fil@@ esystem can be saved and loaded later . to do this , the Gim@@ p Levels format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values will be adjusted automatically for all shadows , means and sun shades . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ ous channels .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all colour channels in order to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below you see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modified channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera is usually the linear mode of the most meaningful . for images with large areas of a constant color , the linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move a short@@ wave to the right , e.g. the bright tones , you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and darker image pixels are darker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see . if you shift this marker to the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve that you have created can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
when using this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons , automatically create the curve control points for all channels of shadow , mid@@ - and sun shades . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ ous curve .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if you find over@@ exposed pixels in more than one channel , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing is a tool for improving the colour channels or changing the colour shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the Color channel mixer of the image processing .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed by comparison with one &apos;s own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are shown in the right corner : control for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you enable L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will also retain the overall brightness as the channel mixer then is the tool to create great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a colour leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space . the colour space consists of small noise files that do not appear at the same spot in the colour channel , and their noise pattern in each channel looks different . if that is the case , you can improve your Mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion in which you will reduce the color space first .
the storage and loading buttons are used for this purpose . any mixer setting can be saved later and then loaded . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all colour channels in order to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was read@@ ju@@ sted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed picture below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step because color images can be converted easily on the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green l@@ enti@@ l filter . this looks good , with all the scenery pictures and fits particularly well with portraits against the sky .
orange @-@ filtered : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange @-@ filtered .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this produces dramatic sky effects and can simul@@ ate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at the time of the day . so similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ lon@@ aton : produces warm light and middle tones as it adds a bit of cold in the shad@@ ow@@ ls . this is very similar to the process of the appearance of a pressure and the re@@ development in a s@@ qui@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ qui@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the engraving of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : shifting this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper text effect has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool box can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a be@@ holder in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the sc@@ attering eye . in picture frame , the module can be started from image processing .
type : use this parameter to set the desired frame type for your picture . in detail the picture finishes with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce is surrounded by a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and @-@ white pictures ) , bev@@ elled with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be greater than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the pictures , especially if you have used the tool After aspect ratio .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into an image at any location . this also works in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its characteristics as you need it . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background .
every setting you chose for your text can be changed until you press OK . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply mould template you can place a template over a picture .
the menu picture template apply in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture .
for the template , there are no restrictions on size and orientation . however , you need to use the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for reduction of the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to &amp; digi@@ kam , just send an e @-@ mail to the &amp; digi@@ kam ; mailing list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you copied the template files . these settings will be scheduled for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the template , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder automatically updates the template bar of the template automatically .
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink : this button shr@@ inks the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must shrink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image lying under the template . take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then automatically adjust the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional sharpen@@ ing tool . it is very fast and easy , but produces fine gra@@ iny images , especially in dark areas .
bl@@ ur mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . in fact , it sharp@@ ens no bit , it works rather psycho@@ visual . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of three because it really improves sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for custom@@ ization .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images need a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the digital@@ isation process has to be combined with only minimal differences to a colour point . this in turn causes sharp edges to be combined into a common color . the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras usually require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
images in raw format , on the other hand , have to be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners use a focus filter while you read the image . if you disable this , you get control over your image .
in some situations , you can get useful results by bl@@ ur@@ ring a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . you can use the Con@@ duc@@ ing Fol@@ der menu entry .
but you should handle it carefully , as the results do not work very naturally : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also enhances the noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharp@@ ness of an image re@@ focusing the tool . under re@@ focusing you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques of sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than it to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten the soft sign with the menu item Cor@@ rec@@ ise plas@@ tic@@ isers and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or the amount intensi@@ fies the effect . if you make the bl@@ ur mask too strong , h@@ edges and the impression of gr@@ en@@ ades will produce close to sharp edges .
the radius represents how many pixels are affected by the filter on each side of a edge . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , they should best shar@@ pen pictures in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped image that is added to the original . thereby the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference @-@ amount . in this way , areas with a soft change between the sounds are excluded from the shar@@ per and therefore avoid beauty errors in faces , skies and water surfaces .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp mas@@ ked filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image the ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the &amp; nbsp ; tool re@@ focusing a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted Det@@ ox @-@ Filter algorithm of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ tr@@ ation . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a bl@@ ur mask .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the g@@ auss &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result also depends on the source pix@@ ies that are far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the F@@ IR Vienna In@@ verse of the G@@ auss &apos;s folding is also very strongly influenced by the distant pixels . this causes un@@ desirable results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures the default value should yield 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad .
g@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the g@@ auss . use this parameter when your sharp@@ ness is wrong . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
mat size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the g@@ auss . note , however , that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad Buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any more focused parameter that you have set will then be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try out all blan@@ ks , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise . the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not visible immediately , but later leave un@@ pleas@@ urable art@@ ef@@ acts .
if you read and comp@@ ress pictures , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , non @-@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by bl@@ urred mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the sharp@@ ness . for the Vienna filter one can show that it is the optimum linear filter . practical , the result of the F@@ IR @-@ Vienn@@ ese filter is always at least as good as the un@@ sharpen@@ ed mask . the F@@ IR Wiener Filter is often better when processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied to a small un@@ focused image :
this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the lens lens .
for more information on the methods of sharp@@ ness in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the regulator smoo@@ thes the bl@@ ur@@ ring of the area that has been dark@@ ened in order to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink mist provides a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , then you can adjust this here .
the tool error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove un@@ desired art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting Algorith@@ m was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool contains different preferences as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pre @-@ settings are listed below :
if you want to fine tune the filter settings , you can use the Ri@@ der smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
details War@@ ning p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to a smooth smoo@@ thing over the picture . whereas larger values are mainly smoo@@ ther than homogen@@ ous regions and details are sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should keep details in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards .
alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes evenly in all directions , while a value close to 1 only smoo@@ thes in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ul@@ ator or CCD noise , a high value is generated with wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG arti@@ facts are best removed at a value near 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore set this value matching to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if very much noise is present , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ lion effect it needs to be set higher than 3 .
repeat : speci@@ fies how often the algorithm is passed . usually 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle step @-@ wide da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is chosen small , it should also be chosen small . make sure that small angles produce a long run@@ time . so you should be able to make this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de length in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never exceed 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation Use : the more quality you receive by selecting this option is only low . it doubles the duration . we therefore recommend it to skip it .
the buttons save as and load exactly this . correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button Canc@@ el .
below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied in a photo that has been made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a peculiar black arti@@ fact in the background that caused by a bad film storage during the trip . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stains and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings window can remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time that the filter per pixel needs and can bl@@ ur the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and thus smaller errors corrected .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing the filter looks forward to detect lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be obtained and noise or lubrication occurs again .
edges : controls edge accuracy for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , it can not remove all the noise , or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend changing either color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend changing either color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas , which are typically stronger , but it also al@@ erts the shadow areas .
atten@@ u@@ ation : controls the adjustment of the phase grid atten@@ u@@ ation . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the lumin@@ ance density . if it is elevated , the edges appear smoo@@ ther when it is too high .
save and load : these buttons are used for that purpose . all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much simpler than a picture to shar@@ pen . use this tool to sof@@ ten the soft sign with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ise plas@@ tic@@ isers and experiment with the smoo@@ thing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the digi@@ cam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove g@@ auss &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ulation , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that appear in digital , original or later digit@@ alized images .
the same algorithm can be used for color and texture substitution . the texture ratio is performed with a different tool , the image error correction . the restoration algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Artef@@ acts : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a loss @-@ prone compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ ac@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed picture . this setting should correct these problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the buttons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Save &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Download &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make exactly this . any hi@@ ring of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and loaded later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time by pressing the button .
below you can be restored like a photo with uniform noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious movie selection on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were applied to an old color photograph taken with a scanner . you can see the scan @-@ art@@ ef@@ acts created by scanner illumination and the photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows hot@@ pixel images to be removed with a CCD camera gem , eight . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel &amp; quot ; and quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark picture sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual way to select the bad pixel .
load this file into the wizard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark picture to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel . note that the wizard shows the last dark image and will automatically load it in the next session .
the image area and preview help to correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixels are highlighted in all preview areas .
select an area to view the defective pixels on preview and results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixels . these are the filters available :
average cut : an average of the neighbor pixels is determined . the resulting color will be assigned to all faulty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn into the calculation of a bi @-@ linear interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the faulty pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the faulty pixels in the block .
below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and a long exposure . the original image has been magni@@ fied to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in the medium and large photo format , can often not equally illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which makes it impossible to hold the camera by hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center @-@ filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise un@@ shar@@ per effects are caused by movement .
it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter using the large coating area of today &apos;s film and film scanner , using an equivalent transformation on a raw image without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applies the transformation with a C@@ enter@@ filter to a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three more exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the level of light absorption at the point of the largest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , resulting in an optical filter with aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 , .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to re @-@ adjust the exposure of the target image with these options .
if you want a fin@@ er read@@ ju@@ sting of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distortion can not be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree covers the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third grain has a similar rounded effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of fourth gra@@ des adju@@ sts the distant verti@@ ces to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be virtually eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of distortion of the second degree . with negative values , distortion @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distortion of the fourth degree . this value affects the edges more strongly than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner &apos; has the reverse sign of the parameter &apos; General &apos; .
zoom : this value res@@ izes the image size , resulting in a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
clear : this value adju@@ sts brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog provides a preview of the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are stored and used as default values at the next start .
the ton@@ n@@ - and cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or scale changes . if you cut a picture anew and then perform a ton@@ ne @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be apparent to the groove .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal relief line . move it to an important place , such as the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the sp@@ her@@ ical distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting picture will have black corners . you can remove them with the cutting tool in the Transform@@ able Cut out of the image processing or via the Zoom control of this dialog .
the next logical step for some subjects such as pictures from front , frame and painting is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture are 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with the hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the ton@@ ical correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate the infr@@ a @-@ red feature of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org web page that is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known underground ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ Infr@@ ared @-@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can adjust two parameters for film gra@@ ining and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option Add film gran@@ ulation if you want to simul@@ ate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO control changes the amount of film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in conversion . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel it makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos because the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the peak lights .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter Film Cor@@ rection is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool for re@@ producing film gran@@ ulation on your pictures . this is known by classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X .
the film gra@@ ining effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street @-@ photographic , gra@@ iny view especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter .
with the regulator , the ISO @-@ sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film gra@@ ding effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance as an oil painting . natural pictures and still life are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper chooses the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large images . smoo@@ thing controls the smoo@@ thing or , viewed from the other side , the sharp@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the processor is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel large picture is 1 and smoo@@ thing 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a cab@@ bage @-@ ze . pictures whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you had chosen to sketch out for you .
there are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pen size and the lower knob adju@@ sts the contrast ( smoo@@ thing ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; digi@@ kam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; Filter Gra@@ ur shapes your picture in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter Gra@@ ur is a fast tool to restore your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure , in which color is not the most important thing . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ oton@@ ous landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filter . a value of 30 , equal to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : spl@@ its the image into cells and makes it look like it is seen through glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 , the image is distorted with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects any time with the button Stop .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using sharp@@ ness effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharpen@@ ed : bl@@ urs the image along with star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center point . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a zo@@ om@@ able camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al Un@@ sharpen@@ ing : bl@@ urs the image by turning the pixels to a center . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
distance sharp@@ ness : bl@@ urs the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to be back in the background .
motion bl@@ ur : bl@@ urs the image by horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train , camera .
sof@@ tening Un@@ sharpen@@ ed : bl@@ urs the picture sof@@ tly in the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this produces photos with a dream and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton Eff@@ ect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or to add a warm and subtle glow .
sharp@@ ness : bl@@ urs the image by random@@ ly shifting the pixels and thus simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent Un@@ sharpen@@ ing : finds the Far@@ sink in the picture and bl@@ urs them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then recre@@ ates it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Stop .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make rain drops to your picture . this gives it natural to your images a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of dro@@ pl@@ ets . fish eyes changes the optical effect of dro@@ pl@@ ets on the picture .
you can with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing an area free of rain drops . use the selection tool to choose the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter drop drops , the area will remain free of rain drops .
this is an example of the rain drops filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) suggests a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can put it in the right direction by mirr@@ oring or turning it into the right direction . you can find the tools in the Trans@@ former Rot@@ ate or Trans@@ former M@@ irr@@ ors menu .
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate an image and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you re@@ invent the missing information or guess ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good work . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size change . choose to change size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
the tool to size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approxim@@ ate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try the tool to blow up .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ ated was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in tab New Size and are listed below :
maintaining aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if very much noise is present , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ lion effect it needs to be set higher than 3 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Buttons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Store &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; buttons are used exactly to do this . enlarge each entry for photo can be saved as a text file and then loaded again later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Be@@ enden .
you can see below an example of photo bubbles by enlar@@ ging a small image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement .
to cut a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together an image . to cut a photo you simply need to create the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle , creating . you will see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by drawing at the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle can be created simply by using the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button The blan@@ king button of image editing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the Save File or Save File in the File menu to save the newly edited photo .
in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog is preserved .
in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as portrait format or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of height and width is assigned to the width .
the tool After aspect ratio crop use a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches , inches or any other physical size . you can see , for example , a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog , you can use the Max . ratio button to cut the area for cutting to the greatest possible depending on the chosen relationship and orientation .
when you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image measurements are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the composition assistance settings allow you to hide help so that you can put together your pictures better . these aids are :
harmonic triangle : harmonious divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third organ , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle into a similar harmonious tri@@ angles on the diag@@ on@@ als .
golden center : the golden mean is a division that relies on different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the blades of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we perceive as beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . , where each number is equal to the sum of its two preceding numbers .
the golden center provides more fluid relief lines when you put together an image . these aids are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ al will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition guides the viewer &apos;s gaze along the lines of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow in this way .
one more rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . this rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . it should give something that the eye is directing to the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the golden tri@@ angles also deri@@ ve from the golden spiral discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to these lines can be released a static object more dynamic .
when you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise .
the options Horiz@@ ontal flip and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions .
with the color button you can set the color of the help lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the lines can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to turn a picture around any angle .
this creates a picture where things are turned around an angle . this creates a picture where things are turned around an angle . you can do this with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing and the tool free rotation . choose to transform Free Rotation and adjust the destination angle .
rotate your image with the slider angle . the values on this slide are given in degrees . with the pres@@ et button you can set the slide back to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is displayed on the right side of the window .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
once you have turned a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair this is to use the function Transform@@ ieren zu@@ cch@@ ette from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the automatic cut function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the image a bit after rotation . however , keep in mind the above warning .
all perspective trans@@ formations are performed around a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog , you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by transformation , in pixels .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right below : indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image is lubri@@ cated a little . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments produce a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you &apos;ve adjusted the perspective you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the picture with trans@@ former cutting out of the image processing .
this is not rotation , the image becomes distorted . in other words , a rect@@ angle turns into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module through transformation sciss@@ ors .
if you press Pre@@ ferences , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane .
to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are bl@@ ended . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sc@@ aling , the image is bl@@ urred a bit . for a single gra@@ ding , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two ch@@ ords create twice as much inter@@ ruption and therefore you should avoid this .
after the coating , the picture has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with trans@@ former cutting out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , of the way these libraries have been compiled .
because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF under it .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; displays only files in formats to which you know . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of it with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you will be able to change this list of file extensions .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia .
image compression is the application of data compression methods to digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG with the same compression ratio .
if you want to learn more about the raw picture format , watch Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam . in the configuration section you will find further information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports loading of raw images only with the d@@ cra@@ w program , which is included in &amp; digi@@ kam . with this , more than 200 raw data formats are supported . all supported cameras can be seen at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ;
many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often stored in the AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG format ; but is not a film editing program and therefore does not have any built @-@ in possibilities to view or edit movies .
go forward to the previously visited album in the chron@@ icle . you can only go forward once you have gone back .

K@@ IP@@ I module , which exports a number of images into a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth .
if you swap the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four adjustments with the white balance module .
many tools you need the photo processing are in &amp; digi@@ kam ; your description will follow here .
all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , plas@@ tic@@ iser , noise suppression , re@@ focusing , un@@ sharp mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; Tex@@ tile application quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter on the current image . links of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview area .
horizont@@ ally , without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper part shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizont@@ ally . the upper part shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ M@@ ouse over &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that can be switched on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . used colors can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the picture and place it on the part of the picture from which you want to see the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the option to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are scheduled .
the Properties page shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely self explan@@ atory . it is grouped in the following sections :
photo properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data originate from EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini program . you can move in or zoom with the mouse wheel or move it . push C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to pull a square . all images inside these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pallets files . the application can be used for editing colour pal@@ ettes and selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the pallets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders according to files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line in the palette view . it can be moved by clicking the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described under the palette view . here , the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to select select . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the Com@@ m Cur@@ sor box is enabled under the color button , the color will be inserted from the color table at the cur@@ sor . the color will either be inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the over@@ write mode is selected .
a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used along with the actions of copying , cutting and past@@ ing .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line end character , if another color follows .
the colors in the palette and the output of the color sel@@ ector can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color sel@@ ector on the left side .
graph@@ ene is a K@@ DE program for viewing and graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ Gra@@ ph . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . until now , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs that include &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are listed according to the program author &apos;s opinion &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ og@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphs viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing and graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphs ; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; Po@@ sters ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph in &amp; posters ; re@@ comp@@ utes the graph and represents in &amp; k@@ graphs ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; posters ; to open or open the graph in &amp; k@@ top@@ viewer ; in a
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems from about 1000 no@@ des and a h@@ ack to show more than these k@@ not )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for displaying graphs . required in detail :
the main window displays the opened graph , each in a separate sub @-@ window . at first , if you start &amp; c@@ alli@@ viewers , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar only open the symbol file and the ( empty ) list will open all opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files , the main window looks like in the bottom screen shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; old ; button ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file is currently being changed by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph should be rel@@ o@@ aded or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; c@@ alli@@ viewer ; can also remember your decision , so that later it will proceed . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item settings k@@ graphs ; set up ... , see also .
if you want to open a graph@@ ite file outside an ongoing &amp; k@@ graph viewer , eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice of whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; instance , or want to represent the over@@ loaded graph@@ ene in a sub @-@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice in a long time , but you can also change it later with the setup dialog .
when you start the program , you can open all the graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how to divide the graph to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely .
if you are using multiple pages , you can choose whether the sections of the graph coming to one page should be adjusted to this page . in doing so , the aspect ratio is ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph .
page preview with one Gra@@ ph distributed on several pages without head@@ line and with a different font
the Renew@@ able Shop page gives the option to specify behavior when a file has been changed to the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or ask the program each time .
the opening gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphs ; if a graph is opened outside a current session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time it is asked .
the session management page gives the possibility to specify the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or un@@ zip files from the last session or not ) or decide to be asked for each start .
the context menu , which usually appears on one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , opens up further possibilities :
here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . entries as described on the web site of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directed graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered representations of directed graphs . the algorithm places edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge over@@ laps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ ic@@ ited graph@@ ene . it produces representations according to the spring@@ form model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm generates a spring@@ board model for un@@ eri@@ zed graphs . it uses the Fru@@ ct@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ g@@ utter for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm orders the node circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
open a dialog in which you can specify a layout command that will then be executed by a shell . the command should display the graph file as parameters , and output the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can type &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms specific options , or also change the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph ( directed or executed ) and applies the default algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ eri@@ ed graphs ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview is displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
displays what is the mouse cur@@ sor . click on a &amp; GUI ; element to get more help on this element ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source file of the source repository .
&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools for display . it requires the following program packages :
a special device is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graphs ; in the Settings menu , you will find further options .
the main window of the icon editor is divided into five sections : the main tool@@ bar , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette and the grid in which you draw the symbol .
create a new icon . once the current file has been changed , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the changes . then a dialog appears in which you can choose if the symbol is to be created by a template , or whether you want to start anew from scratch .
reset the last step . if you do not have a step backwards , this function will be disabled .
adds the cli@@ p@@ board content as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in grey levels . this can create colors that do not match those of the symbol range of &amp; k@@ de ; match .
does not change the icon , but sets the current character color to the color of the point on which you click .
the status bar displays the current actions . from left to right , it shows you the x@@ - and y coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current drawing area , the magni@@ fication factor and the current number of colors of the symbol .
adds the cli@@ p@@ board content as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
open with Settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up a dialog with the three sides templates for symbols , background and symbol grid .
with the buttons Add ... , Edit ... and Rem@@ ove , you can change the templates for Standard File , Source File , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc .
choose Transpar@@ ent pixels , insert a ruler , and insert one color : or a ch@@ ess@@ board as a transparency ad . you can also set the size : the cart on small , medium and large as well as color 1 : and color 2 : choose .
read the K@@ IP@@ I module pictures to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that is supported by the San@@ e project or another source such as video streams . to do this you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the menu item images , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to fetch the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by replacing the default values duc@@ er to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before using the button Scan the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find further information .
make sure the window is completely displayed , as some settings may not be displayed .
after you have pressed the Scan button you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window to set the options of the target image appears . here you can specify the compression and type of the image file . please remember that type BM@@ P does not comp@@ ress and therefore create very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image .
screen shots can be created after you have selected in the Import &gt; screen shot menu . a window appears in which you can adjust the various screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ des :

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools to loc@@ alize images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itude and lati@@ tude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data , you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ d you can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears . to get a possible correlation of time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file .
when the file loads , an automatic correlation is performed that shows the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and so the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done using the time zone .
the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera distance . if the devi@@ ation below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have track data from a location for pictures you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
inter@@ pol@@ ing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have matching data . if you know that in reality there is a location in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the cor@@ relate button to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog will remember the coordinates of one call to the next you just have to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and placed with the displayed map . choose the region and enlarge it . guide this over and over again until you reach a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be changed between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to ensure the best possible internation@@ alization .
the selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . you just need to select these albums . the three buttons on the right hand side you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below you will see the Al@@ ben@@ preview and the text that appears in the head of the HTML page .
the rider &apos;s appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the picture will be displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default picture viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show
the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all of your associated images . choose a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images .
with other color depth , you can change the default color depth , which of course also influences file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory .
the tab preview images allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window displays the user how far the action is . click Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . therefore , you can read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during production . the web browser will automatically be started to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
the K@@ IP@@ I viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform on them basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and folders . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is shown as default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality and metadata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases as no compression of the color information is taking place . this can be found , for example , at the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool for you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Met@@ adata Editor does not currently have any documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere but not write into each target format . JPEG is supported while writing . please check out ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in form of a slide show .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the pack@@ ets M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show .
all images are sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the chosen video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XV@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . then you can start to create the module via Extras MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au .
the images selected by you are then listed among image files in the Portfolio . there you can also change the pictures or the content of the list .
after you are happy with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , XV@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to play the file on a TV , you need to select the corresponding TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates a very sudden , high contrast , very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave them black . you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file . keep the extension prompt as possible .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it is integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all settings to your wishes , you can start coding the production of the movie with the button encoding . depending on the speed of your computer you can quickly or quietly enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide show when you are back .
if a hint appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages above the button settings in the lower right corner .
the print assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. useful to improve or print directly with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W format in one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ p ! .
first select the RA@@ W file to convert and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window then appears in the mode for a single image . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines if the camera settings are to be used for white balance . the main parameters like G@@ amma , Bright@@ ness and Red / Blue Amp@@ li@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected to enable you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name stays the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tagged image format , TI@@ FF , keeps all the information of your image and uses the loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you plan to edit your pictures frequently or later use them otherwise , you should not choose the JPEG format as it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as a memory format , the metadata contained in the RA@@ W file is stored in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the exec@@ uting button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el .
batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at a time . therefore , use this mode when you are safe , e.g. by testing in a single image which is the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing file automatically . this is helpful if it was created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck Package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck Package . you can make the image smaller or enlarge .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : res@@ izing in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option , for example , to adjust your picture to the screen format .
not proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
print Pre@@ par@@ ation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be used before .
after you have started the module , the picture window is displayed with the selected pictures . you can add more images using the button Add images . for the last selected image , a preview will be shown on the right .
you can also drag the images onto the picture list and place them there to add the list of images to be sent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rem@@ ove &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button , the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after you have selected all the images you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client using the OK button . you only have to add the addresses and the subject here . the pictures selected by you are already attached as attachments .
don &apos;t forget to send too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of e @-@ mails to be sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple emails when you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending images . your configuration is saved and used every time you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments will be added to the images in a text file and added to the mail .
the P@@ NG format under the File Format@@ s menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted among the loss@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG in images file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original copy data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not be automatically closed to view the status messages , in search of errors . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . with the button closure you can close this window .
after starting the Advanced Di@@ ash@@ au module , a window will appear with questions like you want to display your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album .
the Open@@ GL option in the presentation uses very elegant visual transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , as otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the fil@@ en@@ ame option displays the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images in the lower left corner of the presentation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an infinite loop . you can then manually dis@@ connect with Es@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the possibility to select pictures random@@ ly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of the images in the album .
the distance between the images can be set between the images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect .
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select . random@@ ly , each transition from the images chooses a different effect .
during the slide show you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on .
with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide show .
on the lower left side of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting a picture as background image for the working surface .
this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected sub@@ menu option , as background for your K@@ DE working surface .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; Browse these , see the picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , are now available in each group , i.e. in people , places and in the group keywords .
in the browser window , you can see the categories for which you typ@@ ed information as you have provided your pictures and videos with notes . additionally there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course look at the current preview images .
if you hit the characters with the mouse , the browser view changes . see the picture .
if you select another person only the images displayed on which both persons can be seen . through this selection method , you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few single images .
if you have selected all the people , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of activity .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person a separate thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself . see the picture below .
in order to display images next to the names , select the button located right outside on the tool@@ bar . in the appearing context menu you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display symbols with pictures of individuals and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you do not have suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you must decide for yourself which image should be displayed for each individual person . to do this , you need to open the image view window ( described in more detail ) and displayed in the context menu of the category Editor . here you can select the image for the respective person . in the view window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and by selecting which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
if you call the search in the main window , a dialog will show you that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog once more .
if you enter a string in the label or description , the descriptions or descriptions of the images will be searched after this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can either be part of the total date , e.g. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all the images according to specific names as you can see in the picture . here , according to pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user &apos;s manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like reading manuals , but rather want to try some functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduction videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry for the first time , or select the menu entry for the first time , and you can download the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , see the tim@@ eline . you can see a picture of this bar here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you date statistics on the pictures in your database .
the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each bar then shows another unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 minutes .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image will show you the current date in the preview panel ) and in addition , the tim@@ eline displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview pane .
you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , so the time data . if you select an area , you will only see images of this time frame in the preview pane . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides two ways to create HTML websites with your images . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is described ; built @-@ in version that you can create through the menu File ...
before HTML pages are created you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and target . in the following , each section is described more precisely .
first , enter the title of the overview and a description that the HTML file should contain later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages , you can see an example of these settings .
next , select if you want to create a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file to be viewed on the overview page .
finally , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed to the viewer without description . for example , that all images are from a party . note that all pictures are from a party .
in this section you can set how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why this is not specifically addressed .
on the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this means that those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not download any images that , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewers of your page can change the resolution at any time you have specified . so , you can browse your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transfer time . if you want to get a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
the best way to select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder is saved and automatically added to the location next time . this allows you to set the location for all future images . here you can select either a folder or a K@@ DE @-@ supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if they are all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser will start after the pages are created . the URL you set here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are still not in the final destination folder , you have to manually copy them to it . so the import function , see , properly works you need to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the just described settings have all three based on base folders and URLs . a sub@@ folder is created in these , whose name will be specified in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you might want to share your pictures with these . however , if you have already spent a lot of time viewing the picture information , people on the pictures , location , etc . , then you must with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are exported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in the fact that the images themselves are stored in the file or whether there is only one link to images in the file . the advantage of all images in the file is that you have all the images together and can share this file as independent . however , the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File Export ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images two times . first , it searches the images that are in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding pictures are not found , then the images of the URL you have entered when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML @-@ Export .
in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting pictures is described , which you can access via the Export menu ...
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
with the option Manu@@ ell to copy to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
copy &amp; paste the images automatically to the .@@ k@@ im file with the option Automati@@ cally in the vicinity of the .@@ k@@ im file .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zi@@ p files . since most of the images were already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so , simply select the Export File option .
the last option of this page is maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Im@@ ported ... select , will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in .
the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folders the im@@ porting images should be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category people of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is in your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog box to import which categories of the file to be imported and which categories it matches in your database .
in the fourth step , you can offset the categories of the file to be imported using the categories of your current database .
it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump inside of different picture groups &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; if you want to see pictures of your Italy vacation and discover an image with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will pass the various steps of ( 1 ) Deter@@ mining information about your images , through ( 2 ) the browsing and viewing , through to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
Photo@@ Album has started as a program to manage your pictures , but it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos too . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this also includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file in the top folder of your images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in the CV@@ S , where you want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; records the folder in which your images are stored and used this in future starts automatically . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , then you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with option -@@ c . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
through the menu entry Pre@@ ferences col@@ photo@@ album ; setup ... go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , you will explain the different settings options .
to the left you see six different symbols , with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting a detailed help is available , which can be accessed by pressing a button on the F1 key and clicking on the desired option .
this describes how you can set different properties for each image , for example persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
view the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the dialog options you can set up complete groups of members , i.e. , for example , all members of a group at one time in a group instead of explaining all groups of a link like in .
in the list you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface .
modules can and will not be described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can call via the module itself .
since the modules are used together with one another , it may be that modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album have been tested very little . therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own pictures . demo database can be accessed either through the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t tell me , I wouldn &apos;t have warned you !
the applications that the modules use via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album do not work . this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications can arrange their images in albums : an album is simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order for some modules to use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all the pictures that show you the picture preview at the moment .
in addition to the current album , a list of albums has to be handed over to the modules . here goes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the contents of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category people , it will be &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do so if you would have selected people to view and pass it on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select modules to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen when you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are accustomed to from any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . under the tool@@ bar , you will see the window with which you can browse your image database . at the moment , we will find no information about your pictures yet . in the section we will look back on this window , now click on the entry pictures showing you an overview with all existing pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to provide any picture with notes . this includes information about the persons who are shown on the picture where the picture was taken . you can set any picture either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if for example , shown on all pictures Jes@@ per and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these ann@@ ot@@ ations when using the built @-@ in viewer .
you can see three lists with a text box by assign@@ ing people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you can always use them again whenever you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is based on shifting the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and are shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can , by moving the names used upwards , find people faster and arrange them .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the sorting button on the list .
if you have selected comments for each image individually , you may want to edit all selected pictures and add ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case , simply click on the above and back buttons , which are under the preview of the picture to the right .
if you have received multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to select all these images and use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the US . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California .
the picture shows a browser window that shows the USA as a super@@ group . to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the ann@@ ot@@ ation dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category . in addition , you can simply drag an entry to a category and place it there to make this entry into a sub@@ category of this entry . note that you just sort your categories in alphabe@@ tical order .
you can move the single elements of the ann@@ ot@@ ation dialog by clicking and moving the bars that form the top edge of the frame . you can also make your own window from a frame by drawing it outside the window area .
if you have adjusted the appearance of the window so adjusted to your needs , click on the options ... that offers you the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also completely fade out a frame . if you want to see this window later , use the button Options ... and click here to fade out . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the image in the browser , you will get an overview of thumb@@ nails of the currently selected pictures , or of all images in case you do not set filters . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button . try it again .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture will be set as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this is displayed in the image viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Rem@@ ove button or select Del@@ ete in the Edit menu . now the window will show you that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for example , images can be used without you having saved to the hard disk . of course you must have saved the pictures somewhere so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album can be recorded in the database index . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all needed pictures can be loaded from the hard disk .
images , in which the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard drive . however , for the images 5 @-@ 9 the thumb@@ nails are present so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album can show you the preview of these images . however , you can not view these images with the image viewer .
as you can see , this feature requires you to copy and copy files from the folders and copy it back . if you want to avoid hass@@ le @-@ ing @-@ ying of your images , please buy a larger hard drive to store all the images on it .
in the Pictures menu , you can find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end of those you want to make accessible to others and click on Current View in the Privacy menu . alternatively , you can also control all the pictures that your little sister can see , control and block the menu item Any@@ thing out of the current view .
with this you have set out which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you want to give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , so all the images you have locked can be hidden . if you want to get the pictures displayed again , click Lock .
it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered for un@@ locking the images . to set up this password , simply choose password change in the privacy menu .
please keep in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all images on the hard disk and on the other hand can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection only serves to deny the view to private images .
the reason you spend all of your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to consider them sometime . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album has a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you . of course he shows the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter through the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the info box on top of the picture you want to see , you can easily drag it with the mouse and put it elsewhere . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed at all . all these options are available right click on the viewer .
if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you load multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the button image high and down . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus .
a very useful ability of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
if you can use the viewer , you can move in the image and zoom out . for zo@@ oming , you can simply pull up a rect@@ angle with the mouse . the plus key zo@@ oms in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button you can zoom back your zoom , so that the image will not be zo@@ omed . with the tie @-@ key , zoom the zoom , so that each pixel is on the screen of a pixel of the image . &quot; &quot; &quot;
note that the only zo@@ oming operations that work with videos are in and out with the plus and minus key .
with the revol@@ ving functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work for videos . you can add comments to the current image with the menu item Rem@@ arks from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can view that and open configuration dialog of the image to enter these names .
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you see one after the other .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to provide images with features while viewing them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in view , you can see a picture in which the characteristics A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your images , they are available to you in the browser . so if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , just tag all at once with notes . this is described in . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in preview view . if you can view categories in dre preview view , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case you will allow you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album to paint on the picture .
the batch is not stored with the image , but stored in the database . in this way you can reverse your common later .
in order to view the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , select on the image from the context menu . to end the painting , just press the cross in the tool@@ bar top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you absolutely have read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is represented in the wire model views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the sub @-@ object of an already selected object , since all sub @-@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click either on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu item in the menu In@@ sert .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop down menu will be displayed to enable you to choose the right position :
by del@@ eting either from the menu bar , or from the right @-@ click context menu , you can remove previously selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to App@@ ly these changes . if you entered invalid values , a message with an error description will be displayed . then you can rec@@ tify the input errors and click App@@ ly again or disc@@ ard the changes with Canc@@ el .
when you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; Reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can view a preview in the property view .
press Pre@@ view in the Properties view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a sub @-@ arranged element ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross local .
the screen@@ shot shows the camera &apos;s control points . you can drag the control points with the mouse button , thereby changing the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse inside the entire window .
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can indicate this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher @-@ level object or as an absolute value . objects are displayed only when they are selected or their Visi@@ bility level is smaller or equal to the stage of view of the scene chosen in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window order or if you need a different arrangement , you can set them as desired . you can also store multiple window orders and switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window over or below a view , drag the An@@ f@@ asser to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the user to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , drag the An@@ f@@ asser in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the flash@@ cards at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . in order to resolve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the An@@ f@@ asser to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the cham@@ fer bar .
to close a view click on the small cross in the bev@@ elled bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views to the main window . in the View menu you can find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any place .
the current window view can be saved with view window layout ... Save . it displays a dialog in which you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene you can render them ren@@ ders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program has to be properly installed . when this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 .
to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering symbol Ren@@ dering the icon rendering in the tool@@ bar or select scene ren@@ ders .
a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full pictures of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or select R@@ ender modes in the View menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but useful is a name that lets you know the properties of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the cross section sub@@ section and enter the image section for rendering into the input fields .
in combination with quality , you can select the properties , the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ user reflection lighting . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel , various errors can arise . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not shown when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better .
when you switch off anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and combines &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling the neighboring pixels with inclusion .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixel exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel .
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are individually followed and tested for further sub@@ divisions . the maximum depth of recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another possibility to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you switch on it@@ tering , changes &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; that calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the associated beams have not hit an object .
opens a new window for displaying &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expectedly ended , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , select the Import menu entry ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not the complete command range of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; . if error messages or warnings occur while im@@ porting , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object to the open text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source text in the editor and drag it to the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can paste source text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also include .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
when you click on Help in the property view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; User Docum@@ entation to the displayed object . here , make the path to your document and the version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example , height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the scene folder , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the view field in the camera view and in the window type features .
you can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
if you cross high details for extended projections , all wire @-@ model views are further divided when the camera uses advanced projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of the perspective and vertical projections . this feature gives better approxim@@ ation for projections , but requires more time to render .
when you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern from two adjustable colors .
when you tick the ground , a bottom is rendered below the objects . the bottom is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern from two adjustable colors .
if you tick box smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window arrangements section , you will explain how to create and save window orders .
drop down sel@@ ector standard window arrangement : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and del@@ eting a selected arrangement with the Del@@ ete button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views for the chosen window arrangement . new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the button remove .
the position of the new window . with new column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anchor the window under the existing window , with tab card you get a flash@@ card view together with the previous view and ho@@ vering the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more accurate knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a sphere on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture .
if you have installed all error @-@ free , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre@@ configured window order :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit menu item . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you create . in particular , you see this in the fourth wire model view ( right bottom ) . this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the content of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the User Docum@@ entation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; you will find further details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera is in the view control points with which you can change the destination point of the camera . simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired position .
when you click the App@@ ly button or push the input button , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( insert infinite bodies ) and size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as ground :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ ly button or the input paste . in the object tree , the new name is displayed immediately .
the wire @-@ model view now also shows the level , although at the moment only as a fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the level expands to the horizon .
when you look at the object tree , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor when clicking on the symbol + before the object . in this case you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the bottom to the exercise one unit below the horizontal line , only to get to know some of these parameters . choose shift and adjust the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment .
in both cases , a dialog opens where you can select how the object should be inserted . please select first sub @-@ object . the pigment is then displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( Name = bottom pig@@ ments ) , with a click on the button preview see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the pigment preview only shows a matt black material , because you still need to enter settings for the pigment . keep in mind that you can check the look of materials at any time with one click on preview .
if you do not see any color on the loader and ball , click on the App@@ ly button and then enter the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , these are not the colors you expected . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this even more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select the color in the object tree each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
this step should already be done , as you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you should have already understood it . the ball can be created just as easy as the floor :
in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget the input button or the App@@ ly button ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground as you have shifted the bottom to one unit down .
of course , rendering now results in a strange result : as before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . put a suitable material in the next step .
once you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the ground , give the ball a pigment as a colour :
select first sub @-@ object and change the name for example in sphere Pig@@ ment . click on the Pig@@ ment ball , then select In@@ color and set the values as follows :
but you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish features :
then change the values like in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press the input button .
the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er offers ; hopefully you &apos;ve learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene the ren@@ derer shoots hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) by each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog will impact .
as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a source of light , you don &apos;t see anything , the picture is just black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be stored in the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and storage space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . any changes since the last saved release are disc@@ arded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you haven &apos;t saved any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last rever@@ ber@@ ated command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used editing .
store the current window layout and open a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the default behavior .
open a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can set default short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option ; change commands or add new commands .
opens a dialog to set the tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option .
a b@@ ump map is a way to simul@@ ate rough surfaces without having to model any diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a dump @-@ map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are created from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further mach@@ ined to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by applying an image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a convenient image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ok@@ ie show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or the Return key .
you can set whether any image should be displayed in your own window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first sign of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if an appropriate file name was found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c ; .
in the dialog Con@@ figuration - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show . in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the key short@@ cuts can be specified for each window .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color , which you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
if this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still have a look at the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image and is especially suitable for a slideshow .
use this option to save &amp; ku@@ ok@@ ie show ; when requ@@ esting the name of the recently opened folder . at the next start , open &amp; ku@@ ok@@ ie show ; this folder in the browser window .
click the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in the window mode the window is larger than the image , the background will be filled with the selected color .
you can set &amp; ku@@ hn show ; so set up that only some of the file types will be displayed , which can also display the program .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determines whether the slide show should begin with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 3 seconds .
the number of repe@@ ats . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider / small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 1 .
change the keyboard short@@ cuts for the different modes of &amp; ku@@ ok@@ ie show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays preview images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
includes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed when no browser window is open .
view the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
open the input field for completion . enter the first character of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ kam ; picture editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image editing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
as the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user contributing his part to at least problems and possible improvements .
this shows a dialogue with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . all required information is already completed , and you can simply follow the instructions to post your message .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions from other users . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
the best way to get involved in &amp; show photo is to join the developer mailing list . guide to the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&amp; show@@ photo ; try to give you as much control over his work sequences as possible . there are many options that make the behavior of &amp; show photo ; change . to access these settings , you must select in the menu Settings menu . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side .
in the area of exposure indicators you can select the color shown when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator was selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colors with what you are supposed to display . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of the show photo ; has a side bar at the right edge , providing important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same page bar in the image editing . you can view them in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; c@@ ann@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that no longer makes it easier to scan and store images .
&amp; Can@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that no longer makes it easier to scan and save images . &amp; c@@ ann@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog to save images or save images immediately in a given folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of the support of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard sc@@ anners can be set on the command line of c@@ ann@@ l@@ ite ; with the command c@@ ann@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner has been specified , then a dialog to select the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; Can@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options particularly .
to scan an image , the user can only start a preview scan and then scan for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
in order to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom in such a way that the entire preview fits into the window .
once the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
when saving a preview in the settings , then the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . when pressed , then the image will be saved and lie ? en leads to a break and you will get back to the main window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens the same name dialog before the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the type such as and c@@ ann@@ l@@ ite ; to select images . open dialog for saving each image opens the dialog before each sc@@ anned picture . if you want to save this automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are stored in the Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder is used as default for the dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change .
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically generated images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric su@@ ff@@ ix of each time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the Help button starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; Can@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE over -@@ Di@@ alogue for &amp; C@@ ann@@ l@@ ite ; . the button Settings shows the dialog for settings and closing can be used to quit &amp; c@@ ann@@ l@@ ite ; .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; use like all other programs ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes . below you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . below you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . you can set up the global keyboard short@@ cuts by right @-@ clicking into the player window and select short@@ cuts ... select .
you may set up existing multimedia buttons to function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands work . this will make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist browser and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de command @-@ line options ; Amar@@ ok additionally has some own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all needed modules are available and use k@@ dialog , so that the user know why a script does not run .
Beg@@ in require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE b@@ ind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template @-@ scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply extend them to the required functions . you &apos;ll quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command ; any K@@ DE installation should be included .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow exec@@ uting external programs and commands . in this way , the ex@@ ec ( ) function is used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason strings are written to the default input of the script . for this reason scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events even if there is no use for it .
configure The script to display the setup dialog . in order to save and load the setup data each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok will set the folder to the folder where all data should be saved .
tra@@ ck@@ Change shows that a new piece is picked up . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions , you may request further information about the new piece ( for example , the metadata or the piece length ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume sign@@ alizes a change in volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the playlist when a user @-@ defined menu item is cli@@ cked . to remove the menu you can use the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script re@@ mo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; it ends , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M signal to the script . this signal should be processed to do , for example , saving data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the selection of amar@@ o@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages correctly .
the main critic has to be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file per@@ missions :
if your script package is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and link to the Wik@@ i script page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; app@@ end . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the Categ@@ ory Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist , instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you just search for a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection Browser and quick search you will find this piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .

da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you shouldn &apos;t have any trouble while comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that can be activated or de@@ activated at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of options available .
for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the System Requi@@ rements section .
activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulty using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the different functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
in addition to the player window , the player window will switch to the playlist in addition to the playlist . if the option is off , only the playlist window will be ange@@ tim@@ g@@ t@@ Ju@@ K ) .
use V@@ oting bar@@ ometer : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the tun@@ eable bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this makes the color scheme being used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
disc@@ ard mood files in the music files : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . if this setting is enabled , the .@@ mood files will be stored on the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok will be started when a browser is required .
other browsers use : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
save play@@ lists when saving , automatically save the current playlist when running &amp; Amar@@ ok ; En@@ able this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist while you exit .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
keep up @-@ to @-@ date pieces visible when changing the play , that the playlist window is up / down to keep the current piece always in the visible window area .
switching to context @-@ browser automatically shows the context browser as soon as the next piece is pi@@ ped .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s Ap@@ pear@@ ance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the font section you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; set by marking of O@@ wn fon@@ ts , the otherwise gray shown section is enabled . you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : playlist window , player window and context browser . click select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the selection of custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and you can set your own color scheme . use the color sel@@ ector shown below for foreground and background color .
reproduction at startup causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the program start , resume play automatically with the piece at the place with which it was stopped at the last stop .
set up the On @-@ Screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is displayed , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click select ... to select the font for the O@@ SD from the dialog . the shadow shadow causes the text to be displayed in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the ability to adjust the O@@ SD colors for let@@ tering and background . clicking on the color spaces opens the dialog for color sel@@ ector . if your own colors are not enabled , the pre @-@ set &amp; k@@ de colors will be used .
the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users , so you can specify on which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the audio card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down field . some drivers still activate further adjustments in this card card .
the card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folders and the type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to search for music files . in order to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes to set how to proceed with the selected folders .
Browse the sub@@ folder as recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to search for music both the crossed and their sub@@ folders .
monitoring changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folder to changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
im@@ porting play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to add all found play@@ lists to your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will then appear in the playlist browser later .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . combination box Dri@@ vers : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further configuration is needed in the sub @-@ window My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l device section is used to set the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on Calcul@@ ator : will enter the machine on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then under port : the network port under which the database is available . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use username : and password : to enter the data needed to connect to the database .
the card load .@@ f@@ m supports the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if necessary .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send play@@ able pieces and update the profile : this setting allows &amp; Amar@@ ok to transmit the names of played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
retrieve similar interpre@@ ts : after activating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok will retrieve a list of similar interpre@@ ters to the one played . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed so ( including the programs included in it , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some features such as the O@@ SD require that your window manager will adhere to the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ escal@@ top@@ .org , so Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will help , for example , trouble . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file by using ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also hang the broken file that caused the crash .
most of the time it is because Tag@@ lib crashes when reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure all of the libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok were compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X then this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable automatic turn off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens if you crash ) . if this is a common crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be resolved .
this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ info , but do not mark it as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error in writing the tags from $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( Rand@@ om mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects will be easily forgotten . note that sometimes up to three times you have to click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : icon look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first .
there are some ways . most installation problems are the easiest way to solve your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the # Amar@@ ok channel .
bug@@ fix is not suitable for searching for help . please only make a mistake there if you have something to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only an empty playlist appears . how do music pieces come inside ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left side and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
in order to keep the surface intuitive , the startup sub @-@ window was converted to the statistics window . you will find it under Extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user , while the points are calculated automatically .
to evaluate pieces , the rating column must be displayed in the playlist . click the title bar of the playlist and select column show rating . click anywhere in the new evaluation column to set the rating for a piece . you can also use the short@@ cuts Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , then press Del on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then choose from Play@@ list Rem@@ ove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and drop it down , just as you would do with other files . that &apos;s how simple it is : - )
in the playlist of the playlist , next to the Add button , you can save the playlist . click on it .
probably missing the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the e@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it using the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach so the real question must be supported by G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ D ? . as you can see , we support almost every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG !
it may ! perhaps you may use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which does not include MP3 decoder in default ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input button
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s off : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card using hardware mix@@ ers ( e.g. S@@ B@@ live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you in finding the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify another sink ( e.g. sink ) .
do not forget that media must be de@@ code first . you can &apos;t just send a MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . gam@@ ers are the best choice for most people if you &apos;re looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS will also de@@ code the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound servers with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ w@@ rap@@ pers su@@ id is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed play . read this bug report . enlar@@ ging the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either you do not use the Arts driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc . ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you will need to register all the components . if you register , register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask at IR@@ C Channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( exit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then , run folder registers , once as system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete all the ff@@ m@@ peg files in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer ( you will find the module folder with you @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run the login register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
please report to our mailing list at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a list of suggestions / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm run with this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you &apos;ll have stopped from the gentle tones of music that you have stopped before going to bed .
how to get the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles when you &apos;re on another computer ?
if a working SS@@ H environment exists , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user &apos;s user name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA file .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + Right button sets a piece in the click sequence into the queue . pressing the input button after searching in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tricky features , but what about the symbol in the system section of the control bar ?
click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; click on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browsers you want to display .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click Audio @-@ CD in the menu . it will open a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading , change to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic coding , take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g .
Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ;
basically , this adap@@ ts the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the play has been played . the more often the piece has been played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result .
you can put the rating for a piece yourself by right @-@ clicking on a column header in the playlist window . then you can change the rating of a piece as well as any other attribute , by selecting the right mouse button on the piece and pressing F@@ 2 . you can also edit the rating in the dialog metadata .
the developers do not want you to tell you when to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that is not to be assembled with the short term set of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying . de@@ activate the option symbol when playing in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool bars ... and make the desired changes there .
download a design down or create your own . install it then under Amar@@ ok ... appearance context browser design , click New Design install ....
the symbol was similar to the War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) logo . to avoid difficulties , it was removed .
Kon@@ quer@@ or &apos;s navigation area allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing in Kon@@ quer@@ or . start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation area . then click the Settings button ( the top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok in the drop @-@ down menu .
audio Stro@@ be is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and password . audio c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and also causes a lot of error reports .
probably has been &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you must &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now i have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules do not appear yet . and now ?
you will need to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . the same goes for x@@ ine , you have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you have to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without linking . a tip by mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module must also be installed .
you get the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play a MP3 stream , but the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and then run it as system administrator logs . then restart Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
setting up Amar@@ ok ... Audio output specify the device . typically , e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound@@ card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; ct@@ l.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; ct@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
insert in the setup dialog by x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick on sound card supported m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts will not be taken care of . you can of course take this problem by yourself ! if you would like , you can become the new so @-@ needed assistants for Arts : )
listening to music should be very simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard , which is displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection afterwards , or simply do not like the wizard , then this Quick Start Guide should help you . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes .

the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that are not available in any other player . but don &apos;t let the full@@ ness of functions deter you , they are all easy to use .
in the navigation area you can find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . in the navigation area you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser .
the context @-@ browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs . the context @-@ browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , Text and Interpre@@ t . these three sub @-@ windows are later added to the details . they provide information on the current piece to different aspects .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you may notice that the sub @-@ window has dropped off . the information shown there has now been distributed to other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in addition , information can be collected in the statistics window ( Extras statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the interpre@@ ters and the album .
the first section in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , performer and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to em@@ ulate the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you will find more information about the current piece . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to display cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng are supported . the context browser will also display cover images that were either downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the Recommen@@ ded pieces are the favorite pieces of this artist . this area shows the five highest scores of the current interpreter .
you can set which information you want to display in the music sub@@ window . just right @-@ click somewhere in the sub @-@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the performer , lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will fold up and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all the pieces in the single areas to immediately start playing . you can also right @-@ click on it and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites with the help of self @-@ written scripts . once you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if not yet a text script is running , you can choose which to start .
the Edit button allows you to edit the song text . the modified version is then saved in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database , and no running text script is required .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com according to the lyrics for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - groups only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are ignored .
this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list among various performers .
group@@ ing Artist / Year - Album - Sor@@ ts to interpre@@ ts and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default is 0 - album name .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are displayed alphabe@@ tically by each other . the performer is ignored .
group@@ ing genre / interpreter - your pieces will be sorted by genre first and then by interpre@@ te .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just as the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the performer .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust and combine group@@ ing at will .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this might take a while .
directly below the tool@@ bar is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . instructions for using this filter can be found in the section for the playlist in this manual .
below the search filter is a selection field with which help you can filter out the last added pieces to your collection . there are several time windows available , starting from the last 24 hours up to one year .
clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection Browser gives you the following options .
load - This will insert the current playlist and add the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play .
attach to play@@ lists - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you can reach the same effect .
set pieces in queue - this function will add the selected pieces to the queue . this will play you next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked by a name under which the list is to be saved .
transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces to the queu@@ es for transferring to the media player . for more details see the section about the Media Player Browser .
burn all pieces of this performer / burn on CD - This means that the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not appear .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialog for piece information and let the tags change for one or more pieces .
move files into the tr@@ ash ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
as a compilation highlight - Select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears under various interpre@@ ters .
set up Mark@@ up - Chan@@ ges as a compilation of marked albums back into a normal album . after that , the album will no longer be shown under different interpre@@ ters , but again under the associated interpreter .
the playlist browser makes it easy to handle many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes smart play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with pieces in your collection that has never been played .
even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click on Intel@@ ligent Play@@ list to open the dialog for creating a new smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player sub@@ window is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by interpreter sort in the top list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list interpreter . if you are done , click App@@ ly . this will add the pieces to your iPod . when the transfer is completed , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and resolve the drive binding for your iPod .
the tool bar is a search field with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser is a address bar with which you can fetch music from a entered URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z , you can access music in the musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z file . now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be tricky by simply dropping down the Shift key . in this case , the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply pulling the entries with the mouse to the desired position . once you enter the characters , only the pieces that contain the characters will be displayed . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter separate search terms by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . if you enter e.g. one two three , the search will find all the entries that contain one , two and three .
for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces that contain one or two or three are found ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you would like to search for entries that contain spaces , close the search term with Gän@@ se@@ fü@@ zes : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that Mike Old@@ field contain , but not for entries like Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you can search even bigger or smaller . for example : evaluation : &gt; 50@@ . This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , put a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something is looking for pieces that do not contain anything .
you can combine these syntax variants at will . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this search for all pieces that either include Mike Old@@ field , or a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bad .
you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then right @-@ click in the desired order on the entries . the entries will then receive a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some features of the playlist . on the left , you will find the Add button you can add to the playlist .
next , undo and restore the buttons . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the tool bar is a unique , enlarged Analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be set with one click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that which you get in the player window on the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s configuration .
there are many more buttons available for the tool@@ bar , for example playback control and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and creating tool@@ bars there ... Select .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . in addition , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval is displayed simply by clicking double in the corresponding display area with the mouse .
you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the status bar option in the general settings .
the context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the playlist in the playlist . via this menu you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
one click on this entry opens the visu@@ alisation plug @-@ in window . there you can select the visu@@ al@@ isations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry there is a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover management is a useful aid to manage your cover images . you can start them by selecting actions cover management in the collection Browser .
the cover management contains a list view of all the albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the performer on the left side .
with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover management . select from :
the queue management got your big entry in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature , you have even more control over the playlist . after you set a piece in the queue , in the playlist , a number will appear next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will be played : 1 will be played first , 2 second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces using the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already presented ( details to set up these sequences later ) .
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add further random pieces while playing .
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio @-@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to work this dynamic playlist .
double click on the playlist , drag it to the playlist window , or right @-@ click on it and then select drawers . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances !
the two pre @-@ set modes of random mix and playlist mix immediately fill your playlist and you can start playback right away . the recommended pieces start with an empty playlist and you have to add at least one piece yourself from your collection . the Recommen@@ ded pieces will be added at the next piece of play , so your playlist will be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , then enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as the starting point . the dynamic mode can also be de@@ activated via the same menu entry .
the New Sync button adds new pieces to the current playlist , adding new pieces to the dynamic mode . editing play@@ lists opens the dialog to edit the playlist , and you can change the appropriate settings .
right click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then , the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings .
enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continuously grow , the setting for incoming pieces will be ski@@ pped , and you will not hear a play twice in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed in the attention of the played pieces .
played pieces - this is the number of played pieces that are to be kept at the beginning of the playlist . thus , you can easily see which pieces were recently played .
this is the number of pieces that should be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 here , the playlist will continuously grow because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right are already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross several play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok will add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists you want .
some scripts make your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then click Con@@ figuration .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; scripts , by clicking on the script . it will open a selection dialog in which a script package can be selected for installation . after you have installed the script , a new entry appears in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .

c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional technology for audio encoding and handling of audio streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and enco@@ der modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( such as MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 enco@@ der module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ h@@ ack Dec@@ oder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . for example , with ff@@ m@@ peg , it is possible to deci@@ ph@@ er W@@ MA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a fully equipped auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used for adjusting the volume of music files to a standard level . this can , for example , make sense to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without a norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces are reproduced differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically return all videos in the CD &apos;s base folder .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the corresponding sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
save the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
saves the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog save under will be shown , with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each single project file .
includes the current project . if a project has been modified and not yet stored , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then choose between saving and changes . you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what to do with it , just as if you were called for each project file .
closes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for any un@@ saved project it is asked what to do with it , as if you had called file clos@@ ings .
when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you entered the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the so @-@ added files appear in the CD &apos;s base folder .
this dialog is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium . burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data .
open the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described via the What is that ? -@@ help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful when you compile files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data from the previous session will always be included , even if this feature is not used . it is intended for you rather than help so that you can view the files and folders available on the medium .
this entry only appears in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
this also allows you to copy a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD that you can then burn later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning instead of a normal copy . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
open the DVD copy dialog . this also allows you to copy a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can only create an image of a DVD , which you can then burn later . furthermore , converting / comp@@ iling a DVD with the help of copying is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to be able to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in its original form .
open the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ R@@ W . this allows you to delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ R@@ W .
open the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , so the content will be completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes and incre@@ mental .
the dialog will ask you for an * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burn button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burns a previously saved DVD image . the dialog will ask you for an * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be fired immediately by pressing the burn button .
a previously used DVD video can be converted . this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the table view , but can also be used as single @-@ standing . it contains information about the used video , coding settings , and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting of black edges .
displays information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the table view and includes properties of the medium , such as the size and title length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . if an entry is enabled , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is enabled , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not ti@@ cked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view contains an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the table view is enabled , its contents will be displayed in the table view . CD / DVD drives also have a contex@@ tual menu with functions such as Media Info , locks and unlock the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium .
the content view allows selecting and dra@@ gging files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive is selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the head strip is a narrow area , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head strip does not have any real function , it looks only pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the view .
this opens a dialog window to change the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . after you have selected one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key mapping for it below .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrator rights are required , so you need to enter the password for the system administrator at the start of the wizard .
open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general application settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work immediately . this dialog is intended for person@@ alisation and fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . using this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script for example .
in order to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and the type of your task is crucial in the matter which of the accompanying programs you give preference .
in this chapter we assume you can use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must make sure &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following in the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all &amp; k@@ de ; program have in common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other functions for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void format@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void format@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void format@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void format@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void Ravens@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project through using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Forum .
K@@ 3@@ b provides the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Forum listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Forum which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String parent ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( K@@ URL ur@@ l , Q@@ String parent ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String Name ) void re@@ mo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void offset Volum@@ e@@ ID
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then add files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@
&amp; k@@ og@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; reader for &amp; k@@ de ; it can easily be read audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the enco@@ der that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ og@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in wa@@ v files on hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders that coding these WAV files ( These enco@@ der packages still have to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . more enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD are read and stored in wa@@ v files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or in other formats like the loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it must be done now .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ og@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders have to be installed . all these programs are usually available for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it &apos;s probably not necessary to install something yourself . however , if FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ zer gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as I said before , c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to crack any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device fails , it is not possible to use a protected audio CD ; even do not handle the mechanisms of copy protection . simply avoid buying dup@@ lic@@ ated audio CD ; s !
while the setup has to be done only once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , then the daily use to read a &amp; CD will be explained afterwards . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble across at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ ders are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without a network , with everything manually captured .
this is just a short list of commands of the main window . see the step for example for more information on how this program is used , as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of CD data according to the establishment of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
starts reading and - when an enco@@ der is configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup catalog - the encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of En@@ co@@ der available , so that the selection can be read with another enco@@ der than the default . it must be noted that before the enco@@ der has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog .
open the file manager , so that an already utilized file is selected for encoding rather than a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
open the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as minutes , Pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as reading &amp; CD ; ex@@ its ) .
opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audio creator ; with various flash@@ cards ( such as enco@@ der , to set the enco@@ der ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ der and compression ratios and helps you choose the right enco@@ der .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . apart from FLA@@ C , there are also others such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are low compression rates and hardly any commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acousti@@ cal model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may today have an easy advantage over mp3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate the differences are less important as both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless provided with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions
+ high up to very high audio quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG slightly deeper quality in lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG sol@@ vents is present .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto @-@ stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly support only MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , compression rate about 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps CB@@ R . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or fet@@ ched through the program from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . they can be passed / used with &amp; k@@ audio creator ; and the encoding program to create folder and file names as well as the properties of music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the aid to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; add titles to the keywords ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t from l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audio creator must be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database in which people can read the audio CDs that can download information instead of entering the machine . it must be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , Artist , Name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator ) bin not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; any information publicly available on the &amp; CD ; no more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . all information can be obtained anyway during a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audio creator ; is actively selecting a check box ( sending an address ) . for using fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address than the one in the system . in this kind of configuration , it appears , the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This can only know the program@@ mer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if you are using fre@@ ed@@ b , the closest mirror server is to be used ge@@ ographi@@ cally . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the computers .
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online pick @-@ up of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
there are ru@@ mo@@ urs that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution needs to be installed first if this has not yet happened .
to save the read wa@@ v files , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be selected . at first opening , pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) are on the tab for setting the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added to this tab .
the enco@@ der package must be installed by the relevant Linux distribution before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined enco@@ ders .
after installing a enco@@ der , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; Con@@ sole ) .
this can have many reasons . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , writing and reading real , and if both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc . ) are installed .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not work !
there is one chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , you can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keyword ( tags ) .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame must already be installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can , for example , be found using a search engine as it is considered as not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy something into it ) .
the first section treats the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; something that will probably only be done once and
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what should be repeated for each read &amp; CD .
here we determine the enco@@ der to be used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it at any time you read a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the reading program to read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , you can also view the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the map map of General Settings . here you can &apos;t do much . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything will be left as shown as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only select in case of incomplete information , so that you will be informed when information on creating keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and leave the &amp; CD ; data automatically downlo@@ ad@@ able via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection box is easier , becomes a &amp; CD ; entry found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / file names or tag entries , they can be easily changed . the directory or file name is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
you can work with fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you download the database before . however , this is more than 6@@ 20 MB , think twice as to whether this is worthwhile . to fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the fre@@ ed@@ b section .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both function equivalent to the server , since many fire@@ walls are bu@@ cking the protocol 88@@ 80 as standard , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 since the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example we don &apos;t want a &amp; CD ; transfer data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer )
number of simultaneously missing pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , so just try it yourself .
disc@@ ard CD ; after reading the last piece : cross this to the &amp; CD ; disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you do this , then / must be specified the path / folder in which the WAV files are stored . this can be useful if there is only room on another disk . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget to do this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself .
all the same as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a little long , under certain circumstances , something needs to be smoo@@ thed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned before , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the generation of tags on version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of enco@@ ded wa@@ v files at the same time : with a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tempted to en@@ code more than a WAV file at the same time .
this is it , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; this configuration is used as default for each reading a &amp; CD ; use . if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wise , you never need to change it again .
in this section is described how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs on the hard disk . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was created in the previous section . first , a connection to the internet is established , because we are comfortable and want to fetch data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each read &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from that for a &amp; CD ; with successfully fet@@ ched data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually inserted , rather than picking them out of the Internet . comments will point to the differences .
don &apos;t try the &amp; CD ; find this example . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this has not yet been done , now the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen then look in the Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers section for help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the CD has been successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; there is a window appearing , and you can select the database entry that fits your opinion best to your &amp; CD .
if you do not select the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but get the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor - input the CD data and title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini @-@ vidu@@ ally per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words start with upper@@ case letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this restric@@ ts the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment field . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audio creator ; maximum allowed . this option is set on the encoding settings tab .
you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders and file formats . see how to use the enco@@ der to get more information .
just choose an entry that obviously matches with the style of the suff@@ i@@ ding CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; data anyway . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the CD editor window appears again and you can see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed the same way until you have entered all title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear when you download the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be shown above the piece list .
note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the title selected is read out . a simple click on the line switches off the selection of the piece . make sure all pieces are selected , or select the All items at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
if by clicking on the button selection read out the selection process , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on .
click on the tab Or@@ ders to switch to the order window . it is located in the top half of the window , right below the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to check the jobs . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message can be seen if you are trying to work with a enco@@ der that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . did you check if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : job 4 is the encoding of part 1 into the format MP3 . this takes out retri@@ eval and coding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing configur@@ able seems to be the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . in high @-@ performance machines the result is unclear . the used computer with an AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem at simultaneous reading and coding ( of however two different pieces ) .
now the last song is read out while another piece is co@@ ded and a third order is placed in the queue of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is co@@ ded , a small window with a message will appear in the top left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ CD ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice .
if you are familiar with CV@@ S , you can download from there an anonymous copy . most distri@@ butions contain however already a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ og@@ creator ; part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . if you read this , you probably already have done it ...
this section is intended for people who compile source files , and not for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help , how the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs , has many variants of settings . it is best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the various map cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
Hello , still reading ? even if only the Help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any c@@ lue as it should go on from this empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of the program start ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it all about ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ og@@ creator ; but if you want to add or change something useful , let &apos;s do it . at least after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and agrees with this proposal .
strange if you managed to get the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; run SV@@ N , then you do not need these informations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke game by &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , he also has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver , which is required for G@@ US maps . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag and drop so you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically detects the procedure used .
session support . when you finish &amp; k@@ de ; quit playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI synthes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialogue , with which help you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this works also with several songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the button Play in the tool@@ bar , select the item from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts once you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( in several pieces you will be added to a collection and then played afterwards . )
once &amp; k@@ mid , play a play , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and go back and forth with the knob .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows on the left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ Display and so change the speed of playback . to restore the original tempo , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu , then interrup@@ ts playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and other both . some pieces do not have a text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined using a song , so that you do not have to manually set anything manually . so , if you want to change the automatic text selection entry in the Settings menu , the Kara@@ oke text will be automatically selected .
if you want to set an event type , select the entries from the Settings menu . the same function also has the buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summ@@ ari@@ ze . these are played in sequence . in this section you will find how to use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find it in the collection under the item Organ@@ ize ... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then giving the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired item in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs that you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not stored . remember this if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . it appears again the file dialogue , with which help you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on setting automatic adding to the collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece will be automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
when automati@@ cal add to the collection is not checked , when opening a piece , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the continued pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it from the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text .
to skip a song , select the Next Song button , add the next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to reverse a song , select the previous piece button , add previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter , since it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers that are not general MIDI . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General MIDI events translate into events that the synthes@@ izer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of Change patch to B@@ right Piano into events of the Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et type , and thus always makes a trumpet sound if originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all sound cards GM are compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM equipment and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the corresponding file manually ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all the required re@@ plac@@ ements for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , the requirement for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
&quot; &quot; ... &quot; Def@@ ine PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ano@@ ther key@@ map ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D &quot; &quot; &quot;
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as email so I can in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; offer support for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
in this section , you will see how the Pat@@ ches of General MIDI can be m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use is as follows :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All Key@@ s@@ To M is used to set the tone with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun signal ( GM patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with Ton 60 ) , which sounds similar to a rif@@ le .
so if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes Patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that this is the term Tro@@ mmel @-@ Patch of the patch , where every sound represents a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ment instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the sound is the pitch of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) .
the key@@ map section is used to indicate how sounds are displayed on a specific channel or instrument . use is :
as with the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple Key@@ words for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ boards are mainly used to map tones to the perc@@ ussions channel . see , for example , the included keyboard maps .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swap the first and the second channel , simply do it in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI to Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 rows , numbered from 0 to 15 , according to the following sample :
n is the channel which is shown on the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map must be defined further forward in the file . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events that attempt to change the patch on this channel will be ignored . in this case , patch x is always used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For@@ ce@@ patch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option can be useful , for example , to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio P@@ itch bench@@ marks are multip@@ lied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch bench@@ marking event with the value n , this value is converted with the n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then rel@@ a@@ yed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to prevent dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM pre@@ tends that a keyboard which receives a pitch Ben@@ der event with the value of 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , however , some keyboard players try to play two sounds up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI Settings . this can be found in the Settings menu , Point MIDI Settings .
the channel view is a window with a whole number of keyboard sounds ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are just played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played tones . in the Settings menu , select Settings under the Point Channel view : settings
the tempo LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the bigger the speed .
so if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music needs to be played . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you get a similar sound quality .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; compiled without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files separately .
agree to support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
first , activate the setting Automati@@ cally add to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the standard tempo , you can double @-@ click the LCD .
I have a &amp; k@@ de ; desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or stop ( if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) , just change to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the file to the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
if you want to listen to a file only once , without adding them to a collection , switch off automatic addition to the collection , and the new one ; file will be added to the temporary collection . opening files
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mi@@ . and C.@@ Ther@@ mid@@ . First you just want to play the first file . so set the setting Automati@@ cally add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mi@@ de and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , I encourage me to continue programming .

I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . I have programming , MIDI files collect , make music and prove phrases .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kara@@ oke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
if you send me a postcard from your home or a MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . all that send me a postcard or MIDI file , I will list ( if you want to ) . before sending a MIDI file , you should contact me since I might have the file already .
I &apos;ve written &amp; k@@ mid ; written entirely in my spare time and won &apos;t get any money from anyone . I would like to stress that I &apos;m more program@@ mers only because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer as the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same whether you use an FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must have &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you have a sound card except that you can of course not hear music .
if problems occur , please contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; KM@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files that are supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on supported formats , as well as to playback DVD &apos;s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; has not yet been finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that only appears when information is returned .
it is possible to save the preferred links under the Book@@ mark menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category permanent play@@ lists .
of course you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy of hierarchy . when you click on an entry , your group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category , and playback will start with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; up @-@ to @-@ date pieces &apos; , television and permanent play@@ lists can also be changed by direct editing the XML configuration files . of course you can only do that if &amp; KM@@ Player ; not running . the various files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / KM@@ Player / folders directory can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself .
after changing XML files , you have to select play@@ lists from the menu menu and select either the edit mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without matching the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player , some functions can only be enabled by modi@@ fying the XML configuration files ..
the animation of starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to enable a different animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml .
the animation does not need to be short , it is automatically ended by opening another source . this would be annoying at the end animation , so the user can finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; j@@ g ; j@@ g ; &amp; lt ; j@@ g ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / lt ; / sm@@ il@@ eys ; In the source package of &amp; KM@@ Player , are listed in the list of tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L that are supported by &amp; KM@@ Player .
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; here you can set the path to the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for de@@ bu@@ gging is the button &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; in the tool@@ bar of KM@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer visible .
there is no rider for this device in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything needs to be configured by manually editing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c file , just like setting the back@@ end per mim@@ et@@ ype . here &apos;s an example like a flash with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ zilla module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; KM@@ Player ; you can even insert the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
for the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player must be specified as service provider for the Mim@@ e @-@ type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file Con@@ figuration of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or S@@ MB player ; can be started in a console application and searched for error messages regarding loading the browser module library . if there are no errors here , the back@@ end output is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
so that a given back@@ end for a certain mim@@ e type is taken ( of course only if this has been determined ) , it must be done by manually changing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c file . for example , phon@@ on should reproduce all og@@ g files :
&amp; KM@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be viewed , the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured . for this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port should be used . there should be detected ports from which one is selected . the encoding must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b included in it .
since V@@ DR can only use X@@ Video support for KM@@ Player , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux expansion needs to be functional for the X server . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally , various names are used by S@@ MB for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ d source . when enabled , they start playing the playlist .
there are hints how to qui@@ eter my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be run as user root after connecting the device . it is absolutely necessary to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom is on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts only slowly , why does my CPU have to be checked for their performance every time ?
note : the answer is obsol@@ ete . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will test the CPU .

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphic user interfaces and network support , and is needed to compile &amp; box ;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional typ@@ es@@ etting application . under Unix @-@ like systems will probably fall back on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; lin@@ ux distribution . for installation , documentation should be included in the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; Project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; website included .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are considered . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , contact via the box should be made .
the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net should be addressed or desired .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides the ability to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; features in a graphical interface and within this a simple , immediate and bes@@ po@@ ke access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wizard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and powerful project management need to be called .
to learn more about &amp; Po@@ sters ; and to know its possibilities , the manual should be drawn to Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start directly with the reading of chapter Working with the Editor of &amp; Po@@ sters .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right language : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , can also use a La@@ y ( engl@@ . lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; Mak@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while here only a good overview of &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book for this . to be able to control properly , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : Document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
just like other mark@@ up languages includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction with which the general properties such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text letters are specified as well as a KÃ ¶ r@@ per with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } .
the Quick Intro@@ duction Wiz@@ ard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for spe@@ edy creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers some options for creating the document . it can also be done some of the document related settings .
document classes : this includes the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , report &#91; scroll &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Proj@@ ector &#91; Be@@ amer &#93; , Sli@@ des &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
encoding : this is used to set the character encoding . modern systems increasingly use UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as a standard . at best UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ on packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for integration they have to be selected only in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , Let@@ ter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with the German DIN standards ) . you should always find use when preparing German texts .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about this . it is just a brief description of the functions and further information about this are given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - just like other source code editors - high@@ lighting the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ fitting ) . through &amp; ki@@ le , it &apos;s very likely that some mathematical environment is not closed . however , you have noticed it by the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will save you time and money by high@@ lighting .
with automatic completion of the surroundings , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { Command } ) of &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically creates a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the associated line to lock the command ( e.g. \ \ end { Command ) ) . this function can be set in the menu settings box ; La@@ Te@@ X commands are de@@ activated .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub @-@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a single click on the respective document .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; file search can be very helpful . once a DVI ; file &#91; device @-@ independent file &#93; &#93; was created , jumps &amp; ki@@ cks ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Source text .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the edi@@ tary output from &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for view , conversion and printing of DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
the elements of the DVI ; file with the editor are plu@@ cked with the editor and once cli@@ cked on an element in the DVI ; file , the corresponding section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; the source code is the exact opposite . once cli@@ cked on a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; the source code is cli@@ cked to the corresponding place in the DVI ; viewer .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document the work with other involved .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set over project project settings .
quick release : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result will be displayed automatically ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we@@ eding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we@@ eding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there is no appeal of &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick installation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when viewing the Edit tool bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for quick inser@@ tion of common elements into the document . the first drop down box is for quick integration of the document into parts , chapters , sections ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; instructions for sub@@ division are :
the Other is available for entry of items such as tags , notes , notes or references . the available options are :
name : this command creates a name for a section , a picture or a different element .
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( selecting a select field ) .
when using quote , a drop @-@ down list with literary entries is displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last drop @-@ down field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for the definition of the fon@@ ts . the fon@@ ts can be set for the main text , the key notes etc . , the following fon@@ ts are available :
when calling &amp; ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings .
the par@@ enth@@ eses after the command \ \ &apos; class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; speci@@ fies the fon@@ ts . if the font is not specified at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
once the above code example has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the menu of building or the push of a button .
the source code must be saved prior to comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; runs the storage automatically .
failure to compile the document should be searched for errors in logging . if it is used for quick installation &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be followed .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the written letter 12 will be created and only a few columns should have another font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } will then facilitate the change of let@@ tering within the surrounding area .
the changes are only cleared within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the legi@@ bility and user @-@ friendliness of the document . it can be added , for example , certain fon@@ ts , fat pressure , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands either end with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ sive expression and is otherwise closed until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a set can be represented itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . quote begins with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
after the background has been shown to write the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language is now followed by a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; .
once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard , a few adjustments for the better legi@@ bility of the document should be executed . to do this , make a quotation , a few places in the fat and cur@@ ative pressure and a poem to be used to see the differences between these commands .
once the document has been viewed , editor @-@ View or C@@ tr@@ l E can return to the editor again ( for internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , the window must be closed .
once the DVI file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( D e V ice I n@@ º ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps as for the creation of the document are necessary ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed by file print ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file has been created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion can begin with the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the pre @-@ selection search allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position inside the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Bin@@ ding files . to do this , only Modern can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... Tools Buil@@ dings will be selected .
in order to check the pre @-@ selection procedure , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source code and then cli@@ cked on pre @-@ search . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer is then eff@@ ected .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Document by &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and jump to the appropriate line . to do this , &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; defined as a text editor ( settings ey@@ epi@@ ece setup ... Editor )
if an error occurs while using the &amp; DVI file , there may be an error . if there is an error , this will be shown in the log file or in the message window .
the log file explains the source of error in the source code . in the editor you can use the Pre@@ vious La@@ Te@@ X errors and other La@@ Te@@ X errors for spr@@ ints between the bugs . the log file always indicates the line in which the error appears . in order to view the faulty line , the error in the logging must be cli@@ cked and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the wrong line .
when you click on the relevant button in the tool@@ bar , a window to select the template to be used will appear for the document . the default options are :
when selecting an empty document , a document can either be re@@ written or used for quick creation of a new document . further information can be found in the section .
frequent users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for nearly all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file will be open or created a new file . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by using an existing document and choose File template from document ... Cre@@ ate .
when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in settings box ... preferences are set .
when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings are to be replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ C@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by typing in document class . typically , it will be used as follows : \ \ Movie class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ C@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; .
the simplest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created this way , the following steps have to be executed :
when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the standard .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files created . if a simple way to create a template is desired , you should search for one on the Internet and follow the steps described below .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; Po@@ sters ; as internal editor . &amp; Po@@ sters ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and prot@@ ru@@ ding of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
to learn more about &amp; Po@@ sters ; and its possibilities , the manual should be consul@@ ted with Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can begin directly with reading the chapter Working with the Editor of &amp; Po@@ sters .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be called via the La@@ Te@@ X reference manual . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands in &amp; lat@@ ex ; you can find use as well as its syntax .
double @-@ clicking with pressed C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that by clicking \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
when dra@@ gging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text will automatically be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse the various types of source texts and highlight these . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are distinguished by a different color .
many assistants can add additional jump marks . this is an own kind of book@@ marks within the text . the men@@ Ã ¼ ls edit jump @-@ brands or the appropriate ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes result in the jump to the next or last jump mark .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; even though &amp; Po@@ sters ; already outstanding features have been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; also supports many environments and groups and therefore supports &amp; ki@@ cks ; special commands for their selection .
he@@ als a complete paragraph ( group of lines that contain an empty line on both sides ) . this expanded meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only way to change is that the ab@@ s@@ ements are separated by two empty lines .
he@@ als the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , as this command also includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a crack spread ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , natural this first can be selected and removed by pressing the Del key . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides the key C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers with own commands for faster possibility .
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is contained in the description to Edit Sel@@ ection paragraph .
it has already been made clear that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for more orders under the Edit area for a possible easy work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command is inj@@ ected at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to lock the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is located before or inside the command \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the overview can be lost quickly . this command will include the last modified environment , so that the ne@@ sted ambient structure will not be destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups specified by par@@ enth@@ esis { ... } . in the Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that match those from the Edit area .
this command is inj@@ ected at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the braces opening .
this command is inj@@ ected at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the welded clasp .
if the cur@@ sor is in front or behind the shiel@@ ded bracket of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted groups braces can be lost quickly . this command completes the last opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple application notes are used as a guide . for the purpose @-@ producing implementation is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; is used for two simple applications .
this automatic inser@@ tion of the double g@@ entry character can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
it can also be used for specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) , so that German or French suits are used . many other languages are also available .
when setting Shift ; input key for &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not just a line break , but at the same time the command \ \ item .
the current line with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be set in settings box ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables surroundings and thereby all E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) among each other . when pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the next tab in the underlying line . although this tab is usually not the associated line , add &amp; Ki@@ le ; some gaps for the columns position of the current tab .
although &amp; Po@@ sters ; already offering a good source code completion , it has been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; for special orders ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , three different modes are installed . all these modes can be set up for different ways of working under Settings ...
at the beginning a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } becomes &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the click button , the last letter of the input is removed and it is possible to gr@@ ind the complete list . on the other hand , the list can be reduced by entering a further letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed from the selection of a command . alternatively , jump marks can also be frozen , so that a jump to these positions is possible by modi@@ fying the jump mark N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ est jump mark and the desired parameters can then be frozen .
under Settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; complete settings for these lists . it can be used to select different list lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands , as well as W@@ app@@ ings of common language use .
command mode is not useful for the completion of environments . there must always be a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the call of the complete mode will result in a great list of environment commands . on the other hand , environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for the completion of environments .
when calling the full @-@ size environment or the key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment automatically is frozen and it appears \ \ begin . thereafter , the ambient accident can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key .
once this has been done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; Ki@@ le , recognize that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item -@@ command will be frozen .
under Settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; complete settings for these lists . this mode uses the complete list of full @-@ space &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supports user @-@ defined lists of ab@@ uses that are immediately replaced by a lower string . the lists can be set up under Settings box ... Ki@@ le can be set up . for example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word execution mode is initiated over the menu , or the key C@@ tr@@ l + Alt vac@@ ancy , the character L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
big towels are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been noted that many people in a document are written more than once . this provides &amp; Ki@@ le ; the full excuse for all written books already written .
this mode can be set up in the menu settings box ... ki@@ cks can be completely switched off . here , the threshold value for displaying the full extent can be specified .
the exec@@ utable files can be installed in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ki@@ le / complete / chest / complete / mode / of the personal home folder . mode is available for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Graphics dialog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; creates graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of graphics formats , the sections should be ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PS files are not as popular as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and re @-@ orders of pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
to evaluate the results of the work , you need to compile the source code . all construction tools are grouped in groups in the menu creation comp@@ iling , creating converting and creating view .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewers like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or another conversion can be used the key Alt ; 2 . after that , the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file in the standard viewer by Alt ; 4 , with Alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed .
when using the Quick Start command , a viewer is normally called after comp@@ iling . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window will open every time .
a new project is being asked about the project New Project .... In this context , the following information is asked for the project :
when selecting the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows you to run EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be administr@@ ated over scripts in vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can still be used in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = Ki@@ le ) with the following methods has :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a rather sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different aids to support the users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; Tex@@ live ; supplied with many documents , including a documentation for the packages contained and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all to &amp; Ki@@ le ; supplied documents and a graphical surface area .

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . with the command @-@ line interface , you create random signatures or day signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides the signatures for external e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read out . by many signatures with different quotes , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for daily signatures , the same signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read for the whole day . for each day use it with different signatures , as with the random signatures you create unique e @-@ mails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N file New . this gives you a lt ; empty signatures ; in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section . click on the &amp; lt ; empty signatures ; and add your new signature in the bottom section . signature @-@ Ex@@ ample Kon@@ qi kon@@ qi @ k@@ de@@ .org ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org If you typ@@ ed your signature , save it with C@@ tr@@ l ; S file Save or click the disk icon Save .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then in the File &gt; Rem@@ ove or click on the icon with the red cross in the tool@@ bar .
here you can select short commands for menu entries . to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the Custom Button and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the button or key combination .

everyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation , knows me and how outstanding it is . do we raise it one piece , we give him a graphical interface ! no more on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked on the icon for the XML processor and done !
this application is expected to be inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in a common folder , then leave the current folder . if not , then remove the selection of current folder and enter the folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files will be deleted every time mein@@ pro@@ c is started .
as I said before , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for that .
if the newly opened file is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book then simply select the current job folder . if not , then select current folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book can be found .
if it comes to an output on the screen , its file is defective . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then let the current file simply be checked . if not , delete the file at the current file and select the file to be reviewed by other file - file selection .
if you only want to know if the well @-@ formed file is , click the well @-@ formed check selection .
for using a &amp; DT@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and enter the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; with Defin@@ itions UR@@ I ; file selection .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed is in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , already selected , then let the current file simply be selected . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed by the other file file selection .
specify the name of the file as the result is to be named . the file is usually stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone uses the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
to install a plug @-@ in or a c@@ Part , we start editing the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows to manage all contained plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plu@@ gins without a location , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often working on a project involves several individuals in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the indication of team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties -@@ dialog .
the name and email are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as Team Leader and Sub@@ project Manager .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by searching the team member out of the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identi@@ fier ) appears in bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of your own identity are important in regards to news and comments . see for more information on notes .
in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team leaders when something is happening . see for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something is happening in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project so that later it can be seen how much someone was working on or sending a message when a file is saved , or a script that plays a file to the CV@@ S once it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the Event Con@@ figuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the address data selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project manager .
remarks are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
notes to enter is simple . it can either be selected from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword is entered in a comment field followed by ann@@ ot@@ ation text .
notes can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the team member , role play a role in the project from the following possibilities :
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case letters , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found in .
the settings can be set up by settings Qu@@ anta ... called . this dialog extends over a few pages that are treated one after another .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including code completion can be changed with it . entries are :
tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal / lo@@ wer@@ case means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal / lo@@ wer@@ case means the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically close : if checked , for tags , for which the closing tag is optional , it will be inserted immediately after the tag .
non @-@ optional tags automatically include : as above for all other tags except for simple tags .
start and finish date automatically update : if enabled , the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of accentu@@ ated characters into the corresponding coding during typing .
M@@ IME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . using the default button , the default values can be restored .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening open files ( where the encoding of the file can be b@@ yp@@ assed ) . however , this setting is executed by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the chosen DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been detected . however , this setting is displayed by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regular backup copies so that during a power failure or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in your own view ( or documentation in a tab@@ loid ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
set the window settings to the default back at the next start is useful when the user interface has come through changing the M@@ DI modes and other / depending on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command line parameters .
the warning messages area is used to control the display of warnings by hook of no more .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ izing behavior of the PL@@ A and the source text view in shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the figure of the par@@ ser node in the document , can be set in detail .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the area of structural tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ness of the tree during processing and how deep in a change of the structure tree should be opened automatically . empty knots are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those where no element was found in the current document .
the area for setting abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) , which will un@@ fold when editing to more extensive text . abbrevi@@ ations are in groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the if@@ ant abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from third page , which can be re @-@ used by any c@@ Part @-@ capable application , the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin , if it is not located in a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information is given to the plug @-@ in when starting , so it can open the current file , folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
load the component in the &quot; Read Only &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts normally deny the loading if this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , if the information entered is correct , even if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely new developed . support for the no more necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger has been set , as well as support for the DB@@ G Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implement@@ ations to plug @-@ ins .
currently only one plugin is available that adds support for the use of &amp; gu@@ l ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the use of the Deb@@ ug@@ ger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the Project Properties . with the button Settings next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug @-@ in drop @-@ down sel@@ ector , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view where the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all locking points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger if required , or it tells the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bug requirements . this action is triggered by default , when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally it does not have to be paid attention to .
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ ging session starts the session . includes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger output view .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start running the script and send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens , while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if the script is started , the script starts with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start execution of the script without inform@@ ing information about controlled variables and the current line number . if this happens , while a script is stopped , the execution continues . if it happens before a de@@ bug is given , the execution starts as soon as a request is set .
the de@@ bu@@ gger introduces the next command in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger introduces the next instruction in the script , where possible , if possible , in functions and include incor@@ rectly .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the instruction and go to the next , as if there were not the current one .
open a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered that is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work by Keith Is@@ dale and this part of documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g , that they can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many other works of Keith .
this chapter describes how you can adjust &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; adapt to your needs and like you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; help you become better .
document type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ets ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; capabilities like code completion and node trees . their simplicity and flexibility make of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS ; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag files contain two file types , the Tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag files are handy , symbolic columns of image buttons ( above the editing pane ) , which insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see in for details on conversion .
this document describes how to create tag XML files , then file descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
tag@@ XML Files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the Fe@@ atur@@ es@@ di@@ alog@@ es , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow for quick inser@@ ting tags into a document without the risk of a writer .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the file descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the tag XML files . tag files carry the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declare whether they are necessary or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information in working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . all about the possibilities and limitations are explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a tag XML document . it can only appear once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing else but only element type over itself .
the type of tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only Family 2 )
only valid for class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only Family 2 )
only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only Family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attribute group and attributes within that tag can be added to any other day . ( only Family 1 )
sets a text into the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it defines the name and type of the attribute . in addition , there are other tags describing how to display this attribute &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element .
speci@@ fies the source code for the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag that assem@@ bles the elements of a list . it can only appear once for an attribute description . it is a single element element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
this tag should be available for each field in the dialog once ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined . this element is a single element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a tag . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . they should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause sh@@ red@@ ding , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tool is dialog at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to select . another dialog will appear whose simple instructions will follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , the check is only in loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
in the following , an example for a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this tag XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following , an example for a working family 2 day XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; Over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! Doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optionally &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , achiev@@ able via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . this can be edited by di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = turn 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name will be used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... created . click New action to create the same dialog :
the keyboard short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking the user button , a key short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ eine the current ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes can be removed .
the simplest actions . it can be inserted a text in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document in the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action you can start external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) , started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the Quick Start dialog or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . This way , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus tries to locate the script in the following places : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in its path : $ PA@@ TH There is other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we replace with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name is removed .
% p@@ id : is replaced with PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; process replaced . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , only one instance is running , the text is unique to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can input &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in the selection field you can specify what is to be sent to the default input . options are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , directed to the standard output . it can be specified what should be done with the text written on the standard output , by setting the value in the output selection box :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create an own tool@@ bar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the Mark@@ up .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Pre@@ ferences actions .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
complete all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
complete everything and , if the day has attributes and you plan their use , enable dialog &quot; Edit Tag &quot; if available , so that an input when using the action is possible .
who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulties .
to create a symbol , that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics , other programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the tag start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually interpreted as loose , fixed , further interpreted ) , or should at least sign@@ alize a message to the user that clicking this symbol will include a &amp; lt ; start the day in the current document .
after creating the symbol , it must still be connected to the action . this is done via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , if there are any , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; add functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview . open the tool@@ bar set dialog on settings tool@@ bars . make sure the desired tool bar is selected .
after selecting the element that is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar .
please note how dis@@ connect the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar might believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by tasting all symbols to make sure everything works .
after new e@@ XML does not exist , it is created in root folders , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust your file descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that its tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) when a file is opened by the appropriate type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation to the script language or the format@@ ting language you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to search for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc . then you must create the doc@@ r@@ c file .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation html files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index of Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 &#91; ... &#91; Con@@ text &#93;
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation such as :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = Basic syntax , ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except by reason ) m@@ das@@ h ; but try it yourself .
you realize that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; file is displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Resour@@ c@@ end@@ ings will be replaced .
the content section is the area of the doc@@ r@@ c file , which is used to create context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; scripts to display the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . by marking the function name and pressing C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context help the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your doc@@ r@@ c file and go to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / Wonder@@ share / doc for local and global use . then create a folder ( as you have specified in your doc@@ r@@ c file ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation to it .
if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation were used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the failing resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or anyone else . in different places there is an e @-@ mail menu entry , such as the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive from where all others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users they can download . the contributions will be checked and made available only if our team uses them as correct and us@@ eful@@ l for publication . to make an updated contribution , the source of resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the event you have multiple keys , you can choose one . in the dialog New resource enter the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and start up@@ loading with OK the upload .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload tool bar tool@@ bar , and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled .
it is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , the creation may be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be required in everyday XML format . there is the easier way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D File and Conver@@ ting a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description which is to be used . then the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type definition line : the string that appears in the ! Doc@@ type Tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand them and to be able to draw full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first introduce themselves to these fundamental concepts .
in &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three sections : global , local and project related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available for each , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; use , available . from tool bars over actions , everything that is marked global is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the administrators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only be used in person .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most limited size . all elements are em@@ itted in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ it the joint use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of a number of main areas : the editor window , the construction views , the flash@@ cards with information and the tool@@ bars .
you can use the right mouse button to select a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other , or all of the tab@@ s , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a bookmark or run of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the editor area leads to another contex@@ tual menu with regard to the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cutting / past@@ ing / past@@ ing ) , editing the tags located under the mouse cur@@ sor , or opening the file , if the string is called a file under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor .
at the top end of the editor window , the tool@@ bars of the editor are located . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is displayed . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert into your document , then click on the symbol that represents the tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in different fields in a dialog .
the Bau@@ man@@ tas ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable you to navigate to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open them and ro@@ am . in the presentation with file gri@@ ds stand for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view displays all files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as add , remove , upload or delete the files from the storage media can be performed with the displayed contex@@ tual menu .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . global templates are always available , local templates only available for the appropriate users and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information to a script . by right @-@ clicking , you can access the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is set in the document to the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element , a list of commands opens in relation to the navigation and refres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears under the other tree views . it can easily change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces with it . the application @-@ oriented entry system allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation of the web technique for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be app@@ ended , edited and viewed project @-@ specific documentation .
by default &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two tab@@ s at the bottom of the window where useful information can be reached : the message window and the problem window .
this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the Mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
die &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive expanded and easy to understand . show them to a symbol and they will display the appropriate command . the tool bar of the tool@@ bars is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you get a tool bar in an email , you can save it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other store and load !
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . for that , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that is not an older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the PA@@ TH ahead of its bin folder . the same is true for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML editor , developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ? well , this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now widely on the way to a generic and comprehensive web development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML , then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus should be the appropriate &amp; IDE .
now , to the above claim , it must be noted that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of Why develop what already someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only possible , but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity dramatically . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task possible .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly developed to a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more details in the details refer to help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or execute help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not located , the oldest record is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . check the section on Tem@@ plates . should they attempt to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
when inser@@ ting from cli@@ p@@ board there special characters are converted to &amp; HTML , so they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions .
converts text from cli@@ p@@ board to &amp; URL ; sp@@ elling which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily used for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s into the anchor tag .
this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; button .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ Script er@@ r error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined phrases to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
extension and switching of the problem re@@ porter at the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set Book@@ marks with a click of the mouse .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries previous or next , depending on the cur@@ sors position in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped by the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
open an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows you to copy video files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
load the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you will find the details explained .
load a project tool@@ bar . these are kept in project you / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
open a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be set by means of settings ... to be added . tool@@ bars are stored by tool@@ bar tool@@ bars or you are asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . you don &apos;t delete it from your hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do so .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team , so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as attachment .
allows up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
load one &amp; DT@@ D ; that you or anyone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
rel@@ o@@ ad / refresh entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refres@@ hed without rene@@ wing all &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the store fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu item in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags Tag , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the inser@@ ting by tool bar is denied if this day contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the plu@@ gins menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed below the above menu items . click on them . click on an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activ@@ ates it .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ ata depends on the posters ; -@@ version .
choose the type of line identi@@ fier . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the current document &apos;s syntax based on the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes take time or create un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub @-@ window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window .
displays the status bar display at the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
the changes in this dialog affect any application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
direc@@ ts the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; Po@@ sters , you will find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the tool@@ bar , or which you can add and change the sequences .
this should create a help in accordance with the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter &apos;s environment , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , development in financial form , they find the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should ideally be filled from top to bottom , as e.g. after filling the project name the entire directory structure will be automatically completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can later be set with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties .
here &apos;s the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled in automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can specify the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ ad@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used . depending on the remote host &apos;s setting , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and default templates . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder in which the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows you to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . you can select multiple files or whole folders .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . in case of server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started from scratch , not hooks .
with this option , all files and folders will be displayed inside the main folder and you can select an exact choice of man@@ ure .
this displays a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the tick , clips from the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the sub@@ window profile or with the key short@@ cut Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the Project Assistant and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( wild@@ cards possible ) , which are re @-@ read in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
added option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this allows the desired de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the button Settings . in the troubleshooting section is described .
in the Pro@@ files section , high @-@ profile sections ( see in ) can be set up , as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by applying its own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration , event actions can be switched on and these actions can be added , modified or deleted . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ determined event occurs , such as securing a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus opens ; the last project that was opened .
to open another project , select project open ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ sli@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project manager gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folder beha@@ ves as well , but the entries open and open with ... with the right mouse button on the right @-@ click context menu :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows to remove the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button will be bl@@ ended to prevent the removal .
the password will be kept in memory and forgotten during programs . this option is useful if frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather uns@@ afe password on the disk storage option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high load profiles can be created to upload the project ( or parts of the project ) to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog will be displayed :
this is the server &apos;s name on which the files should be copied . either a full @-@ qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should select from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it cannot be read easily , but anyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. , through simple exchange of view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted in the Project or Project tool@@ bar , accessible via the tool bar project tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to its own working method .
as already mentioned above , tool bars are in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best handled by the tool@@ bar menu . use and add differs . the addition of tool bars is handled at the bottom of the addition of tool@@ bars .
the tool@@ bar and the symbols on it can be set either using context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which with new action , a new tool@@ bar can be created , other actions such as tool@@ bars can be removed , tool@@ bars should be ren@@ ame , or tool bars should be executed , which can be specified in the dialog where the actions on this or other tool@@ bars should be displayed .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , additionally the entries action will be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu ... and set up actions .
templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ ps , and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any existing directory in the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the limitations one imag@@ ines for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template prior to use .
binary templates are usually inserted in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are found in the template tree under global templates . more information on the template tree is available .
documents can be created by any text document type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . typically , more specific documents can be created in appropriate sub@@ folders . you make a simple sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding for the purpose and organize the work in a proper way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
this type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment to a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl .
as the name says , these templates are used for entire sites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summ@@ arized in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
design a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and choose File As template save as local template ....
once this has been done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look in the template tree below project templates .
select text in your document and click File As template save choice as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily dra@@ gged with dra@@ gging and dra@@ gging onto the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : copy the file only to a template folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as drag and drop or paste over the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree .
in the file tree or in the project file , you can click a folder on the right and create site template , enter a name for the template and back up . by default , it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can set head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or dynamically create with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates . each folder corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder , click the right mouse button to click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is blin@@ ded as soon as el@@ ter@@ ous attributes are inherited .
this is enabled by default and fits everything except the root folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set , it would basically disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text brick . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows pre@@ defined or copied text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows to fill a whole presentation with the appropriate head@@ lines / foot@@ ers by copying contents templates to a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( show right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor , which can be accessed through the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and turn back to source editor when needed , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document containing &amp; PHP ; contains a small green symbol displaying the V@@ oh@@ and@@ ze of &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit it , the source text editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first one , except that at the same time the changes in the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor are visible and the cur@@ sor is active in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; with pressing F@@ 9 , this mode is already active , the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke activ@@ ates the active cur@@ sor from one window to the other , maintaining the position in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta . after choosing V@@ PL ; you can choose between synchron@@ ization by one click or automatically . in general , the recommendation is : a small range for fast computers and a large margin for slow computers .
assuming you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to select document properties . this allows the editing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; editor . the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created .
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information on the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons down . one click in the list allows changing the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of designing pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the appropriate file .
cur@@ sors are used as in a word processor , by moving with arrows . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves strange . the marker functions as usual . text can be inserted by typing and deleted by means of a button or a ran@@ ge@@ button .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way via the tool@@ bars , as in the source text editor . it must be noted that the inser@@ tion of tags is not removed before already existing identical tags , e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , must be removed any other surrounding anchor tag .
some tool@@ bars like the table assistant or the Li@@ sts Wiz@@ ard are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the study of style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for specific elements is possible and the performance of the style template can be tra@@ cked .
to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , you need besides &amp; k@@ de ; the lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML libraries , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ;
new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db Comp@@ ati@@ bility Mode , wai@@ ste retention points can be set in a given file and line number and later activated .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g comp@@ utes the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without a path . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the top loaded style template file names with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g If for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is loaded , the following input is possible :
in this command , a partial or entire agreement is checked with a pre@@ age called my@@ ME or a specified model name . &amp; eg ; template agrees with every my@@ ME that contains the template &apos;s template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended by the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 is &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a sought @-@ after retaining point must be resolved for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this will be executed automatically when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . holding points will be re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each pass .

adds the parameter with the name &amp; lt ; NA@@ ME ; and the value &amp; lt ; V@@ AL@@ U@@ E@@ gt ; add to the X@@ SL environment variables . see also the add@@ par@@ am command
if --@@ repeat is specified twice as specified , the conversion will be executed 100 times
the input documents are treated as HTML files if the support for this has been enabled in Lib@@ XML
enables the X@@ Inclu@@ de processing of the input document when the support for it has been enabled in Lib@@ XML . this is turned on as default .
on systems with installed Re@@ ad@@ line library , you can use the arrow keys on / off through the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory of the previously executed commands .
several commands require more than one argument . quotation marks can be used to pass composite expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as argument you set a stop in a file called &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template consisting only of the ASCII character 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a completely qualified name like &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
fil@@ en@@ ame : a valid local file name on the user &apos;s system . on Unix or Cy@@ g@@ win systems , the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder . other environment variables are allowed on R@@ IS@@ C @-@ OS systems .
PA@@ TH : a path to change the folder . on some operating systems , the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; is replaced by the path to your personal folder .

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time adjusted the ind@@ entation to many places . another program@@ mer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts when merging .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there were no references to the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a little night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , any amount of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare notes , just copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison windows .
a function that did a lot of work was the compar@@ ability and merging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful when two people work independently of each other in a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; for folder merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and follows the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently need to check code , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed . if rows differ only in a certain number of white characters , you can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if someone changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is equal , and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can make typing by typing just the file name of the first file . example :
K@@ diff@@ 3 folder @-@ 1 folder @-@ 2 folder @-@ 1 folder @-@ 2 -@@ o target folder k@@ diff@@ 3 folder @-@ 1 folder @-@ 2 folder @-@ 2 folder @-@ 3 -@@ o target folder
opening Di@@ alogue enables manual typing of fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C blank , the analysis of differences with two files will be performed .
click on the folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , however , if a file is selected , for B and C a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders .
if merging is enabled , the input field is active and can be processed . however , it is not necessary to immediately specify an output file . you can also do this step later when saving .
the Con@@ figuration button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before starting comparing / merging .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board to the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in the opening dialog , you do not have to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
which idea is behind it ? sometimes , a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively big effort . you just need to create two corresponding files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , and then compare them . now you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently you cannot extract anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a comparison window will be supported .
warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and dra@@ gging of text into another program as cutting and past@@ ing ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Every info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse over the line for a while . then a small help@@ desk will show the full name . )
the three spring windows are the letters A , B and C assigned . a has the color blue , B the color Green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , you can see which file is different . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . this is good to see in the next section ( merging ) .
in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in rare rare cases . )
the vertical line dividing the merge column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines . if the line breaks are enabled , the line is represented on broken lines .
the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the wor@@ ding issue : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; ... &#93; if you edited the result . usually it contains already text by automatic merging , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the S@@ prin@@ ge button to the next dissolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find still remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is at the same time a conflict that must be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the line will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . ( this will also make a jump in the position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black beam .
sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging or by manually editing ; then in these lines the text &amp; lt ; No row in the queue ; appears . this is only a plac@@ eholder for the event that you change your mind and maybe select another source . this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a marker you may copy and paste elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : when selecting the sources options ignor@@ ing numbers or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side up , side down , beginning , end , C@@ tr@@ l start and C@@ tr@@ l end , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs .
in the display window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the In@@ sert key , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summ@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as already explained in the merge and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Down / Str@@ g @-@ Up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Down / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Image Ab@@ road ) or to the next / previous un@@ solved conflict .
to copy the marking to the cli@@ p@@ board , you must copy the Copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l @-@ paste ) . it is also possible to copy the option selection automatically . if this is enabled , whatever you tick is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and the manual copy is om@@ itted . be careful with this option as you could accidentally over@@ write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
line ends are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line \ \ r \ r \ r \ r \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not retain the line end of the source files , so you should not use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , nor with bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of recently used files will be automatically saved in the end and restored at the next start . ( menu Sett@@ ing@@ s- &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fon@@ ts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences in itali@@ c text will be displayed . if the chosen font does not support this display , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered sc@@ anned . on these systems , the pres@@ et button automatically sets an un@@ defined color .
if this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab character will be inserted .
when you press En@@ ter or Return , the input of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
when this option is checked , each selection will automatically be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual copy to the cli@@ p@@ board is not necessary .
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white characters are ignored . even when merging white characters are ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , but then files with different sizes may look identical in the page @-@ to @-@ side comparison , although they are different . during the merge , this option must be de@@ activated . in default , this is de@@ activated .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
inten@@ sely search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow in very large files .
in Automatic skip mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is passed .
solve all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you only need this from time to time , then use better the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are activated .
these options are dealt with in the chapter on the scanning of folders and conducting a merge . look for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge tracking .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if a backup file already exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adapting this option does not affect the current running program . you must &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart to make the change active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally via the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set for each entry separately . if enabled , the top setting is used for all entries .
above the selection fields for encoding , a brief note appears , which is the local code . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually configur@@ able , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which code to be used for saving .
if you define pre@@ processor commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre@@ processor can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre@@ processor commands .
turn this down to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting of changes in white characters in text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are activated . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color co@@ ded over@@ see column . but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files . depending on the selection of A &amp; lt ; s ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ; C will appear next to the normal , a second over@@ f@@ eit column with the information you need .
sometimes you would rather like to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply stop the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
assign the comparison window side by side or above each other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you view the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click starts the merge and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it will first hand over to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that exactly meets your needs . you can use this function for example to cut out disturbing parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command has been specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre@@ processor command . you can write your own pre@@ processor that meets your needs . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is that the user needs more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program this themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command for line trun@@ ks to convert the input into upper@@ case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / \ \ \ 1 / \ \ \ 1 / \ \ \ 1 / \ \ \ 1 / \ \ \ 1 / \ \ 1 / \ \ 1 / \ \ 1 / \ \ 1 / \ \ 1 / \ \ 1 .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word substitution ) . all following the same pattern $ keyword is required .
while you experiment with sed , you may start to understand it and perhaps you may even like those regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre@@ processor for line equivalent . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and any hit is replaced by nothing , thus quasi deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from one another . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; Aller@@ dings are different in per@@ l some details . where used \ \ ( and \ \ ) , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data according to the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for displaying and merging . other operations only change the data that the line reconciliation algorithm sees .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any feature that changes text or hides differences , you may not accidentally notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often , program@@ mers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge complete folders with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the suggestion before starting ,
... can simul@@ ate the merging and display the simulated changes without actually performing them ,
... takes selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and merging single files . you just have to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder was specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not merging . to start merging , you must select the corresponding menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow . )
while reading the folder , you will be informed of a small message window about the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folders , only the files that have been compared until then are listed .
if the scanning of the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and folder that was found during the scan is displayed in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually displayed together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - or double @-@ clicking on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right . the menu menu provides two functions to fold all sub@@ directories with which you can open all folders .
when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be selected automatically .
as shown in the picture above , the A / B / C columns are used in red , green , yellow and black .
in identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries is different .
folders are considered identical when their entire content is identical . then , folders also have the same color . in folders , the age is in@@ significant for its color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ ti@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , merging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , merging cannot be started .
the mode for syn@@ cing is active , if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified and if the option directories are active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; copied directly after merging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge ( uns@@ afe ) , then investigate &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and then suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the same date appears , then an error message appears : files are not removed , the merging of the folders cannot be started .
while merging one file after the other , it displays a file after the merge operation has been successful , and according to other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is completed , you should make a final check and check if the status is all right .
if Full analysis is selected in the setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display other columns . these include the number of un@@ resolved , deleted , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging .
please note : if you don &apos;t have a destination folder , then in the three @-@ folder merging mode , C will be used as the target . in the two @-@ folder merging , B is chosen as destination and used for syn@@ cing A and / or B as destination .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries should be in the destination folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options that might be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge start / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key short@@ cut ) . to just add the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merge actions , a message appears on the incorrect elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all the entries , a dialog box appears with the options Con@@ duct , Sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el .
please choose Sim@@ ulate if you first want to see what would happen without actually making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , a merge window will open ( note the screen shot ) .
if you are finished with a file , select / continue directory merge again or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog will appear . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue its work with the next entry .
when you continue merging ( F@@ 7 key ) , you will see some error messages that will help you decide the cause of the problem . if you continue merging ( F@@ 7 key ) , you can choose to try another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before you continue merging .
if some entries have been merged , you will see &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries will not be merged again later . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not stored , these entries are considered to be done . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Edit menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files matching the specified pattern will be displayed in the element tree . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignor@@ es files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this can be set folder @-@ specific with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a default attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a previous point marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
when the option is off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in default .
if the option is turned off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the links will be treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; does not check for possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder containing a link on itself would result in a loop loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is switched off in default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of dissolved , un@@ solved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders using a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed benefit will cost you a certain degree of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
similar to the date of change . there is no real comparison . the files are considered i@@ den@@ tically , if they are equal . this can be useful , for example , when copying the change date . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
activ@@ ates the syn@@ cing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merging are chosen so that both folders are identical . the results of merging files are also stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default .
if there are differences , instead of merging the newer file , it will be proposed as action . ( this is considered uns@@ afe because it is assumed that the other file has not been changed . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced by another or deleted , then the original version is renamed and gets the extension .@@ orig@@ .@@ If an old backup file already exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , then it will be deleted without further backup . this also concerns the normal merging of individual files , not just the merge of whole folders . this option is enabled in default .
normally the folder merge view is visible when merging single files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can switch the window divi@@ der in the window menu and switch between the two views using the directory &amp; text window .
you probably prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . however , you can merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge . to do so , you can run a single file directly from the merge menu .
however , this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : re @-@ reading
K@@ DE supports network transparency using K@@ IO slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders .
a path can be relative . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file will always be accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or change date differ from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently available as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P will first always start the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; indicate that the input file is a patch file in unified format . then remove &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to recover the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the Con@@ text menu . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; being executed as part , it only supports the comparing of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ user ( now available ) are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ user has already indicated that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I already use GP@@ L programs for a long time and have learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all program@@ mers who have gone this way or let him go .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default , configure is installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this subject .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only one non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as non @-@ identical .
the editor notices each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this is necessary to easily resolve a conflict by clicking in the source text and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information .
you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is fl@@ ushed out ; No sr@@ c left ; and the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
you can find a list of recent changes under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir indicates the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto @-@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . if you still encounter difficulties , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of this .
cut off ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift Del@@ ete ) Copy to cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift @-@ In@@ sert ) add the text from cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position or replace the current marking .
only show differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read the folder with the update after changes to these options . )
there are only entries showing differences . this also causes identical files to merge into the destination folder . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the let@@ tering A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed by clicking the button .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . under@@ statement in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays a thumb@@ nail of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite handy to see the running programs on the work@@ tops , change their size , end them or shift them . this works both within a desktop as well as several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual working spaces as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and moved even on the desktop and on others .
with the middle mouse button , window inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved . movement is possible both within a desktop and other working areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu only has to set up the two entries P@@ ager ... and end . if , however , on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize , maximize , on desktop and end .
maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows inside the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ spaces .
if this field is crossed , the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager will display the names of the virtual work@@ spaces .
tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual work@@ spaces . if it is crossed with name , the names will be given with ord@@ inal numbers , eg ; 1 . desktop .
if this field is enabled , the background of each desktop is displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
if this field is enabled , the current programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only empty work@@ spaces will be displayed to allow their selection .
here is the view of the program window . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N ra@@ ster , as from P@@ ager applications in some other window managers , horizont@@ ally shows all virtual work@@ tops in a horizontal row , which is very good for displaying later@@ ally on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display and move windows as symbols or with their content . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , and set up switch @-@ up sel@@ ector ... lets the dialog appear .
at the moment this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or turn to your system administrator .

&amp; K@@ mag ; is a screen saver . you can use &amp; K@@ mag to increase a part of the screen , as if you read a magni@@ fying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is intended for various users : including artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag .
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended with new features . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers .
when you &amp; K@@ mag ; start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; displays the magni@@ fied area of the screen . in the following , this window is called magni@@ fication window . the image shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
in default , magni@@ fied &amp; cli@@ cked ; the area around the mouse cur@@ sor as a moving lou@@ pe . alternatively you can &amp; K@@ mag ; for this cause a selected screen area in the magni@@ fication window ( selection window mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse cur@@ sor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cur@@ sor setting . please note , that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not able to detect the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default node ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor into the magni@@ fication window and hold the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fication window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you press additionally the &amp; Shift ; press button or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the selection window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the drop @-@ down window is fixed and only the lower right corner is moved .
&amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
starts or stops updating the display . stopping the updating causes the needed CPU time to go against zero .
select the update rate ( Very low , Low , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window appears . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to save files , open a new window , print , new@@ bies ( with the button document re@@ charge in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlarge and size &amp; etc .
K@@ mag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen magni@@ fier ; use an area of screen to enlarge as if you would use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for various people : from research or artist to web designer or visual impair@@ ment .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mou@@ sec@@ lick as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor wa@@ its for a while at the same place . it is intended to help people who suffer from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome ( repeti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syndrome ) and cause pain to any mou@@ sec@@ lick .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor wa@@ its for a while at the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer from the repeti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and em@@ ulate pain to each mouse click .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also suffer from pain caused by the use of your computer if this is not yet done .
to clarify this again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click as soon as you break the motion briefly .
if the clever move is activated , it makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the mouse button is pressed . in this way you can execute the drag with pressed mouse button .
this residence time must be enough after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool .
if Intel@@ ligent displacement is enabled , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button , wait before it releases the mouse button again if no moving of the mouse takes place .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking through mouse @-@ postpon@@ ement . if this function is activated , a slow moving is generated to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with right mouse button . these movements are saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
when the sound appears , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . go to the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose Sound System and here the tab General . there is a slider sound buffer that you can set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; available . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically .
set all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the App@@ ly button , the settings will be reset to the stand after the last click .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , first with the default settings . in particular , the smart shifting you should let off first . if you have got used to the automatic mouse click , you can later take the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds .
first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not represent a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to take the mouse ball out . how this happens is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you &apos;d have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can easily scratch the dirt and dirt with a flat blade or f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the smart move in this case , that means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will stop the operation by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you are using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a different window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click . by this , the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will be reset and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor to where you want to have it . however , use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to make a ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke . this can cause an accidental moving of the mouse poin@@ ter . secure zones for the mouse cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the front lines of windows .
I try to work with the smart move , but I don &apos;t create it to edit text .
the clever move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very probably possible to select text , copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it again or execute any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice :
do not use the smart move if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . instead , select text instead : run a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . this is played every time , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button push@@ es a sound like a mouse click away . so you know exactly when the move time begins when it is smart . later , you can use the intelligent move even without the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X windows needs to be installed . this should be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse @-@ click is only available when the system has a sound card and loudspeaker and is correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; activate the mouse button as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor remains short . this program was developed for people suffering from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome and pain is causing pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to start a drag procedure before releasing the mouse button . in this way , dra@@ gging and dra@@ gging with the mouse can also be done .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that lets dum@@ b users talk to their computers for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history phrases that should be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) enter the command , which will later be used for the speech output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the default text pas@@ sage@@ . from the text@@ books you can often choose text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) , you determine the dictionary for the word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can query the word lists using an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be included in the word notation .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes of your pro@@ positions ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a running memory of the already spoken phrases ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
when you are running k@@ mouth , you can enter the sentences in the input field you want to hear . each spoken sentence is attached to the running memory . you can select sentences that are to be spoken again .
with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth , set up ... open the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; This dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the page word completion and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the flash@@ card voice output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection field below the input field , you specify the character encoding , with which text is passed on to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
you can use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service &amp; k@@ mouth ; first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the other settings will be ignored on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a standardized interface for voice output and is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the button short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the Text@@ pas@@ sage@@ book or in the Lei@@ ste for Text@@ pas@@ sage@@ books .
with the selection of So@@ fort , the chosen text passage is spoken directly and added to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text passage is entered only in the input field .
with the second drop @-@ down box of the editing window for text pass@@ book , you can specify whether the text pas@@ sage@@ book should be automatically saved when closing the edit window .
with the selection of text pas@@ sage@@ book , the book is saved . if you choose to make changes , the text pas@@ sage@@ book is not saved . select Before you ask , becomes &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ book is to be saved .
the dictionary page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word completion . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection box , you can select the currently used dictionary for word completion .
with the buttons on the right side of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field .
for this source , select the language you want ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of single words is simply determined by counting the file . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only correct words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth , then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option , you create a new , empty dictionary with no entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth , automatically add new words in the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main area of the window to edit text pas@@ sage@@ books is divided in two . in the upper part , the text pas@@ sage@@ books are represented as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the passage or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text pas@@ sage@@ book , you can only change its name .
add actions such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books either by selecting them in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or using a drop @-@ down menu .
the order of text pas@@ sage@@ books or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new position or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button .
the selected text is cut out and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory .
the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the storage memory .
the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected phrases of the running memory .
if this menu item is crossed , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the tool bar is arranged by default over the editing window directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
if this menu entry is enabled , a narrow strip is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is enabled , a sli@@ dable bar for text pas@@ sage@@ books with entries is displayed . by default , the tool@@ bar is placed directly under the tool bar above the editing window . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
you probably did not specify the command for the voice output correctly or not fully . open settings box ; set up the page General Settings and enter the command for voice output on the map speech output . ( see Settings dialog for voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers for further details . )
festival is a language edition system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows you to use the festival free of charge and to spread without any restrictions .
to display an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival . the command to voice output is :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and to spread without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ eh@@ et directory . the language output is then possible with one of the following commands :
for the third example , the option must be turned on as a standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to rip the text into phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax is pleased to send the last sign of the text so that an additional character must be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples :
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / host@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as a standard input must be enabled .
the voice output dem@@ on by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ wide voice service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice @-@ over@@ s .
since setting the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
to set up , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on the individual of your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that allows people who cannot speak , print text by the computer . a list of already spoken sentences is stored , which the user can always be re@@ published .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; not a speech synthes@@ izer . on your computer you have to install a speech synthes@@ izer .

on the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card card speaker will be displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the card card is displayed in general . see .
most T@@ TS @-@ Synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for a synthes@@ izer . you should at least set up a speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ops ; otherwise , the speed disc program otherwise uses the standard speaker .
different speakers for the same syn@@ th are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you click on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Flash@@ card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaker at kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card card speaker will be displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is yet set up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all speakers already set up will appear in this list . the preferred speakers will appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for voice output if there is no speaker to use .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
choose a tuning type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girl &apos;s voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the box . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can &amp; kt@@ ops ; almost use . go back to the card box and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled to allow the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can &amp; kt@@ ops ; use to read text messages . click on the card card orders to create and manage text orders . see .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start &amp; k@@ de the language output system . click on the map Le@@ ader@@ board General to open this card . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to enable the &amp; kt@@ ops ; system . this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this startup is successful , the card card will display orders and you can create text orders and let them read . see . remove the marking , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated .

it is almost always useful to select the desired text of a web page . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ tension@@ ers and other invisible marks are also read .
in &amp; kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read displayed text . first check if &amp; kt@@ ops ; run . then select the text that should be read , and select Tools to read Text in the main menu . then the voice output should begin .
this also works if &amp; Po@@ sts ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ not@@ fy is the information system of &amp; k@@ de ; you are notified about events that you have specified . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ops .
in &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up various types of messages ; for example , set up that you will be notified when a message appears in an IR@@ C channel in which your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ops ; you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
supported a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry appears in the menu Settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ not@@ fy vary depending on the application .
filters for drawing change provide a good way to correct and correct faulty messages . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is part of the scope of supply of &amp; kt@@ ops , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages that send K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , since it can be accepted in most cases as provided .
filters are one of the advanced features of &amp; kt@@ ops ; . for normal work with &amp; t@@ ts ; filters are not required .
filters are processed before being sent to the speech speech . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation , to replace false spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker , or to circum@@ vent certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the operation of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ops ; distinguishes four types of texts .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these jobs . if the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders will continue .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has preced@@ ence and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will resume after issuing the warning .
message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; read a long text on a website , you can go with &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also messages .
the rest are simple text orders . every order you apply from the card card is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the edition of longer texts , which have no special ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , except the output of screen re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen re@@ aders while &amp; kt@@ ops ; just one such read , this output will stop and stop .
first , you need to know that filters are never applied to screen readers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there may be further types of filters .
string replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be provided either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ops ; will be delivered with pre@@ defined string replacement filters that allow the creation of chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for format@@ ting messages from &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable way .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ops ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included for the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
with subscri@@ ber selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ops ; sent to a speaker for example . if you have selected a female voice for example , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules , to which it is applied for speech output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , it continues the text to the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; message to &amp; kt@@ am ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters installed on the bottom . processing by the filter is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed by the set up down@@ wards .
click here to add a new filter . select the type of filter , and the further below setup di@@ alogs are displayed .
if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be exchanged against the corresponding replacement text . large and lo@@ wer@@ case is not considered when compared .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you wish , it has to differ only from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Re@@ place . the list is processed in the shown order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list of a file , the entries from the file will be app@@ ended to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is applied only if the spokesperson for the text order speaks one of the languages listed here . click the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l button at the click of the mouse .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only enter a copy .
the filter replacement filter is applied to the text only if all the conditions with an entry in the Di@@ esen filter box apply when matching . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string release filter uses regular expressions in the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
in this manual you will find no instructions to write regular expressions . but if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions found in the package c@@ un@@ uti@@ ls .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ formers translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from one format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such form@@ ulations . it can only be used on well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the environment variable PA@@ TH , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
with the subscri@@ ber selection filter , you can send text to a particular speaker , which is set up on the card reader , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ops ; giving a text to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected using the narr@@ ator properties that speci@@ fies the program that sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ops ; sends , and the properties of the speakers appointed on the card card . with the subscri@@ ber selection filter , you can over@@ write the selected speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it with a click on the button to get help when entering .
in order to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker will be selected to meet the desired requirements . click on the button to the right to view the dialog .
use these buttons to save or load your subscri@@ ber settings or delete all settings .
the subscri@@ ber selection filter will only apply to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the Di@@ esen filter box if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice @-@ over@@ s API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with which program@@ mers can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the speech synthes@@ izer , can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ ops ; this synthes@@ izer can use .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice @-@ over@@ s API of &amp; k@@ de ; . see the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications call for voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d program to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
the text of the text for reading and option is a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands , enter

none of the mentioned speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers support my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my speech ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; conversion filter , but when using the module for festival websites , websites are not read .
due to a mistake in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so S@@ able works at all . you also need to do that if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the environment variable PA@@ TH .
certain notes or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks appear to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only che@@ wing cat@@ chy . what can I do against it ?
first make sure that the option character encoding is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be fixed by a string replacement filter . see .

speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; t@@ p ; for the use of another synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter but is not absolutely necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile , you need a current K@@ DE development environment ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the k@@ deli@@ bs packages and development files for the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have the source code of &amp; kt@@ ops ; get from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ dness or have downloaded the tar@@ ball currently created every night , and install the program with the following commands :
before using &amp; kt@@ ops , first check if the speech synthes@@ izer works correctly with your speech synthes@@ izer . to do this , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops ; the t@@ ms@@ gr utility is designed to be developed so that the setup of speech cl@@ adding is possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is de@@ composed into single sentences . the user can leave sentences or paragra@@ phs , repeat , stop or cancel the output .
if an application passes text to &amp; kt@@ ops , it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for output . for example , if you have set up a speaker , whose language English and its gender is female , this is used , otherwise the best matching speaker will be chosen . if you want to learn more about how &amp; t@@ ts ; choose a speaker , look for .
if you click on the box to add a speaker to the list , and in order for a speaker to insert into the list or click Edit , the card reader device will be shown . as an example , the module of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below . details about the modules can be found here .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in PA@@ TH , you only have to enter festival .
select the character encoding for text that is passed to the festival . for voices , the &amp; kt@@ ops ; known , this setting is made automatically . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these slider lets you adjust volume , speaking speed , and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some controls and this gray is displayed , the voice you selected does not allow these settings to be displayed .
some voices such as multi @-@ sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with larger memory consumption ) the first movement is synthes@@ ized more quickly .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forget to click App@@ ly ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window is displayed at the start of kt@@ m@@ gr the program window . otherwise , after the start , only the kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr icon in the system section is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ m@@ gr is not yet running , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this gives you the opportunity to stop reading or otherwise control .
here are all orders listed in the queue , along with the application that set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the straight edited set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card card speaker .
with the buttons in this row , you can move forward or backward in the order selected in the list below . ( but not every job consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK all changes of the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also .
here , only text orders are listed and managed . issues of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . for more information on the message types of &amp; kt@@ ops , click here .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , it has been &amp; kt@@ ops ; either compiled or t@@ art@@ ing without support for the respective audio module ; may not load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module .
adjust the speaking speed here . 50@@ 6 ; % corresponds to approximately half and 200@@ 00 ; % about the double normal speaking speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click App@@ ly to adopt the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to find out which device works with you . in doubt , select Standard .
on this card card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ops ; processes four types of language orders :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . once the output of the screen reader has been read , the retained orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will resume after reading the warning .
messages have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you are &amp; eg ; just leave a long text on a website , you can go with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who is entering the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , the audio output is added to the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the introductory sound and the introductory message are active , the introductory sound is played before the incoming message .
the settings on this card are valid only for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the output of screen readers there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ops , please start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . the card card noti@@ fications appear .
check this check box to disable &amp; k@@ de read notification . if this setting is not checked , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ops ; do not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played is not read by &amp; kt@@ ops ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message .
all events for which nothing else is specified in the list are ignored ; ignored .
use this drop @-@ down field to specify what &amp; t@@ ts ; do when an event meets . you have the following choices :
if you have selected custom text , enter the text you want . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter the desired subscri@@ ber &apos;s properties here . default will select the speaker that appears in the list on the list of speakers as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it is executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the specific application .
the event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this purpose , you can specify the noti@@ fications to be read as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications to a file . use the button Lo@@ ad to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events are merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to highlight text for voice output . this standard includes trademarks for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ops ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are present :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British man@@ ly ) as this is the standard voice , the festival uses in the output of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or sound in the festival configuration dialog are not limited to 100 , SS@@ ML is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds can switch text into single sentences . thus , you can start or stop or stop orders quickly on the card card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not directly support this .
here you see the pro@@ posi@@ tional boundary recognition filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ops , a set del@@ im@@ iter filter filter is set up as default . you can change its settings or add another set of rules filters , beginners will be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the easiest way to learn how to set the subscri@@ ber selection by trying out . switch the subscri@@ ber sel@@ ector and enter text to read . switch to the box selection again , change some features and check how the speaker &apos;s selection is changed .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; then proceed faster with reading , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can take very long ,
you can apply text orders on the card card or cancel orders even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the regular line recognition filter is set up automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be shut off , only removed . do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing .
pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab mark ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the pro@@ posi@@ tional boundaries . ( tab marks are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders .
if you have removed the normal set del@@ im@@ iter filter by mistake , you can insert it again by up@@ loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subscri@@ ber &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; card menu , you can over@@ ride the subscri@@ ber settings for the application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the card reader ) . in other words : no speech characteristics are specified .
use of the most appropriate speaker with all the features of a furnished speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , choose &amp; edit ; otherwise select &amp; t@@ t ; the speaker that best matches the original features .
select the method to enter the desired subscri@@ ber properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the subscri@@ ber here . if this feature does not play a role , do not enter anything .
tick this check box if the property is to take preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set several marks here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this property . the only case you may want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application text is sent in a different language than the one in the working environment .
to use all the features in the speaker area , which is most likely to er@@ ase the following , click the standard speaker button and then use the speaker that best matches the following .
in this case 0 for the last text order is in the queue . you can also specify a job number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr crashes immediately when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I do not get trac@@ e@@ ability .
G@@ Stre@@ amer has crashed and &amp; kt@@ ops ; it was finished . probably you need to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not resolved , it is possible to install a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output over AL@@ SA doesn &apos;t work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I hold a text order , freezes and kt@@ ops ; a message that says : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
on your system there is a problem that conflicts with AL@@ SA are occurring that prevent concur@@ rent opening of several PC@@ M devices . see the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ m@@ gr shows this voice not .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / ect@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / vocals . as guidance you can use the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; on which you found the voice to the developer .
on the map audio there is a setting speed . so this works , the program needs to be installed so@@ x and be discover@@ able by the environment variable PA@@ TH . some Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ Mod@@ ules such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed even on the card card for subscri@@ ber unit . depending on the selected voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for speaking speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ops ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; after &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML form@@ er@@ filter , and set up the speaking speed .
I don &apos;t create websites with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker but &amp; kt@@ ops ; reads the websites with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not appear to work . so that festival does not produce any errors , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects the GEN@@ DER tags . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a separate chain replace filter and now I can in &amp; kt@@ ops ; no more I can move forward or go back . on the prec@@ urs@@ or of orders is shown , the order is only composed of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
you may not filter pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question marks , ex@@ clamation marks , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . instead , use a filter for set limit detection instead .
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure the modules are inde@@ xed for gam@@ bl@@ ers by calling in &amp; kt@@ ats before using G@@ Stre@@ amer . ( HTTP : / / stream@@ er.@@ fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org )
some users experience conflicts in the audio output in connection with AL@@ SA . if your system counts , you can not simultaneously play music and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ops ; also freezes when you stop a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) website .
as of July 2005 , a@@ Co@@ de does not yet support real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ops , the current set is still being read .
the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of speaking speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x using the apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included .
you have &amp; kt@@ ops ; downloaded as tar@@ ball ( with tar packed archive ) , register as normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . change to this folder and enter the following commands :
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only created on request .
the following modules for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a run@@ time depen@@ dency of non @-@ free software . ( not @-@ free according to the Deb@@ ian distribution guidelines ) .
as default , &amp; kt@@ ops ; in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 is installed . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = target option . for example ,
on Deb@@ ian systems , / usr / local is the right folder for programs that are translated from the sources .
CD k@@ ett@@ ts@@ d &gt; in@@ st @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd kt@@ ts@@ d make su make install
before using &amp; kt@@ ops , first check if your voice synthes@@ izer works correctly . follow the instructions you received with the synthes@@ izer .
festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported . in many voices you can adjust volume , speaking speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ops .
you must install at least one language . help can be found in the instructions provided with the Festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer .
the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices you need to enter the voice MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . look for the first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option code must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the option code must be set to an 8 bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer . then Festival takes over lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; not a complete voice transmission system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ phon files . you need additional software to create this Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be created from German text di@@ phones .
in this procedure additional wra@@ pper code is added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files to voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; file , but in the Fol@@ der festival / lib / . instructions can be found at :

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which allows administration of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a series of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selection from K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple interface for the user :
after the installation , a new module network settings are displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displayed . the network settings module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting from k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in the &amp; K@@ Menu ; start .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware is not able to install . physical devices and their drivers have to be installed and configured so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all displays and the setting of network properties is possible .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices when installing &amp; Linux are installed and set up . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files according to the kernel version :
the network settings module is loaded when the option network settings are selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting the module network settings , this system attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list that best meets the distribution and the release edge . by marking the setting of non @-@ re @-@ en@@ quiries , the definition can be made permanently . the next start of the network settings will then automatically set this selection .
changing the network settings is possible only in system management mode . before , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can be viewed only , changing is not possible . in system management mode , you can enter system management mode at the lower end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three tab@@ s :
the tab Network interfaces are used to manage the system &apos;s network devices . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the tab Network Interface :
the settings displayed on the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button of the button ... to set up in the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to display the dialog with further options .
with automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are performed at the same time with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP settings for each system start , so no further adjustment is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the option Manu@@ ell , the TCP / IP configuration can be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the IP address input field the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the network mask , the sub @-@ net@@ mask must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface during bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole ; you can see if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on the needs . switching on an out@@ dated network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on the needs . turn off an enabled network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
speci@@ fies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with hosts in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network where the gateway computer is located must be selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer requires ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS triggers this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution calcul@@ ator can be used to easily manage this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be added to priority by selecting an entry and gra@@ ding in the list with buttons Hin@@ ts or Her@@ oes .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution you can add a DNS server . it will display the New Name Server dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... It will display the dialog editing .
the name of name known by name describes the host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address ID for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used by bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , remote networks it can replace DNS servers .
usually the list includes some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host ap@@ os ; and support some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test version of IP should replace version 4 in the future version .
enter the IP address of the known calcul@@ ator and click Add ... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
enter the name of the known calcul@@ ator and click the Add button . if the known calcul@@ ator has multiple alias names , press the add multiple times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a name known by name from the list and select Edit ... Open the Friends machine will appear .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system . to enable the changes , the following command must be set in a &amp; console .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ist ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the ready @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; install rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool for your distribution .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is not sufficient , but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given ; in the second section all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf are discussed ; changing configuration files will be discussed .
this section cannot replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is conveyed .
IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found great dis@@ semination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to be consistent in the near future . therefore , this description is currently focusing on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is to assign . in external networks , on the pi@@ er , the network administrator is the contact person who runs a valid IP address or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address can not be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network .
of course , access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ 49 ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this part , you will find the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed dynamically with DSL connections , so it won &apos;t be surprised if there is another content to be found there in case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is re @-@ sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected may therefore occur .

&amp; dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it provides the ability to create multiple archives on one tape . the first one was to create a surface for tar , which additionally provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective extrac@@ ting . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife put : how much longer does it take to secure ?
before a band can be used , it must be involved from &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways :
&amp; dat ; ult the band back and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t know the advance on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted .
detects &amp; dat ; it searches for the right index on your disk . if this is not found , you will be asked if the belt index is to be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes in order to indicate that the tape was embedded . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the content of the tape can now be brow@@ sed by folding the entry for the tape .
before casting the strap , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; dat ; by changing the symbol for the band to recognize that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to save data . this process does not match format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; If your tape drive needs to be format@@ ted before use , this must happen before you can be format@@ ted by the tape from &amp; k@@ dat ; flo@@ ppy tape drives usually require format@@ ting the tape , DA@@ T drives on the other hand .
after entering the band name and capacity , the tape continues . all the data on the tape is lost ! after completing the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and ready for use .
before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only backup this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the files and / or sub@@ folders selected will be backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save ...
once the backup has been initiated , the dialog opens up for backup . in this dialog , you can check once again the selected files and change the settings for backup .
when you confirm the settings , the dialog appears . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
ri@@ ght@@ click in one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
once the check process has been started , the dialog appears for verification . in this dialog , you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for review .
if you have confirmed the review settings , the dialog appears . this dialog will show the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can re @-@ establish the restore , the files to be restored must be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive entry . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives using a tick . only the files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
ri@@ ght@@ click a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore ....
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog appears for recovery . in this dialog , you can check your selection once again and change the job folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the settings for the restoration , the dialog appears again . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to recre@@ ate the band inde@@ x@@ file using the band content . this process cle@@ ars all existing index files for this volume . you can create the index on two types of the tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current job folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected folder .
for all folders listed under backup files , only the files in it are backed up that are located on the same fil@@ esystem as the folder . folders that are on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be entered separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before the tar call . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files had not yet been fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be done :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
this setting is active , transmitted &amp; dat ; before the tape is incorporated , the command blocks load to the drive . in some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; lock the cast off the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is enabled , it will automatically disc@@ ard the tape when resol@@ ving the integration of &amp; k@@ dat . do not use this option on flo@@ ppy @-@ flo@@ ppy disks .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; to change the hardware @-@ like block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must tell &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , the block size for your tape drive .
when &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only show a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the period in which the tape was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system supports the various protocol files . moreover , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users access quick access to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users to understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified presentation of the protocol files of your system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the various protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log allows experienced users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore attempts to provide some advanced features , with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , it provides &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; features available to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a log file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start &amp; k@@ system@@ log , first the most important log file of the system - the system log - will open . if you don &apos;t display it , and it opens up instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; most likely do not run with system administrator rights . the protocol files are usually found in the / var / log file , for which normal users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter by selecting a selected criterion or string . the list of the log lines will now be changed automatically so that only log lines will be displayed . in default , a log line will be displayed only if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns .
you can , of course , select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the appropriate column . in addition , in the Protocol file system protocol , select the column process , and apply in the fil@@ ter@@ bar the name of a process , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of the level error are displayed with a more noticeable color than protocol lines of the level hint . the colored representation of protocol lines can be shut down setup dialog .
for example , if you want to display a specific process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can show the process identification ( PID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use the filter bar .
in addition , you can jump to new lines in the main window context menu to view all the new log lines added .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub @-@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find further information about the Sour@@ ces of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also found in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and so named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the system V In@@ it quickly becomes the standard for controlling the program start when running the system in the &amp; Linux ; this is because it is easier to use , more powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it .
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re @-@ format@@ ting . that &apos;s why you need to make sure the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs also from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for each system service that you want to start when running the system or switching to another run@@ level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; send@@ mail ; system services , on the other hand , do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only launched once . such calls are to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file even if there is not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port when you start up .
the kernel searches in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one that it finds .
the default all @-@ level is in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default all @-@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab from hand and change the 3 . be very careful if you have mess@@ ed up the in@@ it@@ tab .
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains a K , the script is called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be inv@@ oked with the argument start .
some people want to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; have a server run@@ level which can run only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . in addition , I could also have a user run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc .
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or other hand device is easy to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ levels to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between levels or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . in doing so , the entry is removed from its original run@@ level ( or position ) . this only happens if you pull out an entry from the range of available system services .
note : entries are moved if you move them to a new area . in order to only copy them to a new level , you must explicitly choose to copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert them into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : there is currently no way to restore entries thrown into the Recy@@ cle Bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the different work areas ( Avail@@ able System Services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones .
to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with inser@@ tion ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or name of an entry manually , press the input key to open the Properties dialog . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of loss of data , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if available . otherwise , they are recovered by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with standard run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine starts to restart . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the / etc / in@@ it@@ tab file and change the standard run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; intended for running Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE , or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are launched in these distri@@ butions makes it easy to configure for the proprietary set @-@ up programs of these distri@@ butions but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution , please check if all configuration files are available that are needed by the system service ( and whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply quit without a message if their configuration files are not available or set incor@@ rectly .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that they can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to begin reading .
after you have made any changes you need to save them . either you use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or save the item in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or the desired group with double click on the entry . it appears the dialog for user and group properties .
some flash@@ cards are displayed only if you have advanced system settings . only if you have enabled limited restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings . other cards may appear if Shadow -@@ passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD domains .
the card @-@ card password management appears in case of Shadow -@@ passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD domains .
this card card only appears if for at least one fil@@ esystem space constra@@ int ( quot@@ a ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , with the limited space limitations each data in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current fil@@ esystem is selected with the help of the field fil@@ esystem with space constraints .
the card card groups informs about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the default group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ mary group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field .
the group dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group or click the appropriate Add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works analogue .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot the default operating system , add , remove , add , add , remove , change , and more .
