<seg id="1">Translate the module web page in & konqueror; translate the menu under Extras website. select the starting and target language of the translation from the drop-down list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If part of the text is selected, only this part is translated at the point of the whole & URL;</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is only very rudimentary. babelfish in the best case produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations should not make any important decisions depending on the translation before.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated at the Babelfish page, where you can insert translated text directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; includes various modules for & konqueror; despite its small size, they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror; by making them more readily available.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information on the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual to & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, select settings extensions set up.... Open the card card tools and select the desired modules there.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of default settings from the box; addons. please note that possibly more modules on your system are installed if you have installed additional software.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click on the & konqueror; on extras crashes. then you can view the page, the & konqueror, or drop the list of crashes if available.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module Annex Filter (also called Folder Filters) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras address filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default, the display starts with the root node of the document, Example: DVI element, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory in local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the inferior objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">With & FSView, the size of a file or folder reflects the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it. in this way, large files can be easily recognized even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy. accordingly, & FSView may be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you are considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView, an entry in the Treemap diagram is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your file system. for easier navigation, the rectangles have sensible colour recognition and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched over view color mode, can either represent depth for easy detection of the nesting depth or the image of a different file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is sufficient space to display or whether the area of subordinate rectangles should occur. furthermore, you can specify the relative position of caption in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">For display algorithms for Treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. in case of the Treemap in & FSView, this target is not always respected. it is used to draw parameters that are no longer available for subordinate entries. note that less space is lost for the frame when the square is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How division of the surface of an entry for the subordinate entries is done, the implementation remains left to the implementation. here, it is always advantageous for labelling and avoidance of space losses through framework, that rectangles are created that are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns or recursive branches.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimum shown area for an entry on the menu item View on area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn to the surface of the higher-level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally, & FSView was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widgets developed for the KCachegrind application.</seg>
<seg id="23">The module Picture Gallery can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras image gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you access the module image gallery, a dialog opens, which allows you to set the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "the" "" "Title" "" "option allows you to customize the title of the image gallery page in a text entry field." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The images per line has a slider and a rotation field to set the number of thumbnails of each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "with the" "" "View" "" "file name of the image, you specify whether the filenames are displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">With the file size check box size of the image, you specify whether the file size is displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the image size check box, you specify whether the size of the images is displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the dialog folder you specify where the gallery is stored and which subfolders are to be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Save in HTML file, specify where the HTML page is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the sub-folder check box, you can set up with a slider or a turn field, to which level the subfolders will be included.</seg>
<seg id="33">You can copy the original pictures to the gallery using the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="34">Using the comment file check box, you can specify a comment file for describing the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">You can specify a different color depth for the thumbnails as in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; Settings allows you to easily access the general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The Media Playback for the navigation pane can be found in the & konqueror; View menu under Windows Navigation Section or with the F9 shortcut shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the navigation area of the & konqueror; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Changing browser detection adds a menu entry in & konqueror; in addition, you can change browser and operating system identifiers for single domains. this is helpful for web pages that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The standard browser detection of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you are denied access to this browser, change browser detection to one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the password in MSIE for pages that reject access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need the MSIE browser detection to access with the & konqueror; hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use their own & HTML; - Elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this obsolete browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the inserted browser detection is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the menu entry... you can adjust the amount of information on the used browser and operating system in the individual.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digitally; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digikam; includes quick image editing with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the editing capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE image plugins interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digikam, it is easy to use, it provides dozens of professional skills. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by libraw, DNG-export and ICC colour management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with considerably more metadata, such as & eg; via the camera or lens that can be searched for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs are also digitized; an open source project. that means, it depends on the support of end users. you should therefore report problems and improvement possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="60">& nbsp; tries to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu provides a page in the error report system. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the error report system.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project supported by a community. that means that the user and developer will help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to invite you to other users of & digikam. you can ask here questions to other users of & digikam. in this mailing list, however, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also check the digicam; visit homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best way to get involved is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for logging in to the developer mailing list by & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you first start, you'll be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database. you can specify a local, remote or removable folder. simply type the path name or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data abnk is stored. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digikam; will also be used as an old library.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder that contains pictures, as base folder. & digikam; view every subfolder as an album. no image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="68">& nbsp; During recursively the library path in its full depth. you cannot exclude sub-folders unless it iste in hidden folder. this can be done exhalbs & digikam; complete a point in front of the subfolder's name.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have any photos as symbols. you can change this by using any photo from the album and discard it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and My Playing iste to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">The support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the help of raw camera support.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the Roh DecoderSettings and Roh workflow sections.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digitally; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera then appears as a disk drive. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">Digi2 is a free, extendable software collection for digital cameras, which supports an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and are slow regarding the serial port, this connection is now obsolete. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found at this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support to reliably read the thumbnails of digiKam. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, thumbnails may not be seen or the creation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the nicest things to do is how easy it is to expand its functionality through modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plug-ins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as it can be a user. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digikam; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes came in & digikam; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the page strings with & LMB, or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop images works everywhere: you can place an image in another part of the old tree, above the horizontal partition line or in another application window. the only limitation is that a picture can not be placed in keywords, date list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. thus, the filtern functions on the file name only if this ind the symbol view is also displayed. which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the AlbenSettings.</seg>
<seg id="85">The View & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos that are managed by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive, after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was first created.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have created a scanner you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select album Imports images to scan. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album. select album Imports screen shot.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop there. in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album properties, right-click on the album and select album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos if you want to select or delete albums by collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do so in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with View albums Folder Date.</seg>
<seg id="91">Buttons Elders, Average, New Year: these set the date to the oldest, the newest picture or section of the album. this first tries to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first open an album in & quot; open, the first picture will be selected in the album as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album symbol, you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu & quot; As Albumvorschauenquot; select. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">Album collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window provides you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images will be shown in this album in the screen. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two loupe buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">If you open an album the first time, you need to wait for a moment while the thumbnails will be generated. you can avoid this in which you can recreate all preview images in the Extras menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information about each image will be displayed below the thumbnail. what information this is, you can change over settings digicam; set up. select the albums page and adjust the thumbnail area to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help window which appears. if you let the mouse cursor rest for a moment over a picture. the help displays the most important features including all tags of a photo. the screenshot above in the section Introduction to the main window shows such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all the thing about digikam; goes. albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it fits you. image editing displays your photos and allows you to accomplish a number of improvements to this. you can reach all the functions that came with & digicam; you can choose between viewing the images, a slide show or the editing of the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by using either F4 Image editing... or select the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit... to edit your photos. with image editing, you can view your photos and change them.</seg>
<seg id="102">It may happen that & digikam; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in a different program by right-clicking the context menu and select the program from the submenu of opening. this, and how you adapt them to your needs, you will find information in & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing by other image editing programs, problems with the metadata contained in the picture may not work. some programs do not store these data with when you store the modified image. this will result in loss of information from EXIF and IPTC data such as orientation, aperture etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digikam; provides two ways to rotate. the easiest way is to rightclick the preview and select rotate. in the sub-menu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right-click on the preview and select F2 Rename from the context menu. keep in mind that you maintain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc.).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo and delete it, it will be moved to the garbage dump of & kde; move. F8 Photo Delete or Del if you'd rather want to delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">The View & quot; My dates listing; organize your photos on the basis of the data. & quot; use either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of the last change of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the datasheet below in the data view so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search again.</seg>
<seg id="110">When a keyword is selected, all the photos that have been marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My Keywordlist. so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keywords in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG, so you can also use your keywords in other programs.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking either on & quot; My Keywortequot; or click on an existing keyword and then choose New Keyword. if you have clicked on an existing keyword, this keyword will be the substitchword of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting deletion. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword, drag it to the desired position in the tree and place it there. then a menu appears that gives you the option to postpone the keyword. a keyword can only be once in a tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by right-clicking and selecting the keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keywords.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album symbol, you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select as album preview in the context menu. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">This can be done in two ways: once you select the photos you want to provide with a keyword, you can drag it to the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keywords'. alternatively, you can also rightclick on the preview of the pictures and select from the context menu keyword.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can add a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be displayed once you select one of the words assigned to it. in this way you can set a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event at which it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keywords, it will appear in the main window under the preview.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword using the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select from the tag menu. the menu only shows the keywords that were assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view displays a time-dependent histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved over this histogram. to select a time frame, you just have to click on the bottom rectangle of the radio box indicating the time unit. this will display all the associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below you can enter a title and save your selection. this will then appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Include all elements of the database: names, reviews, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and more in the future.</seg>
<seg id="125">If you click here, the filtering will be deleted and all images will be displayed again. if the search has not found, then the lamp will be red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side bar with the binoculars. if you open this, you can save a simple search box as described above. you can however save this search here as a live search, which always filters that which you have entered as a search criterion. after you have been saved, it appears in the list.</seg>
<seg id="127">When you are satisfied with your selection, press OK and the search will be performed. the results are displayed in my search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection after searching, you just have to select the appropriate entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you select to edit search, the search form will appear again with the previously entered search information. if you select as an advanced search, the Advanced Search dialog appears to change your previous search.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select the search context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search provides you with an extended search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of & digikam; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Albendatabase. all rules are added by line, by operators. an option can be added to this list with search group / search group. additionally, you can create search of type & quot; AND NICHTquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digikam; characterizes each image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this makes it possible to compare images by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two picture signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area in which you can drop any picture to find a similar. by means of a swellist the choice of results can be enlarged or reduced. if you push a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can drop it down there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free-hand colour sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digikam; find the right pictures. here too, a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble Mini program. you can move in or zoom with the mouse wheel or move it. push Ctrl; left mouse button to pull a square. all images inside these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo filter. this will then be added for a later use of the list below. it works like a live geofolder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digikam; provides a lamp table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Dem Lightable add from the context menu. the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window opened. if you are back in & edited; main window, you can quickly open the illuminated table with L Extras illuminated.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the thumbnail, you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window and place it there. a small arrow tells you which copy in which window area is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly sort out of a series of images. if you use pair mode navigating from the toolbar, then the two first images are automatically loaded into the same areas for comparisons. use now the left mouse button on any preview screen to display it in the right area. this simplifies it to work through a number of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, normal solder actions also work directly from the beam like e.g. F4 file...</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the main window sidebar is available for both preview images in the illuminated table. this makes it easy to connect visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in pivot function that you can see at the crossed arrows. in order to rotate the visible area of the picture, you must click on them and hold the & LMB. in the preview, both pictures will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zooming works just as in other views. simply use the zoom knobs below the pictures or ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both pictures when you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital stock management - away from the fashion word? digital stock management considers every part of the process that follows after the picture has been taken up to final output and permanent storage. each of the photos absorbs, scans or stores digital photos leads to a form of digital inventory management. most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient manner.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips as you can back up your images, find, protect, and use photos again. we will focus on the procedures for digital photographers the & digikam. we will consider the download, rename, remove, convert, group, back, optimize, wait and export image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital asset management takes on, indexed, categorized, secures, searches, transformed, confectioned and exports contents which have a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is, according to your definition, data that provide information about or documentation of other data administered by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to claim that if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer then you do not need to find a specific photo without stock management. if you do not even know how many photos you have, then use it not & digikam;. the approach to store the metadata in both a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searching and a secure archiving on which you can freely access other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you care about anything in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you need to decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc. make sure you have to switch to a larger drive at some point.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly through your location, unless you were in a year several times in the same place. if you do enough photos then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. then you will be able to export a folder for images you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">Which types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and work files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the option of saving metadata in the settings page of the metadata in & digikam; it ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the respective item in the album's menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what? to do so, it provides a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are, of course, the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, since you should assign each photo to keywords, labels and an evaluation. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then. this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos in the further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's now use keywords, keywords, as you often call other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digikam will automatically build the tree for you or insert the pictures to the right place. changing the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dragging a sub-tree to another.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is overlapping. this is a very coarse representation since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to descriptions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to let anyone see your photos just, you want to share them with your friends, family, photographers and agencies.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer, you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you this of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you start dreaming of having associations, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence. so the lettering has completely changed your perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others that view your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help Him over the motive that you have moved has to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It's fine if a picture is not perfect if it's the strength only to work with a lettering for itself.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam, you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as a label. KDE even provides a spellchecker. if you export your pictures in web galleries, then these labels will not tell you a second time according to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times ahead of GPS? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system? wasn't it Earth a boring Planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now runs with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to exploit the geolocation are already innumerable and will be even deeper in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your journeys using images with geographical data. & nbsp; can also export kml files that you can open with Google Earth.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a wordplay with copyright and denotes the practice of using copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, i.e. also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the setup page of & digikam; as information should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should include your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for the author line): linked to the author. this field contains the work description of the photographer. examples of this can be as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Editor (synonym for providers): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others. if the picture is a bearing photo, then the group / agency that offers the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections although they do not offer protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than base knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify this information embedded in the picture. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">Digital watermark is unique per picture. & digikam; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record errors, disk failures, electric shocks, ECC, transmission errors, aging of the storage media, restoration, redundancy, desastation prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, spread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we do not talk about CDs that were lost on the street or on a fire. these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section, it is about problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll OnTrack, the largest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, these must be treated cautiously and you may not be trusted more than a few years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archived quality, which last longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold-coated DVDs, & Dollar; 2 the piece which claims a lifetime of 100 years.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and storing them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable to errors, even if they have just been written. that's why they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data is only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and the checksums. despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust, etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there is a cheap program called IsoBuster that apparently works wonders for CDs and DVDs. it runs on Windows and & Linux; but it's not available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to win the format war against the HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray disk can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that was said about CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Do not burn the media with a description, date & author and then store it on a clean, dark dry and protected site. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers retain their stats for themselves. their manufacturing warrants include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives on this subject.</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: disks are the longest if they are operated at 35 ° C to 45 ° C in the Temperature range. electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason, SMART cannot detect these errors.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have saved the files, but these losses can normally be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices do not make much noise, this can cause serious damage in devices with computer chips and high-speed processes. these can cause serious damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause serious keyboards, complete data loss, hardware aging, destroyed motherboards and other defects. protect yourself from the unavoidable loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against current tips is a surge protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of the energy heat and avoids the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug-in bar. remember, however, that not every plug-in bar also contains overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. it guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also make sure that it provides protection against lightening and therefore protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are also protected. some manufacturers provide overvoltage shakers which also have a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are designed specifically for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While a surge protection system protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you with a complete failure. even an omission of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a uninterruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the protection against overvoltage, these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs. some models even allow them to continue working until the current runs out. if you buy a UPS then you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements as overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in current problems with the cost of avoiding these. a high-quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 20 costs, A 500W USV you can get for less than & euro; this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it. at the end, you should always remember all the cables before going on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can use it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are, however, very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send the data via the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solution is therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are provided on photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">Web solutions are very secure from the point of view of data backup. due to the TCP protocol, transmission errors are automatically cleaned and the large companies included in the offer a backup and a distributed storage.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine. all transfers are prone to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing about it is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all these disturbances are undiscovered until you one day open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise. it's quite disturbing that there is no protection in your computer. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate interference within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. in 2010, you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with record errors on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one of the GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched its own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. it is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms the ZFS is used and is also available for & Linux; however, it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in the notebook and 46% of the workplace systems. in case of notebooks the proportion of thefts is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it causes minor damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; nobody has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the widest filesystems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigative process at a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft, and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical boundaries. it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristic for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is worse. a sensor size of 6 megapixels and a high-quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixel. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard disk today for 100 & euro; so you don't have to worry anyone else for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected every year by a data loss. therefore, secure your data according to a plan and test this backup before you make any hazardous like the reinstallation of your operating system, the exchange of disks or the resizing of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups on an external SATA drive daily. if, then one day, a flash will hit you if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes local and destroys a lot. forget your airspace: fire, water, electricity, children and thefts are dangerous for your data. they usually affect a whole room or entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore desaster prevention is always a non-local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs, into the neighbouring house, into your office or anything like that.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above, a common cause for data loss despite backup is the panic. if you have a backup that is not available immediately, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files that should be secured. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the last differential backup.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. generates several snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time in which such a backup has been made.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts rsync only rsync the difference of files that have really been changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to DVD or other optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure lets you discover and restore losses. at the same time you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the work files. in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original retained, memory, scalability, media, reviewing images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual devices,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the time period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you need to consider all that is being said today with caution and re-evaluate while time passes. unfortunately, there is no other way to be considered a certain vigilance. the less variations you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered with the explanation in this document. use or change open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to read your images, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the technical expression for the ability to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have set up the scalability and want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. in * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and shift it to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg whether your new record has been detected by the system, but don't impose it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& Dollar; dd if = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollar; Parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; disk size in MBM; # works with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & Dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of disk if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the major advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software that can read it, you can create them yourself.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard that should replace GIF. it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per colour channel and full transparency. PNG can store gamma- and chromaticity data for improved color allocation for heterogeneous platforms.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF is stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. with some cameras you can save your pictures in this format. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG's digital Negative file format is a license-free and open format format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope that the competitor Canon and Nikon will use it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Image Resources Block quot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a coding technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format. XMP fits, since it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems in connection between the metadata file and the image file, and as mentioned above, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put it all together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organisation dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a large range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to gain a broad acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or scanner. as long as the images on the camera screen are, you can use this as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine-layered processing, you can use external programs. if you edit the images with & digikam again, then you should add the metadata again. these were actually cut off from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited pictures for copyright with a digital watermark. export them only in webgaleries, code in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digikam; in the addition of a photo to an album you will find a description of how you can add photos that you have already on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing pictures to your Albendatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digicam; to use, connect them to the computer, turn the camera on the display mode and switch it. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it attempts to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a hex indicator will appear at the bottom end and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera will appear. some cameras don't display thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog features file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The tab metadata shows the internal metadata such as EXIF, manufacturer notes, GPS, etc. of the image. this information is the same as in the metadata side bar from the main window of & digikam; or image editing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is to download the click on the download button and then download the selection of All. this downloads all photos from their camera into one album in & digikam;. when downloading, the photos will not be deleted and we recommend checking if the pictures were securely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can only select the desired selection of & kde; once you have selected the photos, use the download button and then download Selected. download the selected button until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New Download is available. these images have not yet been downloaded by & digikam. in this case, the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you want to download the buttons all or download Selected albums, a dialog with which you can select the target album is displayed in which the photos are stored. the list of existing albums is displayed in the My Albums section. select the destination album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have selected the target album, press OK, and & edited; download the photos from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once by deleting the delete button. if you want to delete only a few, you must select it first and delete the selected deleted.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to restore images that you deleted from the camera. the photos are not moved to the garbage dump of & kde; they should be checked carefully before you delete them from the camera. if you want to completely delete the camera, you should do this via the camera name, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras often use not particularly meaningful names as filenames. the filenames are normally recycled after the photos are deleted from the camera. this can result in double file names if you load photos from different recording galleries into the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time on which the image was made to include the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for turning and mirroring the image and file-based subtitles. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created per day automatically.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the commit opens up three more options that are executed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two relate to the information about the author in the standard Autoridentity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries from the Exif information are copied to the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want another date format than the standard format, e.g. in the edit field, you can use the prefix foto-% Y-% m-% d% H:% S. switch to the date & time option. for further adjustments you should read the help of the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">"" "if you are using the" "" "Camera File" "" "option, you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters. or, in uppercase, if you prefer this." ""</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digikam; for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming will be saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digikam; can use all information on orientation of the camera to the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during download. not all cameras provide this information. in the Metadata section, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">Automatic rotation is usually turned on, and if your camera does not deliver this information, it is digitized; the photo is in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the Advanced button and select automatic rotation in the lower area of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date in which the photo was taken, can & digikam; this sub-albums are based on the image data. all images with the same date are uploaded into the same subversion. not all cameras provide this information. in the section page bar meta data, you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually turned off, and in this case, & digikam; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you must turn this option off. use the Advanced button and select the date-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button. then select Uploading. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files that should be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the default & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, ask & digikam; you where the images should be uploaded. a folder selection dialog appears for the camera. select the folder you want and press OK to upload the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. it refers to a position indicated in latitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. the identification of the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers, it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to cartography an area through automatic recording of the GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser with a click that displays the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & nbsp; users who want to locate the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, semitrailings and map references. so, the question is actually more, how the data comes into these fields? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the correct hardware, about reprocessing the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographic mapping (manual) and last about manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few that work with GPS receivers. either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you must save these data in gpx format as this is the only format supported by the geographic mapping module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows, and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of images and from the GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data then you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the accidentals of hairy coordinates created for example by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show any European street maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digikam; try to give you as much control over its workflow as you can. there are many settings that change the behaviour of & digikam. to access these settings, you need to edit the Settings menu in eight pages. you can switch between these by clicking on the icons on the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action on embedded preview or start image editing. you set the default behavior of & digikam; establish if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option was selected for downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for author line: this field should include the professional title of the photographer. this can be designations such as hired photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a closer description of the car, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Editor is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify which the photo offers. this does not have to be the author, if it works for a news agency, such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here as this represents the picture to others & quot;. if the picture is a bearing photo, then the group or agency that provides the picture will be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC rims. this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not just in the database of & digikam; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported in & digikam; imported without losing.</seg>
<seg id="289">Captions as embedded captions (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the pictures. this allows your captions to be read by other image viewers.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse cursor stays in the main window over a file. depending on the option selected, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digikam; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify what file types & digikam, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list. each file in a & digikam; album folder that has none of these extensions, edited by & digikam; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">You can reset the default settings again by pressing the Refresh button to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">Some images have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. however, some images have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. if you have one, then you can get better results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar when you use image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or brighter color in the image. these colors are set here. in the image processing this view mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma-Subsampling it is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression option, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality because PNG uses a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast calculator, you can set this value to high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">Use the TIFF file to compress the deflate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no influence on the image quality since the deflate algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the loss-free JPEG 2000 files, you can save lossless. even if you select the lossless setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG. when this paragraph has been written, metadata has not yet been supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digikam, image editing was just a picture viewer for photos. currently, it evolves very quickly to a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog, you can change the settings of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard note is that all green pixels are equal. if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor respond more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels in odd lines, this difference creates a lattice pattern in output. if you use this option, solve this problem with minimal loss of details. this option records the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is to use a fixed color balance, which is based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images will get more details in the top lights in four steps. for other cameras this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the pointed lights, so the parts of your images are burned-in due to the inability of your camera to catch the shutter lights. use the setting cut in white in the settings. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the peak lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels generally do not saturate as fast as green and red. & nbsp; and dcraw try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions of the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question how much colour or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the reconstructing option, you get the option to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the luminance value according to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1. however, this can be done later in the image options of the & digikam; image processing. in order to keep the time for the demosaicing to be small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demo icing algorithm is a digital imaging process to calculate a complete picture of the raw data that come from the color filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color design.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG Interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests it looks as if AHD interpolation (for Adaptive Homogeneity-Directed) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. it creates color artefacts on the edges.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue corrective values here. this is certainly the best method for a color softening correction, because you are performed during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives directions as it should be given again. there is also LCMS and & digikam; information such as the color information from a color space in the other to translate, so that the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when an image is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folder Find here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can store all your profiles.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC profiles you have the possibility & quot; default squot; for your profiles to be deposited. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here, only your pictures color does not color the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model that you use. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, e.g. Canon, that do not contain any color mapping or gamma corrections. currently, dcraw Gamma doesn't correct for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you need to carry out the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft Proof profile that you can emulate as your image would be returned by a device. this is very useful before you print picture because your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very satisfied. this could be manually corrected instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is pretty obvious what color profile is intended for. unfortunately not in the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. of course, this answer is unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile expansion lets you recognize the style for the target: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image editing. by deploying this interface, & digikam can support; many modules written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules you want to use, and these will be loaded by & digikam; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Quick commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">Further information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds is fine. the other check boxes turn the metadata onto or off, which are displayed at the bottom end of the images during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">On the right-hand side there is a knob of automatic detection, which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, switched on and in the image display mode. currently, serial, USB and USB / FireWire bulk storage are supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list. you must specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / Removable, where you mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digicam; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out if & digikam; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera odell and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera's menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this will be shown in the main window's menu. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option "confirmation dialog" for moving pictures in the bellows, you can edit & edit images; when deleting a photo in an album, you can find further details in the deletion of a photo and deletion of an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be tacitly applied by & digikam; apply if you use the option changes in the right sidebar without any queries. otherwise you need to save the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display the welcome screen of & digikam; embed it when starting. this speeds up the starting process of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting Beim Start to search for new photos is forcing & digikam; looking for new or deleted albums / photos. this lengthens the start time of & digikam;. if something was deleted from the base folder, ask & digikam; you know if it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be used in & digikam; used to customize the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected from the toolbar in settings design. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in plain text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam, you will find further information in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& nbsp; includes quick image editing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selecting the item Ads / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digikam. so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules, see the image editing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the file name, current file number, magnification factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently needed features.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image processing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before using file storage or the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">You may need to make a copy of your image before you change it. this can be done with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Restore or Button re-produce image processing button in the toolbar. you then lose any change you have done in the photo since last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any action of image editing can be reversed or restored. the last action can be reversed by selecting or restoring the edit by modifying and restoring from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should make the keyboard shortcuts, Ctrl; -Z for undo and note Ctrl; -switch-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">When you press the & LMB, press a moment longer via the undo or restore button in the toolbar, you get a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be reversed and restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, picture high, down picture or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the view menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To customize a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select magnification factor</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode. you come to the normal view where you can use the Esc key. normally, the toolbar will be displayed. if you don't want this, you can edit it in the editing dialog.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print the image in the File menu and get the default & kde; Print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or whole sets. whole picture front pages can be printed from your selection. you only need to select the pictures using the standard methods and select from the menu album Export Assist. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digikam; main window has a side bar at the right edge, providing important information and actions for the selected images. the same side bar is available without the navigation file, also available in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab allows the sidebar to appear or disappear again.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied into EXIF and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are transformed. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented, use either the user button or just change to the next image, the labels will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the user button, there is a button More. with this you can read further metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this is always carried out if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The evaluation section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The assessment is posted to the IPTC field of urgency. the code follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword-tree and a selection box with the keywords used before in this & digitized session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword is dynamically adapted to the searched keyword, so you can quickly limit the number of options when searching for keyword. this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is a further relief in the input of keywords during a series of pictures. if you typed several keywords, they are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only apply to the highlighted image and not the entire selection, if you want to add a keyword, please read the Keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The page bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. usually, the left side bar is used with their Album, - Datum-, keyword and search views. if in addition one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop tags. assuming you have selected several images in the main view, you can simply drag it out of the right sidebar and place it on the selection. then a dialog appears that will ask you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper case, the main window displays the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter is based on Keine keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. you have been selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword from the right keyword is drawn to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes will take place at any start of the program. it can also be switched off in settings Various.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created, and find that it needs to be one or more, you can easily change this by double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the record searching in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, key word, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify an advanced search on all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the grouping button. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? free space is limited to 1 GB and you won't want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I have mainly adapted it to & digikam; s specific implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanners and that the colours you print or publish on the web from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the subject comes to colour management, everyone wants to know which buttons they need to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing workflows. in addition, you should provide you with sufficient background information about color management. in addition, you should make links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions to make you the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow satisfies all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">They work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see further information below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image issues are e-mail or web where sRGB is de-facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should you use another color space and have to think about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB in comparison to the colours we can really see is presented below. it shows a two-dimensional representation of all the colours we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, please visit Bruce Lindblooms excellent site and click Info and then on information About RGB working spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to callibrate my monitor if I chose to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in the sRGB colour space or not, you must callibrate your monitor since sRGB means that your monitor is callibrated on sRGB. if you work as in the colour space of sRGB, you must either callibrate your monitor to the sRGB, use an appropriate monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore use it before attempting any further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalize, Figure, Automatically adjust and contrast from the Conducting Automatic correction attempt to automatically make the best of your colors. you'll need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the brightness values over the entire image so that the darkest point black and the brightest spot are as bright as possible without changing its colour shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Synchronization: this method adjusts the brightness factor of the color of the selected image so that the histogram of the intensity canal is as flat as possible. it sometimes produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in an image or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic synchronization: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it detects the dark and light border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram field.</seg>
<seg id="393">Enhance contrast: this method improves the contrast and the luminous intensity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a new jib of all values in between. this is only visible in washed pictures and can be a good correction for poor photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is somewhat limited since it is used over a color space with 8-bit per color. if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by copyright by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side, both the original image as well as the preview of the target image can be seen. the preview is dynamically adapted to the tool's settings. if you want to see the original white balance, then click on the sub-window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel below this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">At the top right, a histogram is shown that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well-lit pictures, most pixels are very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment allows you to improve or downgrade the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. this type also automatically sets the temperature and green values.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the color when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will see the combined result in white balance. this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons to save and load exactly this. each adjustment of the white balance you have set allows you to save it in a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The default settings button sets all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the code depth for each color channel of the processed image. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better for high-quality pictures. however, this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color-mapping can be performed by the sub-window for the brightness. a detailed guide for using color profiles allows you to rate the chapter colour management.</seg>
<seg id="408">This tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to save multiple color channels simultaneously. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same error and therefore always need the same correction. in the manual for sound correction you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you will find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digikam; tool colour effects provide you with four color effects, a soldering effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, solar ionization, also called Sabatier, was an effect that was created when using a partially developed pressure of a short flash light and then completed the development of the image. this had the effect that the brighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. this tool allows you to fine tune this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar ionization. at approximately 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. another upliftment eventually creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar effect. the original image is the (1) and it processes the (2). applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simply, it beautifies many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very satisfied colors in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repeats the strength of the neon light. in large images the filter can load the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is not unusual to correct the color contrast and the brightness of the photo. you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview.</seg>
<seg id="418">When you make a photo in poor lighting conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a too big saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of increasing it. any changes you can perform can be seen in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the instrument clay correction is based on the improvement of exposure. even if the dialogue with this tool works very complicated, you only need the area of the slider for the application purpose described here.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected range. below the graph, three slide rules are clicked into and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to operate is to move the controller and watch out how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview will be updated dynamically, using the settings of the image, updated. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be adjusted if the histogram is displayed using a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear histogram is often dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic division is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controllers: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle sounds, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinpettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, middle and light tones. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls that can be used to change the output values as interactive as with the input values. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create a bleached image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set according to the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save and load: with these buttons, the set values in the filesystem can be saved and loaded later. to do this, the Gimp Levels format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values will be adjusted automatically for all shadows, means and sun shades. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the Luminous channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all colour channels in order to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it's no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images taken with a digital camera is usually the linear mode of the most meaningful. for images with large areas of a constant color, the linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case the logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a shortwave to the right, e.g. the bright tones, you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and darker image pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see. if you shift this marker to the area you want to change, a suitable line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve that you have created can be saved in the filesystem and later loaded. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When using this method and the three color pipette buttons, automatically create the curve control points for all channels of shadow, mid- and sun shades. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and Luminous curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all colour channels to display overexposed pixels. if you find overexposed pixels in more than one channel, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it's no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the Luminance channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digikam; image editing is a tool for improving the colour channels or changing the colour shades of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images. you can edit it from the Color channel mixer of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed by comparison with one's own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are shown in the right corner: control for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you enable Luminance, the image will also retain the overall brightness as the channel mixer then is the tool to create great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-and-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a colour leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space. the colour space consists of small noise files that do not appear at the same spot in the colour channel, and their noise pattern in each channel looks different. if that is the case, you can improve your Monochrome conversion in which you will reduce the color space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The storage and loading buttons are used for this purpose. any mixer setting can be saved later and then loaded. the file format used is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all colour channels in order to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it's no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was readjusted. the option Luminance is enabled. the original image is under (1) and the processed picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step because color images can be converted easily on the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford RP 5 Plus, Ilford Pan 5 Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lentil filter. this looks good, with all the scenery pictures and fits particularly well with portraits against the sky.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange-filtered: simulates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange-filtered.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this produces dramatic sky effects and can simulate moonlight scenes at the time of the day. so similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Slonaton: produces warm light and middle tones as it adds a bit of cold in the shadowls. this is very similar to the process of the appearance of a pressure and the redevelopment in a squiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) squiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digikam; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the engraving of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: shifting this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and dimensionality of the texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied in the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2) to see. the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digikam; tool box can be added a decorative frame around a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a beholder in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier to the scattering eye. in picture frame, the module can be started from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: use this parameter to set the desired frame type for your picture. in detail the picture finishes with a colored line, Niepce is surrounded by a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-and-white pictures), bevelled with a nice three-dimensional frame.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the value range for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be greater than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the pictures, especially if you have used the tool After aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into an image at any location. this also works in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply type the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its characteristics as you need it. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Every setting you chose for your text can be changed until you press OK. once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digikam; apply mould template you can place a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu picture template apply in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template, there are no restrictions on size and orientation. however, you need to use the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) for reduction of the file size of the template. if you want to add your template to & digikam, just send an e-mail to the & digikam; mailing list digikam-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you copied the template files. these settings will be scheduled for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the template, a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder. selecting a folder automatically updates the template bar of the template automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the underlying image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button shrinks the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you must shrink the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image lying under the template. take the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then automatically adjust the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional sharpening tool. it is very fast and easy, but produces fine grainy images, especially in dark areas.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blur mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. in fact, it sharpens no bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of three because it really improves sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for customization.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalized images need a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitalisation process has to be combined with only minimal differences to a colour point. this in turn causes sharp edges to be combined into a common color. the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">Images in raw format, on the other hand, have to be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a focus filter while you read the image. if you disable this, you get control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can get useful results by blurring a photo with the sharpening tool. you can use the Conducing Folder menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">But you should handle it carefully, as the results do not work very naturally: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also enhances the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpness of an image refocusing the tool. under refocusing you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques of sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than it to sharpen. use the tool to soften the soft sign with the menu item Correcise plasticisers and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or the amount intensifies the effect. if you make the blur mask too strong, hedges and the impression of grenades will produce close to sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels are affected by the filter on each side of a edge. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, they should best sharpen pictures in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped image that is added to the original. thereby the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference-amount. in this way, areas with a soft change between the sounds are excluded from the sharper and therefore avoid beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp masked filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image the (2). unsharp masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & nbsp; tool refocusing a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted Detox-Filter algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Vienna Filtration. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blur mask.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the gauss's folding. the Gauß's folding has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result also depends on the source pixies that are far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Vienna Inverse of the Gauss's folding is also very strongly influenced by the distant pixels. this causes undesirable results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures the default value should yield 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, eg; 0 the image quality is very bad.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the gauss. use this parameter when your sharpness is wrong. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a nonzero value, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Mat size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the gauss. note, however, that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Load Buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any more focused parameter that you have set will then be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try out all blanks, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise. the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not visible immediately, but later leave unpleasurable artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress pictures, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, non-sharp masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by blurred masking a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the sharpness. for the Vienna filter one can show that it is the optimum linear filter. practical, the result of the FIR-Viennese filter is always at least as good as the unsharpened mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better when processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied to a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the lens lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of sharpness in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator smoothes the blurring of the area that has been darkened in order to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink mist provides a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove undesired artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting Algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different preferences as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available pre-settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to fine tune the filter settings, you can use the Rider smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Details Warning p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to a smooth smoothing over the picture. whereas larger values are mainly smoother than homogenous regions and details are sharp. a value of 0.9 should keep details in such a way that no sharpening is necessary afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="520">Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value close to 1 only smoothes in one direction. if you have a film granulator or CCD noise, a high value is generated with wave-like patterns. JPEG artifacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value matching to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise is present, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbullion effect it needs to be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: specifies how often the algorithm is passed. usually 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle step-wide da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is chosen small, it should also be chosen small. make sure that small angles produce a long runtime. so you should be able to make this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stride length [0,1, 10]: integral stride length in pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never exceed 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation Use: the more quality you receive by selecting this option is only low. it doubles the duration. we therefore recommend it to skip it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and load exactly this. correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small artefacts. the module is applied in a photo that has been made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a peculiar black artifact in the background that caused by a bad film storage during the trip. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digikam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced Settings window can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time that the filter per pixel needs and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller errors corrected.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel spacing the filter looks forward to detect luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be obtained and noise or lubrication occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls edge accuracy for sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, it can not remove all the noise, or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance of the image. we recommend changing either color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend changing either color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas, which are typically stronger, but it also alerts the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Attenuation: controls the adjustment of the phase grid attenuation. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the luminance density. if it is elevated, the edges appear smoother when it is too high.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used for that purpose. all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much simpler than a picture to sharpen. use this tool to soften the soft sign with the menu entry Correcise plasticisers and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The digicam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove gauss's noise, film granulation, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or later digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texture substitution. the texture ratio is performed with a different tool, the image error correction. the restoration algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labors in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a loss-prone compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; artefactequot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed picture. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">"" "the buttons" "" "Save" "" "and" "" "Download" "" "make exactly this. any hiring of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and loaded later." ""</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time by pressing the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can be restored like a photo with uniform noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious movie selection on the faces. the original image is below (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures were applied to an old color photograph taken with a scanner. you can see the scan-artefacts created by scanner illumination and the photo paper. the original image is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digikam; tool Hotpixel allows hotpixel images to be removed with a CCD camera gem, eight. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high-quality raw mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel & quot; and quot; bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark picture subtraction method. there is currently no manual way to select the bad pixel.</seg>
<seg id="556">Load this file into the wizard with the dark image button. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the appropriate dark picture to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel. note that the wizard shows the last dark image and will automatically load it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview help to correct the result within the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. poor pixels are highlighted in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixels on preview and results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixels. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average cut: an average of the neighbor pixels is determined. the resulting color will be assigned to all faulty pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn into the calculation of a bi-linear interface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the faulty pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the faulty pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hotpixel correction on a color photo taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and a long exposure. the original image has been magnified to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digikam; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in the medium and large photo format, can often not equally illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignettier quot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which makes it impossible to hold the camera by hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center-filters, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise unsharper effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">It is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter using the large coating area of today's film and film scanner, using an equivalent transformation on a raw image without this filter. the tool Vignetting correction applies the transformation with a Centerfilter to a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators you can control the Vignetting correction filter and with three more exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the level of light absorption at the point of the largest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, resulting in an optical filter with aperture setting of 1, or randomly a light intensity of 2,.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to re-adjust the exposure of the target image with these options.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer readjusting of the exposure of the target image, leave the values for luminous intensity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digikam; image processing from the Color Gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting correction applied to a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected picture.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digikam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortion can not be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree covers the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third grain has a similar rounded effect, but flattens at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth grades adjusts the distant vertices to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be virtually eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of distortion of the second degree. with negative values, distortion-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the fourth degree. this value affects the edges more strongly than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'Corner' has the reverse sign of the parameter 'General'.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resizes the image size, resulting in a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive the image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Clear: this value adjusts brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog provides a preview of the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are stored and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonn- and cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or scale changes. if you cut a picture anew and then perform a tonne-shaped correction, the effect would be apparent to the groove.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal relief line. move it to an important place, such as the edge of the sea or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the spherical distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting picture will have black corners. you can remove them with the cutting tool in the Transformable Cut out of the image processing or via the Zoom control of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some subjects such as pictures from front, frame and painting is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture are 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera with the hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonical correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate the infra-red feature of the GimpGuru.org web page that is available under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known underground (tm) SFX200 IInfrared-film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can adjust two parameters for film graining and film sensitivity (ISO). enable the option Add film granulation if you want to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO control changes the amount of film granulation and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in conversion. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel it makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos because the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the peak lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digikam; Filter Film Correction is an easy-to-use tool for reproducing film granulation on your pictures. this is known by classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film graining effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street-photographic, grainy view especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO-sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are needed, to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film grading effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digikam; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright-protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digikam; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance as an oil painting. natural pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the upper chooses the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. smoothing controls the smoothing or, viewed from the other side, the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the processor is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and smoothing 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digikam; Filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a cabbage-ze. pictures whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you had chosen to sketch out for you.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pen size and the lower knob adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">"" "the" "" "digikam" "" "; Filter Graur shapes your picture in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyright-protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn." ""</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digikam; Filter Graur is a fast tool to restore your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure, in which color is not the most important thing. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monotonous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filter. a value of 30, equal to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: splits the image into cells and makes it look like it is seen through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the wave blocks 1, the image is distorted with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects any time with the button Stop.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using sharpness effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpened: blurs the image along with star-shaped lines that emanate from a center point. this simulates the sharpness of a zoomable camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial Unsharpening: blurs the image by turning the pixels to a center. this simulates the sharpness of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance sharpness: blurs the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to be back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion blur: blurs the image by horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the sharpness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening Unsharpened: blurs the picture softly in the dark and strongly in the bright tones. this produces photos with a dream and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton Effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or to add a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness: blurs the image by randomly shifting the pixels and thus simulates the sharpness of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent Unsharpening: finds the Farsink in the picture and blurs them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangular cells and then recreates it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Stop.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make rain drops to your picture. this gives it natural to your images a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of droplets. fish eyes changes the optical effect of droplets on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can with the & digikam; image editing an area free of rain drops. use the selection tool to choose the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter drop drops, the area will remain free of rain drops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the rain drops filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture (2) suggests a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can put it in the right direction by mirroring or turning it into the right direction. you can find the tools in the Transformer Rotate or Transformer Mirrors menu.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate an image and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of resolution are reached? how can you reinvent the missing information or guess? the Cimg algorithm that is used here makes a good work. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size change. choose to change size change in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool to size change uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try the tool to blow up.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflated was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in tab New Size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintaining aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise is present, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbullion effect it needs to be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">"" "the" "" "Buttons" "" "and" "" "Store" "" "buttons are used exactly to do this. enlarge each entry for photo can be saved as a text file and then loaded again later." ""</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Beenden.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo bubbles by enlarging a small image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard enlargement.</seg>
<seg id="640">To cut a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together an image. to cut a photo you simply need to create the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle, creating. you will see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by drawing at the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle can be created simply by using the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting, use the button The blanking button of image editing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the Save File or Save File in the File menu to save the newly edited photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog is preserved.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After aspect ratio, you can specify orientation as portrait format or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of height and width is assigned to the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool After aspect ratio crop use a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches, inches or any other physical size. you can see, for example, a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog, you can use the Max. ratio button to cut the area for cutting to the greatest possible depending on the chosen relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">When you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the changed image measurements are stored in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The composition assistance settings allow you to hide help so that you can put together your pictures better. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonious divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third organ, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle into a similar harmonious triangles on the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden mean is a division that relies on different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the blades of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we perceive as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc., where each number is equal to the sum of its two preceding numbers.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides more fluid relief lines when you put together an image. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition guides the viewer's gaze along the lines of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow in this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">One more rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. this rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should give something that the eye is directing to the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles also derive from the golden spiral discussed above. their vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equal triangles. diagonal to these lines can be released a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal flip and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the color button you can set the color of the help lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the lines can be invisible. this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to turn a picture around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">This creates a picture where things are turned around an angle. this creates a picture where things are turned around an angle. you can do this with the & digikam; image editing and the tool free rotation. choose to transform Free Rotation and adjust the destination angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slide are given in degrees. with the preset button you can set the slide back to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is displayed on the right side of the window.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse-pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">Once you have turned a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair this is to use the function Transformieren zucchette from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the automatic cut function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after rotation. however, keep in mind the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed around a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview is then automatically recomputed. on the right side of the dialog, you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right below: indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image is lubricated a little. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments produce a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you've adjusted the perspective you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transformer cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">This is not rotation, the image becomes distorted. in other words, a rectangle turns into a parallelogram. you can start this module through transformation scissors.</seg>
<seg id="679">If you press Preferences, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and a horizontal line are blended. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the scaling, the image is blurred a bit. for a single grading, this effect is usually negligible, but two chords create twice as much interruption and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the coating, the picture has triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transformer cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digikam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, of the way these libraries have been compiled.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF under it.</seg>

<seg id="725">Graphene is a KDE program for viewing and graphviz; -dot; -Graph. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. until now, there was no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs. the programs that include & graphviz are listed according to the program author's opinion & X11; - or & tcltk; programs with just a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kogviewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraphs viewer; is a KDE program for viewing and graphviz; -dot; -graph. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kgraphs; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration into & Posters; and & konqueror; (so that a change in the graph in & posters; recomputes the graph and represents in & kgraphs;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & posters; to open or open the graph in & ktopviewer; in a</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems from about 1000 nodes and a hack to show more than these knot)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further required software: & kgraphic viewer; is a & kde; program which presupposes the & graphviz; tool & dot; for displaying graphs. required in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graph, each in a separate sub-window. at first, if you start & calliviewers, the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot. in this case, the toolbar only open the symbol file and the (empty) list will open all opened files. click the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot; files, the main window looks like in the bottom screen shot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & old; button);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the file is currently being changed by another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph should be reloaded or if you want to ignore the change. & calliviewer; can also remember your decision, so that later it will proceed. if you want to change your decision later, you can set the menu item settings kgraphs; set up..., see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you want to open a graphite file outside an ongoing & kgraph viewer, eg; in the file browser or at the command line, you have the choice of whether you want to open a new & kgraphic viewer; instance, or want to represent the overloaded graphene in a sub-window of the already running instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice in a long time, but you can also change it later with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">When you start the program, you can open all the graphs of your last session. again, you can save your choice both as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how to divide the graph to several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you are using multiple pages, you can choose whether the sections of the graph coming to one page should be adjusted to this page. in doing so, the aspect ratio is ignored. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with one Graph distributed on several pages without headline and with a different font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Renewable Shop page gives the option to specify behavior when a file has been changed to the hard disk, & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically recharge or ignore the changes) or ask the program each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The opening gives the possibility to specify the behavior of & kgraphs; if a graph is opened outside a current session. you can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a sub-window of the already running session) or determine that each time it is asked.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management page gives the possibility to specify the start behavior of & kgraph viewer; you can set a default behavior (open or unzip files from the last session or not) or decide to be asked for each start.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which usually appears on one click in the main window with the & RMBn, opens up further possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose between different & graphviz; layout algorithms. entries as described on the web site of & graphviz are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; algorithm, the standard for directed graphs. it produces hierarchical or layered representations of directed graphs. the algorithm places edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge overlaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for unicited graphene. it produces representations according to the springform model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multi-dimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & fdp; algorithm generates a springboard model for unerized graphs. it uses the Fructman-Reingold heuristics, and includes a multi-gutter for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm orders the node circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Open a dialog in which you can specify a layout command that will then be executed by a shell. the command should display the graph file as parameters, and output the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command, you can type & eg; the & graphviz; algorithms specific options, or also change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of graph (directed or executed) and applies the default algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directed, & neato; for uneried graphs).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is enabled, the overview is displayed if necessary. otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>
<seg id="757">Displays what is the mouse cursor. click on a & GUI; element to get more help on this element (if available).</seg>

<seg id="759">& kgraph viewer; is a & kde; program that uses the & graphviz; tools for display. it requires the following program packages:</seg>
<seg id="760">A special device is not necessary to use & kgraphs; in the Settings menu, you will find further options.</seg>
<seg id="761">The main window of the icon editor is divided into five sections: the main toolbar, the bar for drawing tools, the status bar, the .color palette and the grid in which you draw the symbol.</seg>
<seg id="762">Create a new icon. once the current file has been changed, you'll be asked if you want to save the changes. then a dialog appears in which you can choose if the symbol is to be created by a template, or whether you want to start anew from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="763">Reset the last step. if you do not have a step backwards, this function will be disabled.</seg>

<seg id="771">Choose Transparent pixels, insert a ruler, and insert one color: or a chessboard as a transparency ad. you can also set the size: the cart on small, medium and large as well as color 1: and color 2: choose.</seg>
<seg id="772">Read the KIPI module pictures to read and save new images.</seg>
<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: use the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner that is supported by the Sane project or another source such as video streams. to do this you need to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu item images, a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to fetch the image. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window will appear by replacing the default values ducer to select your image accordingly. view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before using the button Scan the image. the estimated file size will be displayed in the right, lower corner. in the Kooka manual you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure the window is completely displayed, as some settings may not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have pressed the Scan button you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window to set the options of the target image appears. here you can specify the compression and type of the image file. please remember that type BMP does not compress and therefore create very large files. you also need to select the folder & # 160; select or create the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">Screen shots can be created after you have selected in the Import &gt; screen shot menu. a window appears in which you can adjust the various screen photomodes:</seg>
<seg id="780">"" "select" "" "Complete Desktop" "" "to read a single window below the mouse." ""</seg>
<seg id="781">If all its own program windows are selected, the calling program will disappear, so that you can view other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workspace. if you have selected the complete desktop, only the window below the mouse will be read.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shot is to wait before it starts. if you have to switch to other workspaces, you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there.</seg>
<seg id="783">Once the screenshot has been created, the dialog appears with the options described above.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. with Flickr it is possible to send your photos to people that are important to you. you can show your favorite photos of the world, put the photos of your camera mobile online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family around the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The Flickr module can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time, you will be guided through the process of generating a token. so it is used for your authentication. so it's your ID to Flickr. a browser will be launched to allow you to login to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After successful registration, the module can send photos to the Flickr website. the following page will be presented after a successful login.</seg>
<seg id="800">Just close the browser window and return to the program. after you have pressed Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module exporting to Flickr is launched for the second time, you will be welcomed with the following dialog, which displays the current access permissions that the module displays. the module now does not support other permissions. you'll be asked if you want to proceed with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button photos should be pressed once you have set all other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. when you press the Ok button, upload the photos to Flickr Server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The tag field can be filled with a comma-separated list of words. these are added to the picture as keywords during upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">The Public, Friends and Famillie options allow you to adjust the access permissions to your images. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you change the option change the size of the photos before uploading, the photos before uploading are changed in size. size is taken from the value registered at Maximal size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI module Gallery Export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server.</seg>
<seg id="808">The KIPI module Gallery Export now has no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data is stored in the EXIF-keywords of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization provides tools to localize images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, longitude and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data, you need a GPS track as an XML file in gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsd you can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization Korrelator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. the above-looking dialog appears. to get a possible correlation of time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file loads, an automatic correlation is performed that shows the coordinates in red. GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and so the camera time must be converted to GMT. this can be done using the time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera distance. if the deviation below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have track data from a location for pictures you can edit the gpx file manually and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">Interpoling and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have matching data. if you know that in reality there is a location in a big time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the correlate button to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place. since the dialog will remember the coordinates of one call to the next you just have to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and placed with the displayed map. choose the region and enlarge it. guide this over and over again until you reach a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the map can be changed between map mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are ways to attach the GPS data to the images. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to ensure the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML. you just need to select these albums. the three buttons on the right hand side you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below you will see the Albenpreview and the text that appears in the head of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider's appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self explanatory. if you click on a picture, a new page will be opened in which the picture will be displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default picture viewer, & eg; Kuickshow</seg>
<seg id="825">The Rider Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all of your associated images. choose a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder with the name KIPIHTMLExport which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth, you can change the default color depth, which of course also influences file size. all other settings are self explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The tab preview images allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumbnails, these are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window displays the user how far the action is. click Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. therefore, you can read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during production. the web browser will automatically be started to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool for viewing images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform on them basic operations such as rotations, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and folders. it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is shown as default in full screen mode. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossfree module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below, without the usual loss of quality and metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of loss-free storage is that the file size increases as no compression of the color information is taking place. this can be found, for example, at the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool for you to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client has no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module Metadata Editor does not currently have any documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the mailing list kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere but not write into each target format. JPEG is supported while writing. please check out exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodiver module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodiver module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the packets Mjpegtools and ImageMagick. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are scaled automatically to the correct size for the chosen video format. additionally, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG Diashau. then you can start to create the module via Extras MPEG Diashau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then listed among image files in the Portfolio. there you can also change the pictures or the content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are happy with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning to play the file on a TV, you need to select the corresponding TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value creates a very sudden, high contrast, very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should leave them black. you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file. keep the extension prompt as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it is integrated into the movie. after you have adjusted all settings to your wishes, you can start coding the production of the movie with the button encoding. depending on the speed of your computer you can quickly or quietly enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide show when you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a hint appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the Mjpegtools and ImageMagick packages above the button settings in the lower right corner.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g. useful to improve or print directly with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: do not expect from dcraw that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcrap!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to convert and start the module. the Raw image converter window then appears in the mode for a single image. with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines if the camera settings are to be used for white balance. the main parameters like Gamma, Brightness and Red / Blue Amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to enable you to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the file name stays the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged image format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to edit your pictures frequently or later use them otherwise, you should not choose the JPEG format as it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a memory format, the metadata contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the EXIF information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the executing button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at a time. therefore, use this mode when you are safe, e.g. by testing in a single image which is the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to overwrite existing file automatically. this is helpful if it was created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick Package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the start number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick Package. you can make the image smaller or enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): resizing in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option, for example, to adjust your picture to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print Preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be used before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the picture window is displayed with the selected pictures. you can add more images using the button Add images. for the last selected image, a preview will be shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag the images onto the picture list and place them there to add the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">"" "with the" "" "Remove" "" "button, the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent." ""</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images you can open the new message window of your e-mail client using the OK button. you only have to add the addresses and the subject here. the pictures selected by you are already attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Don't forget to send too many pictures at once. most e-mail accounts have limitations for the size of e-mails to be sent. it may be a good idea to send multiple emails when you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending images. your configuration is saved and used every time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in an attached file, the comments will be added to the images in a text file and added to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the File Formats menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted among the lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG in images file format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original copy data will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be automatically closed to view the status messages, in search of errors. your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end. with the button closure you can close this window.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the Advanced Diashau module, a window will appear with questions like you want to display your slide show. you can choose between the selected and all images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL option in the presentation uses very elegant visual transitions using OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphic card, as otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The filename option displays the filename of the images in the lower left corner of the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">"" "the" "" "loop" "" "option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an infinite loop. you can then manually disconnect with Esc." ""</seg>
<seg id="889">The possibility to select pictures randomly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not used the order of the images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The distance between the images can be set between the images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select. randomly, each transition from the images chooses a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">On the lower left side of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date has no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool for setting a picture as background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module uses the currently selected image, depending on the selected submenu option, as background for your KDE working surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes, you can use & kphotoalbum; Browse these, see the picture. as you can see through a comparison with the image, are now available in each group, i.e. in people, places and in the group keywords.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you can see the categories for which you typed information as you have provided your pictures and videos with notes. additionally there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course look at the current preview images.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you hit the characters with the mouse, the browser view changes. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the images displayed on which both persons can be seen. through this selection method, you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the people, locations and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images of your area of activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can save with & kphotoalbum; however, for each person a separate thumbnail, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself. see the picture below.</seg>
<seg id="904">In order to display images next to the names, select the button located right outside on the toolbar. in the appearing context menu you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can display symbols with pictures of individuals and at the same time a list of keywords (if you do not have suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must decide for yourself which image should be displayed for each individual person. to do this, you need to open the image view window (described in more detail) and displayed in the context menu of the category Editor. here you can select the image for the respective person. in the view window, you can adjust the magnification factor according to your wishes and by selecting which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you call the search in the main window, a dialog will show you that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog once more.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the label or description, the descriptions or descriptions of the images will be searched after this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can either be part of the total date, e.g. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can browse all the images according to specific names as you can see in the picture. here, according to pictures, on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user's manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you don't like reading manuals, but rather want to try some functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and take a look at the quick entry, the screenshots and the introduction videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and in the first dialog, select the demo if you start & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu entry for the first time, or select the menu entry for the first time, and you can download the functions of & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you can find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum, see the timeline. you can see a picture of this bar here:. as the name suggests, this bar shows you date statistics on the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can show you several different time units. each bar then shows another unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image will show you the current date in the preview panel) and in addition, the timeline displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of the timeline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, so the time data. if you select an area, you will only see images of this time frame in the preview pane. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides two ways to create HTML websites with your images. the one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other is available as module (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & kphotoalbum is described; built-in version that you can create through the menu File...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages are created you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas of content, layout and target. in the following, each section is described more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the overview and a description that the HTML file should contain later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages, you can see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select if you want to create a & kphotoalbum; export file to be viewed on the overview page.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information is displayed to the viewer without description. for example, that all images are from a party. note that all pictures are from a party.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can set how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why this is not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">On the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. this means that those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, do not download any images that, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewers of your page can change the resolution at any time you have specified. so, you can browse your images with low resolution, leading to a lower transfer time. if you want to get a picture larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">The best way to select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored. this folder is saved and automatically added to the location next time. this allows you to set the location for all future images. here you can select either a folder or a KDE-supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if they are all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser will start after the pages are created. the URL you set here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are still not in the final destination folder, you have to manually copy them to it. so the import function, see, properly works you need to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The just described settings have all three based on base folders and URLs. a subfolder is created in these, whose name will be specified in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum, you might want to share your pictures with these. however, if you have already spent a lot of time viewing the picture information, people on the pictures, location, etc., then you must with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum, you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are exported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in the fact that the images themselves are stored in the file or whether there is only one link to images in the file. the advantage of all images in the file is that you have all the images together and can share this file as independent. however, the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file directly from the File Export... or along with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images two times. first, it searches the images that are in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding pictures are not found, then the images of the URL you have entered when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML-Export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting pictures is described, which you can access via the Export menu...</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the option Manuell to copy to the .kim file, you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">Copy & paste the images automatically to the .kim file with the option Automatically in the vicinity of the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most of the images were already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files. if you want to do so, simply select the Export File option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the pictures in full size because the .kim file would otherwise be very big. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File Imported... select, will import & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for importing consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folders the importing images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category people of the file to be imported (if you are a domain), while this category is in your database. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialog box to import which categories of the file to be imported and which categories it matches in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can offset the categories of the file to be imported using the categories of your current database.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view images: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump inside of different picture groups & mdash; if you want to see pictures of your Italy vacation and discover an image with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will pass the various steps of (1) Determining information about your images, through (2) the browsing and viewing, through to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">PhotoAlbum has started as a program to manage your pictures, but it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos too. in many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but often this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the index.xml file in the top folder of your images. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, to a floppy or revisions in the CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; records the folder in which your images are stored and used this in future starts automatically. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum, then you can start & kphotoalbum; with option -c. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / Company / Images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Through the menu entry Preferences colphotoalbum; setup... go to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual, you will explain the different settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the left you see six different symbols, with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting a detailed help is available, which can be accessed by pressing a button on the F1 key and clicking on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">This describes how you can set different properties for each image, for example persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">View the dialog used to edit existing groups. for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the dialog options you can set up complete groups of members, i.e., for example, all members of a group at one time in a group instead of explaining all groups of a link like in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares its modular system with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">Modules can and will not be described in this manual, since they are not part of & kphotoalbum; they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can call via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used together with one another, it may be that modules with & kphotoalbum have been tested very little. therefore, you should always test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own pictures. demo database can be accessed either through the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu. don't tell me, I wouldn't have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules use via KIPI are very different, making it possible that some modules with & kphotoalbum do not work. this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other applications can arrange their images in albums: an album is simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum, this kind of order does not support, it simulates the order for some modules to use the functions with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which is simply the current view, so all the pictures that show you the picture preview at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, a list of albums has to be handed over to the modules. here goes & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s Browser shows the contents of a category, for example all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category people, it will be & kphotoalbum; so do so if you would have selected people to view and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog and select modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen when you start & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are accustomed to from any other KDE application, you will see a menu and toolbar at the top. under the toolbar, you will see the window with which you can browse your image database. at the moment, we will find no information about your pictures yet. in the section we will look back on this window, now click on the entry pictures showing you an overview with all existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to provide any picture with notes. this includes information about the persons who are shown on the picture where the picture was taken. you can set any picture either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if for example, shown on all pictures Jesper and all pictures taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these annotations when using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">You can see three lists with a text box by assigning people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; since you can always use them again whenever you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on shifting the images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and are shown on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons, you can, by moving the names used upwards, find people faster and arrange them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the sorting button on the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected comments for each image individually, you may want to edit all selected pictures and add annotations. in this case, simply click on the above and back buttons, which are under the preview of the picture to the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have received multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to select all these images and use the menu item Several entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the US. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">The picture shows a browser window that shows the USA as a supergroup. to show you that it is a supergroup, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the annotation dialog, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory. in addition, you can simply drag an entry to a category and place it there to make this entry into a subcategory of this entry. note that you just sort your categories in alphabetical order.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the single elements of the annotation dialog by clicking and moving the bars that form the top edge of the frame. you can also make your own window from a frame by drawing it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the appearance of the window so adjusted to your needs, click on the options... that offers you the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely fade out a frame. if you want to see this window later, use the button Options... and click here to fade out. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the image in the browser, you will get an overview of thumbnails of the currently selected pictures, or of all images in case you do not set filters. you can configure the size of thumbnails, by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button. try it again.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this picture will be set as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this is displayed in the image viewer. if you don't have a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Delete in the Edit menu. now the window will show you that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use with & kphotoalbum; for example, images can be used without you having saved to the hard disk. of course you must have saved the pictures somewhere so that & kphotoalbum can be recorded in the database index. in the picture you can see the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all needed pictures can be loaded from the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images, in which the right upper corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard drive. however, for the images 5-9 the thumbnails are present so that & kphotoalbum can show you the preview of these images. however, you can not view these images with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this feature requires you to copy and copy files from the folders and copy it back. if you want to avoid hassle-ing-ying of your images, please buy a larger hard drive to store all the images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the Pictures menu, you can find a submenu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that at the end of those you want to make accessible to others and click on Current View in the Privacy menu. alternatively, you can also control all the pictures that your little sister can see, control and block the menu item Anything out of the current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this you have set out which images should be hidden in the case of the case. if you want to give the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry images, so all the images you have locked can be hidden. if you want to get the pictures displayed again, click Lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered for unlocking the images. to set up this password, simply choose password change in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please keep in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, all images on the hard disk and on the other hand can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection only serves to deny the view to private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you spend all of your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to consider them sometime. for this reason, & kphotoalbum has a picture _ and video viewer. you can start this from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you. of course he shows the picture, but additional all the information you have to enter through the picture, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the info box on top of the picture you want to see, you can easily drag it with the mouse and put it elsewhere. you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed at all. all these options are available right click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">If you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you load multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the button image high and down. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide show. & kphotoalbum; then loads a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the viewer of & kphotoalbum; is it possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you can use the viewer, you can move in the image and zoom out. for zooming, you can simply pull up a rectangle with the mouse. the plus key zooms in the middle of the picture. shows how a zoom-rectangle is selected and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">"" "with the" "" "button" "" "button you can zoom back your zoom, so that the image will not be zoomed. with the tie-key, zoom the zoom, so that each pixel is on the screen of a pixel of the image." ""</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zooming operations that work with videos are in and out with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the revolving functions from the context menu, you can rotate the image. this does not work for videos. you can add comments to the current image with the menu item Remarks from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. at the moment you can view that and open configuration dialog of the image to enter these names.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you see one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to provide images with features while viewing them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter. in view, you can see a picture in which the characteristics A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your images, they are available to you in the browser. so if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever you have selected, just tag all at once with notes. this is described in. after that, you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in preview view. if you can view categories in dre preview view, then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case you will allow you & kphotoalbum to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not stored with the image, but stored in the database. in this way you can reverse your common later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to view the painting mode of & kphotoalbum, select on the image from the context menu. to end the painting, just press the cross in the toolbar top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you need to use the application of the program & Povray; not fully control, but the documentation to & Povray; should you absolutely have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is represented in the wire model views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time, but not the sub-object of an already selected object, since all sub-objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click either on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the menu Insert.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop down menu will be displayed to enable you to choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">By deleting either from the menu bar, or from the right-click context menu, you can remove previously selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to Apply these changes. if you entered invalid values, a message with an error description will be displayed. then you can rectify the input errors and click Apply again or discard the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to & Povray; user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; Reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can view a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press Preview in the Properties view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render a sub-arranged element (for example, a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), cross local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the camera's control points. you can drag the control points with the mouse button, thereby changing the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse inside the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility level as a wire model. you can indicate this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher-level object or as an absolute value. objects are displayed only when they are selected or their Visibility level is smaller or equal to the stage of view of the scene chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window order or if you need a different arrangement, you can set them as desired. you can also store multiple window orders and switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window over or below a view, drag the Anfasser to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the user to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other, drag the Anfasser in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the flashcards at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. in order to resolve a view from anchoring, drag the Anfasser to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the chamfer bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view click on the small cross in the bevelled bar. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views to the main window. in the View menu you can find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any place.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with view window layout... Save. it displays a dialog in which you can save the window order under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene you can render them renders. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g to render, this program has to be properly installed. when this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the Rendering symbol Rendering the icon rendering in the toolbar or select scene renders.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and the quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many Render modes, from a quick preview to full pictures of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or select Render modes in the View menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but useful is a name that lets you know the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the cross section subsection and enter the image section for rendering into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination with quality, you can select the properties, the & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuser reflection lighting. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel, various errors can arise. these images often have a Moirè pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not shown when they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you switch off anti-aliasing, calculates and combines & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as a standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling the neighboring pixels with inclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixel exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are individually followed and tested for further subdivisions. the maximum depth of recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another possibility to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you switch on ittering, changes & Povray; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; that calculates diffuse light reflection. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the associated beams have not hit an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly ended, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray, select the Import menu entry... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not the complete command range of & Povray;. if error messages or warnings occur while importing, a dialog box displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source code of the object to the open text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source text in the editor and drag it to the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can paste source text for & Povray; also include.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">When you click on Help in the property view, opens & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; User Documentation to the displayed object. here, make the path to your document and the version. supports versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example, height field data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the scene folder, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the view field in the camera view and in the window type features.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time to render. for some objects such as the ball, you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high details for extended projections, all wire-model views are further divided when the camera uses advanced projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of the perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives better approximation for projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is represented in a chessboard pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you tick the ground, a bottom is rendered below the objects. the bottom is represented in a chessboard pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick box smoothing, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the window arrangements section, you will explain how to create and save window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">Drop down selector standard window arrangement: displays all existing window arrangements. & kpovmodeler; used the selected window arrangement when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders. a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and deleting a selected arrangement with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name shows all views for the chosen window arrangement. new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the button remove.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column, you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with Unten anchor the window under the existing window, with tab card you get a flashcard view together with the previous view and hovering the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more accurate knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a sphere on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied to rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert light sources, your entire scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed all error-free, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following preconfigured window order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the Edit menu item. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you create. in particular, you see this in the fourth wire model view (right bottom). this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the content of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the User Documentation to & Povray; you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera is in the view control points with which you can change the destination point of the camera. simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you click the Apply button or push the input button, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. for example, you could insert a header (insert infinite bodies) and size on x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides a simpler way. you can use an infinite plane as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or the input paste. in the object tree, the new name is displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire-model view now also shows the level, although at the moment only as a finite level. if you render the scene, the level expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree, you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor when clicking on the symbol + before the object. in this case you will only see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the bottom to the exercise one unit below the horizontal line, only to get to know some of these parameters. choose shift and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens where you can select how the object should be inserted. please select first sub-object. the pigment is then displayed in the object tree. you can change the name in the property view (Name = bottom pigments), with a click on the button preview see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the pigment preview only shows a matt black material, because you still need to enter settings for the pigment. keep in mind that you can check the look of materials at any time with one click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you do not see any color on the loader and ball, click on the Apply button and then enter the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, these are not the colors you expected. in the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. then edit this entry twice (you can do this even more frequently, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select the color in the object tree each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should already be done, as you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; you should have already understood it. the ball can be created just as easy as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget the input button or the Apply button), so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground as you have shifted the bottom to one unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering now results in a strange result: as before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. put a suitable material in the next step.</seg>
<seg id="1105">Once you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already on the ground, give the ball a pigment as a colour:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select first sub-object and change the name for example in sphere Pigment. click on the Pigment ball, then select Incolor and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following screenshots and click Apply or press the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you & kpovmodeler offers; hopefully you've learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracing a scene the renderer shoots hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) by each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this beam is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog will impact.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see nothing without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a source of light, you don't see anything, the picture is just black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file that you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be stored in the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and storage space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. any changes since the last saved release are discarded.</seg>

<seg id="1121">Store the current window layout and open a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the shortcut and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Open a dialog to change the keyboard shortcuts. you can set default short commands for & kpovmodeler with this option; change commands or add new commands.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set the toolbars. you can add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodeler with this option.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model any diffraction on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a dump-map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are created from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then further machined to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by applying an image file as a color card.</seg>

<seg id="1182">You may set up existing multimedia buttons to function as & Amarok; short commands work. this will make your keyboard to & Amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions that are mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlist browser and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports Qt and & kde command-line options; Amarok additionally has some own command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependency. please check in your script if all needed modules are available and use kdialog, so that the user know why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Korundum' rescue LoadError error = 'corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings V3.4 is required for this script.' kdialog --sorry '# {error}' exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder, you will find a lot of template-scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply extend them to the required functions. you'll quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command; any KDE installation should be included.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow executing external programs and commands. in this way, the exec () function is used. in this way dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here's an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this reason strings are written to the default input of the script. for this reason scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore events even if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure The script to display the setup dialog. in order to save and load the setup data each script must take care of itself. when a script is started, Amarok will set the folder to the folder where all data should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange shows that a new piece is picked up. the script could now & zb; with DCOP functions, you may request further information about the new piece (for example, the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newVolume signalizes a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths Contains the path to the selected files of the playlist when a user-defined menu item is clicked. to remove the menu you can use the DCOP function dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; it ends, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the SIGTERM signal to the script. this signal should be processed to do, for example, saving data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2).</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the selection of amaroscript. for this reason, you should rename your script packages correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main critic has to be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to obtain the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can upload it to www.kde-apps.org and link to the Wiki script page of & Amarok; append. for your entry on kde-apps you should use the Category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful functions and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist, instead of having to work through endless menus. maybe you just search for a very specific title of thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's collection Browser and quick search you will find this piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Maybe you already have some playlists, but can never decide which you want to hear? then the playlist browser is the right thing for you. and if the decision is still difficult, select the dynamic mode and the smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. besides, many different audio systems can be used so YOU can choose how to listen to your music. Amarok is intelligent, sexy and chic - just the right thing to experience your music anew!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually, in the basic folder of the Amarok sources, you have to enter the following to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Da & Amarok; autoconf and automake are used, you shouldn't have any trouble while compiling. if you encounter problems, please report them to the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok; like most applications, has some options that can be activated or deactivated at compile time with the configure script. this is a list of options available.</seg>

<seg id="1216">Save playlists when saving, automatically save the current playlist when running & Amarok; Enable this option if you don't want to lose the running playlist while you exit.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually stored playlists: if you enable this setting, & Amarok; relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, use. otherwise, the absolute position of the music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Keep up-to-date pieces visible when changing the play, that the playlist window is up / down to keep the current piece always in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">Switching to context-browser automatically shows the context browser as soon as the next piece is piped.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section you can adjust & Amarok; s Appearance. the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the font section you can set the use of different fonts in & Amarok; set by marking of Own fonts, the otherwise gray shown section is enabled. you can select fonts for the following area: playlist window, player window and context browser. click select..., so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With the selection of custom color scheme, you have the choice of choice and you can set your own color scheme. use the color selector shown below for foreground and background color.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Reproduction at startup causes & Amarok; after the program start, resume play automatically with the piece at the place with which it was stopped at the last stop.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Set up the On-Screen display allows you to switch on the OSD. if on-screen display is displayed, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click select... to select the font for the OSD from the dialog. the shadow shadow causes the text to be displayed in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Using your own colors gives you the ability to adjust the OSD colors for lettering and background. clicking on the color spaces opens the dialog for color selector. if your own colors are not enabled, the pre-set & kde colors will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The display text input field displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering wildcards the OSD can be adapted to your needs. below you will find a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for Xinama users, so you can specify on which screen of a multi-monitor environment the OSD should appear.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The audio card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop-down field. some drivers still activate further adjustments in this card card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection. this includes the folders and the type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder, which & Amarok; to search for music files. in order to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also contains check boxes to set how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Browse the subfolder as recursively: this causes & Amarok to search for music both the crossed and their subfolders.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitoring changes: allows & Amarok; to monitor the selected folder to changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). in addition, an incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Importing playlists: causes & Amarok to add all found playlists to your collection folder (.pl- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists will then appear in the playlist browser later.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The part collection database is used to select a database for the collection. combination box Drivers: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further configuration is needed in the sub-window MySql setup.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql device section is used to set the database for & Amarok; on Calculator: will enter the machine on which the MySql database is located. then under port: the network port under which the database is available. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use username: and password: to enter the data needed to connect to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The card load .fm supports the support for last.fm. & Amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Here you enter your username and password for your Last.fm profile. if you do not have a profile, you can register one on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Send playable pieces and update the profile: this setting allows & Amarok to transmit the names of played pieces to your last.fm profile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">Retrieve similar interprets: after activating this setting, & Amarok will retrieve a list of similar interpreters to the one played. note: you do not need a last.fm profile to use this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (such as & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the package kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you have to have kdelibs installed so (including the programs included in it, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide how to compile kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some features such as the OSD require that your window manager will adhere to the relevant standards of freedescaltop.org, so Gnome will work, but fluxbox will help, for example, trouble. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt, because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file by using ~ / .kde / share / apps / amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the Taglib developer under bugs.kde.org and also hang the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most of the time it is because Taglib crashes when reading the meta-info from this file. please report this error to the Taglib developer under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database then try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of the libraries used by & Amarok were compiled with the same compiler version. if e.g. & Amarok; compiled with GCC 3.4, Taglib but with GCC 3.3.X then this leads to crashes when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then disable automatic turn off when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or use at least no value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens if you crash). if this is a common crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be resolved.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into the meta-info, but do not mark it as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "The file $argv [0] does not exist" unless -f $argv [0]; my $v2tag = $MP3- &gt; get _ v2tag; print "Error in writing the tags from $argv [0]\" unless $MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarokapp: icon lookup error: amarokapp: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixmapERK7QPixmap, then check if Amarok uses the correct Qt library. this can be seen with ldd 'which amarokapp' _ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you may need to remove any colliding Qt or / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok will find the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are some ways. most installation problems are the easiest way to solve your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or developers. use the forum and IRC under irc.freenode.net in the # Amarok channel.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugfix is not suitable for searching for help. please only make a mistake there if you have something to fix a bug in Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok; only an empty playlist appears. how do music pieces come inside?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is easy. use the file browser on the left side and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In order to keep the surface intuitive, the startup sub-window was converted to the statistics window. you will find it under Extras statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars stand for the evaluation by the user, while the points are calculated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To evaluate pieces, the rating column must be displayed in the playlist. click the title bar of the playlist and select column show rating. click anywhere in the new evaluation column to set the rating for a piece. you can also use the shortcuts Windows + [1-5]. this also works when Amarok is in the background.</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device must provide a blender. a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio. this can be achieved by a sound card using hardware mixers (e.g. SBlive) or through the dmix module for alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you in finding the cause of the problem and a solution. for GStreamer, you may need to specify another sink (e.g. sink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">Do not forget that media must be decode first. you can't just send a MP3 to ALSA, you would only hear a white noise. gamers are the best choice for most people if you're looking for a decoder with little overhead. GStreamer reads the file, decodes them and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS will also decode the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open sound servers with highest possible priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (see next point of the FAQ!). make sure that artswrappers suid is set:</seg>
<seg id="1277">With KDE 3.2.x there are problems with KDEMultimedia codecs that can cause disturbed play. read this bug report. enlarging the sound buffer in your ALSA setup file .asoundrc can also help.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Either you do not use the Arts driver but instead GStreamer or xine, or install KDE multimedia to get the faster arts codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Probably use the Arts driver. use another driver (the xine driver has been strongly optimized for analyzer), or decrease the size of the arts buffer in the control center and sound & multimedia, sound system.</seg>
<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but if I want to switch to the GStreamer driver, crashes & Amarok. why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After installing GStreamer, you will need to register all the components. if you register, register to register all GStreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't help, you can also ask at IRC Channel # GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (exit Amarok before!): - download ffmpeg, compile and install it. then, run folder registers, once as system administrator and once as your normal user. then delete all the ffmpeg files in the module folder of GStreamer (you will find the module folder with you-config / GStreamer-config) and run the login register again. start now & Amarok;.</seg>

<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok are used, including creating a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one-click & Amarok; control center. at the top of the window is a running text display showing the current play time, bit rate and sample rate of the current play. one click on this area changes the display of the already expired game time to the remaining play time of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window includes a selection of audio analyzers, including the running text display. you can switch through the available analyzer by right-clicking on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press on your keyboard and the current analyzer will be displayed in an independent, magnified window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Under the running text display, the PL and EQ buttons are also displayed. the PL knob activates or deactivates the playlist window, while the EQ button is used to set Equalizer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the play position slider. use the slider to set the play position or volume. play the playback / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 pre-settings from Classic to Techno, and you can easily create own presets.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To display the equalizer, use Tools Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you mark the check box Equalizer, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist of & Amarok; is the most advanced playlist of all for & kde; available multimedia player. it has many features that are not available in any other player. but don't let the fullness of functions deter you, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">In the navigation area you can find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser. in the navigation area you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context-browser displays various information regarding the current piece. its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs. the context-browser contains three sub-windows: music, Text and Interpret. these three sub-windows are later added to the details. they provide information on the current piece to different aspects.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok, you may notice that the sub-window has dropped off. the information shown there has now been distributed to other parts of & Amarok; in addition, information can be collected in the statistics window (Extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the interpreters and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this sub-window displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, performer and the album. below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to emulate the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Under the MusicBrainz symbol you will find more information about the current piece. you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the context browser will also display cover images that were either downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the Recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this artist. this area shows the five highest scores of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information you want to display in the music subwindow. just right-click somewhere in the sub-window and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the performer, lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will fold up and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all the pieces in the single areas to immediately start playing. you can also right-click on it and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">This feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites with the help of self-written scripts. once you click on the text subwindow, try & Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if not yet a text script is running, you can choose which to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the song text. the modified version is then saved in & Amarok; s collection database, and no running text script is required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button opens a search on google.com according to the lyrics for the current piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - groups only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">This is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list among various performers.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Artist / Year - Album - Sorts to interprets and then after the year of the album in descending order (the latest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default is 0 - album name.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are displayed alphabetically by each other. the performer is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping genre / interpreter - your pieces will be sorted by genre first and then by interprete.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Interpret / Album - This setting works just as the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the performer.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can adjust and combine grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically record your collection once you change something to the selected folders. if you own many pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">Directly below the toolbar is a search filter. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. instructions for using this filter can be found in the section for the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Below the search filter is a selection field with which help you can filter out the last added pieces to your collection. there are several time windows available, starting from the last 24 hours up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="1368">Clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection Browser gives you the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This will insert the current playlist and add the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play.</seg>

<seg id="1373">Transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces to the queues for transferring to the media player. for more details see the section about the Media Player Browser.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this performer / burn on CD - This means that the selected pieces are sent to K3b and burned either as a data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option will not appear.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Open the dialog for piece information and let the tags change for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Move files into the trash... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">As a compilation highlight - Select the selected album as a compilation, whereupon it appears under various interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Set up Markup - Changes as a compilation of marked albums back into a normal album. after that, the album will no longer be shown under different interpreters, but again under the associated interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlist browser makes it easy to handle many playlists. among other things, it also includes smart playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. they use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with pieces in your collection that has never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created smart playlists are possible. click on Intelligent Playlist to open the dialog for creating a new smart playlist, where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Media Player subwindow is used for the connection of & Amarok; using your portable media player (e.g. iPod). to be able to use your iPod with & Amarok; in / mnt / ipod. if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod by interpreter sort in the top list view of the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list interpreter. if you are done, click Apply. this will add the pieces to your iPod. when the transfer is completed, quit & Amarok; and resolve the drive binding for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">The tool bar is a search field with which you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser is a address bar with which you can fetch music from a entered URL. if you enter for example tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz, you can access music in the musik.tar.gz file. now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the attachment of files can be tricky by simply dropping down the Shift key. in this case, the holding of the Shift key can be helpful: this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply pulling the entries with the mouse to the desired position. once you enter the characters, only the pieces that contain the characters will be displayed. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter separate search terms by spaces, & Amarok; search for entries that contain all search terms. if you enter e.g. one two three, the search will find all the entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">For example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces that contain one or two or three are found (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you would like to search for entries that contain spaces, close the search term with Gänsefüzes: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries that Mike Oldfield contain, but not for entries like Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific search column, you can search even bigger or smaller. for example: evaluation: &gt; 50. This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, put a minus sign in front of the search term: -something is looking for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants at will. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bathroom. this search for all pieces that either include Mike Oldfield, or a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bad.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of entries by pressing the Ctrl key, and then right-click in the desired order on the entries. the entries will then receive a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some features of the playlist. on the left, you will find the Add button you can add to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, undo and restore the buttons. this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1410">If you want to add a piece to the queue, select the piece in the playlist and then click +. you can also simply add the pieces using the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1411">There are three types of dynamic playlists, two of which are already presented (details to set up these sequences later).</seg>

<seg id="1478">The content view allows selecting and dragging files into the project view. the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive is selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The head strip is a narrow area, which is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the head strip does not have any real function, it looks only pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the view.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog window to change the keystrokes for & k3b;. after you have selected one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the key mapping for it below.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This will start the k3b; setup wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions to burn CDs and DVDs. therefore, system administrator rights are required, so you need to enter the password for the system administrator at the start of the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Open the settings of & k3b; here general application settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should work immediately. this dialog is intended for personalisation and fine adjustment of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also equipped with a & DCOP interface. using this interface, parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script for example.</seg>
<seg id="1484">In order to use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the command line program dcop, or the somewhat more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and the type of your task is crucial in the matter which of the accompanying programs you give preference.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume you can use the command line dcop. to use the & DCOP functions, you must make sure & k3b; started. then enter something like the following in the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that all & kde; program have in common, supported & k3b; mainly two other parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface from & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, formatted DVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createDataCDProject () DCOPRef createDataDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () DCOPRef createDataDVDProject () DCOPRef createDataDVDProject () DCOPRef createDataDVDProject () void formatDvd () void formatDvd () void formatDvd () void formatDvd () void RavensnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXproject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project through using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectForum.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b provides the K3bProjectForum listed above and the powerful K3bDataProjectForum which is only applicable to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name, QString parent) void addUrl (KURL url, QString parent) void addUrl (QString path, QString Name) void removeItem (QString path, QString NewName) void offset VolumeID</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders and then add files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT create</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kogcreator; is an audio CD; reader for & kde; it can easily be read audio CD; s can be read and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kogcreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in wav files on hard disk) and by many encoders that coding these WAV files (These encoder packages still have to be installed from the Linux distribution). more encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the titles of the & CD are read and stored in wav files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these wav files (usually one per title) are compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or in other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudio creator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, it must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggogbis (for OGG) or other encoders have to be installed. all these programs are usually available for any Linux distributions, so it's probably not necessary to install something yourself. however, if FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodizer gives a small introduction about encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as I said before, cdparanoia for reading the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to crack any copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device fails, it is not possible to use a protected audio CD; even do not handle the mechanisms of copy protection. simply avoid buying duplicated audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While the setup has to be done only once (the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found), then the daily use to read a & CD will be explained afterwards. this leads (hopefully) to understand the lean approach of the user interface, which you will often stumble across at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which encoders are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>

<seg id="1510">Open the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as minutes, Piepsen) for program events (such as reading & CD; exits).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog by & kaudio creator; with various flashcards (such as encoder, to set the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoder and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. apart from FLAC, there are also others such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are low compression rates and hardly any commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustical model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may today have an easy advantage over mp3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate the differences are less important as both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O 'not so' free, lame is nevertheless provided with most distributions for free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high audio quality (with high bitrates), but compared with OGG slightly deeper quality in lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG solvents is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special auto-stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly support only MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset Medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has already quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is manually entered or fetched through the program from the freedb via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. they can be passed / used with & kaudio creator; and the encoding program to create folder and file names as well as the properties of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the aid to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; add titles to the keywords (English: tag) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt from lame and the title parameters of & kaudio creator must be added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudio creator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database in which people can read the audio CDs that can download information instead of entering the machine. it must be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, Artist, Name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of the translator) bin not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; any information publicly available on the & CD; no more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed. all information can be obtained anyway during a stroll through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudio creator; is actively selecting a check box (sending an address). for using freedb can be used with another (counterfeit) address than the one in the system. in this kind of configuration, it appears, the e-mail address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (This can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if you are using freedb, the closest mirror server is to be used geographically. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the computers.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online pick-up of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from the & CD; in wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more precisely, search in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package from the appropriate distribution needs to be installed first if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read wav files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. at first opening, pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) are on the tab for setting the encoder. other encoders can be added to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed by the relevant Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the predefined encoders.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; Console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many reasons. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, writing and reading real, and if both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc.) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy protected audio CD; check out the cover of the & CD; this will not work!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is one chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, you can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keyword (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">Cdparanoia and lame must already be installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can, for example, be found using a search engine as it is considered as not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission (eg; by trying to copy something into it).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section treats the basic setup of & kaudio creator; something that will probably only be done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what should be repeated for each read & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoder to be used for compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change it at any time you read a & CD; change once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program to read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, you can also view the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The map map of General Settings. here you can't do much. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything will be left as shown as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only select in case of incomplete information, so that you will be informed when information on creating keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and leave the & CD; data automatically downloadable via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is easier, becomes a & CD; entry found, immediately starts reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / file names or tag entries, they can be easily changed. the directory or file name is changed with Konqueror &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">You can work with freedb locally in offline mode if you download the database before. however, this is more than 620 MB, think twice as to whether this is worthwhile. to freedb in offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the freedb section.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to page freedb.org and look for a mirror server near you. on this way, the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function equivalent to the server, since many firewalls are bucking the protocol 8880 as standard, there may be more luck with the protocol 80 since the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we don't want a & CD; transfer data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously missing pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know it, so just try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Discard CD; after reading the last piece: cross this to the & CD; discard at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you do this, then / must be specified the path / folder in which the WAV files are stored. this can be useful if there is only room on another disk. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. don't forget to do this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All the same as it is on the screenshot. the command is a little long, under certain circumstances, something needs to be smoothed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned before, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the generation of tags on version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if required. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tag for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of encoded wav files at the same time: with a Dualcore or Quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tempted to encode more than a WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is it, we have just finished the basic setup of & kaudio creator; this configuration is used as default for each reading a & CD; use. if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wise, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section is described how the process of reading the & CD; runs on the hard disk. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, was created in the previous section. first, a connection to the internet is established, because we are comfortable and want to fetch data from the freedb. the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each read & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet contained in freedb, the screenshots look a little different from that for a & CD; with successfully fetched data. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data manually inserted, rather than picking them out of the Internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try the & CD; find this example. it's a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not yet been done, now the & CD must be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen then look in the Questions and Answers section for help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the CD has been successfully picked up by the freedb, all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; there is a window appearing, and you can select the database entry that fits your opinion best to your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not select the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also manually trigger this by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but get the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD Editor - input the CD data and title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field 'Current Title' unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini-vidually per piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words start with uppercase letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we only use ID3v1 tags. this restricts the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment field. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudio creator; maximum allowed. this option is set on the encoding settings tab.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders and file formats. see how to use the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Just choose an entry that obviously matches with the style of the suffiding CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the & CD; data anyway. for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The CD editor window appears again and you can see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data, which we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed the same way until you have entered all title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear when you download the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album will be shown above the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece. only the title selected is read out. a simple click on the line switches off the selection of the piece. make sure all pieces are selected, or select the All items at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">If by clicking on the button selection read out the selection process, this window will appear to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab Orders to switch to the order window. it is located in the top half of the window, right below the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to check the jobs. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message can be seen if you are trying to work with a encoder that you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example. did you check if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: job 4 is the encoding of part 1 into the format MP3. this takes out retrieval and coding in parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing configurable seems to be the number of parallel processes for reading and coding. in high-performance machines the result is unclear. the used computer with an AMD64 does not seem to have a problem at simultaneous reading and coding (of however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last song is read out while another piece is coded and a third order is placed in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is coded, a small window with a message will appear in the top left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kCD;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">If you are familiar with CVS, you can download from there an anonymous copy. most distributions contain however already a pre-compiled package, as & kogcreator; part of an important & kde; package is. if you read this, you probably already have done it...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is intended for people who compile source files, and not for users who use a precompiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help, how the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running, then the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs, has many variants of settings. it is best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it displays screenshots of the various map cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still reading? even if only the Help menu was clicked after the first start of the program, without any clue as it should go on from this empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of the program start), or from an unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it all about? who reads this, probably already started the program. it should look something like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no email. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is intended as the first version for a manual to & kogcreator; but if you want to add or change something useful, let's do it. at least after the contact with the author. and if you read this, he has left this section and agrees with this proposal.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange if you managed to get the source file from the & kde; run SVN, then you do not need these informations, but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and karaoke game by & kde; besides others, he also has some features with real-time graphics and karaoke real-time highlighting of texts also some features that other & UNIX; -MIDI players don't have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS and & kde; support also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver, which is required for GUS maps. ALSA is included as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color, making it easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag and drop so you can drag in & kde; any MIDI file from a & konqueror; window to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files (song events or text events). kmid automatically detects the procedure used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. when you finish & kde; quit playing a song, kmid will start with the same song next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select... from the menu file. it appears the usual file dialogue, with which help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; window into the & kmid; window. this works also with several songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the button Play in the toolbar, select the item from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts once you drag it to the & kmid; window. (in several pieces you will be added to a collection and then played afterwards.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid, play a play, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and go back and forth with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click the arrows on the left and right of the TempoDisplay and so change the speed of playback. to restore the original tempo, double-click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu, then interrupts playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics and other both. some pieces do not have a text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined using a song, so that you do not have to manually set anything manually. so, if you want to change the automatic text selection entry in the Settings menu, the Karaoke text will be automatically selected.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an event type, select the entries from the Settings menu. the same function also has the buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you summarize. these are played in sequence. in this section you will find how to use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you can find it in the collection under the item Organize... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then giving the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the desired item in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs that you don't want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not stored. remember this if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the Add button. it appears again the file dialogue, with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting automatic adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece will be automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">When automatical add to the collection is not checked, when opening a piece, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied. this collection will then be added to the continued pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the sequence from the menu sequence of the menu collections, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it from the collection manager, or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the Next Song button, add the next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To reverse a song, select the previous piece button, add previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter, since it is not stored when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers that are not general MIDI. in this case, the MIDI-Map General MIDI events translate into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of Change patch to Bright Piano into events of the Change patch to Trumpet type, and thus always makes a trumpet sound if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you don't need a MIDI map because all sound cards GM are compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM equipment and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI maps, so you have to edit the corresponding file manually (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all the required replacements for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, the requirement for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">""... "Define PATCHMAP... END Define keymap" "" "Another keymap..." ""... "END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END" ""</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as email so I can in future versions of & kmid; offer support for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, you will see how the Patches of General MIDI can be mapped to your specific keyboard. general use is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional All KeysTo M is used to set the tone with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a gun signal (GM patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with Ton 60), which sounds similar to a rifle.</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 (gun shot), it takes Patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that this is the term Trommel-Patch of the patch, where every sound represents a different percussionment instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not the one where the sound is the pitch of the always same drum (as some keyboards have).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to indicate how sounds are displayed on a specific channel or instrument. use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple Keywords for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keyboards are mainly used to map tones to the percussions channel. see, for example, the included keyboard maps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and the second channel, simply do it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI to Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 rows, numbered from 0 to 15, according to the following sample:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel which is shown on the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap must be defined further forward in the file. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events that attempt to change the patch on this channel will be ignored. in this case, patch x is always used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">"" "the" "" "Forcepatch" "" "option can be useful, for example, to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel." ""</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which ratio Pitch benchmarks are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch benchmarking event with the value n, this value is converted with the n * (r / 4096) and then relayed. the value 4096 is used to prevent decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM pretends that a keyboard which receives a pitch Bender event with the value of 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboard players try to play two sounds up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the dialog MIDI Settings. this can be found in the Settings menu, Point MIDI Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole number of keyboard sounds (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to display the played tones. in the Settings menu, select Settings under the Point Channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The tempo LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the bigger the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">So if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music needs to be played. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc. thus, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you get a similar sound quality.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; this happens because & kmid; compiled without AWE support. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree to support & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all files, and drag it to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">First, activate the setting Automatically add to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the standard tempo, you can double-click the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & kde; desktop a & konqueror; window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or stop (if I want to play a karaoke file), just change to the & konqueror; window and drag the file to the window of & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file only once, without adding them to a collection, switch off automatic addition to the collection, and the new one; file will be added to the temporary collection. opening files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mi. and C.Thermid. First you just want to play the first file. so set the setting Automatically add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mide and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, I encourage me to continue programming.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Laga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; Laga. I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; Laga. I have programming, MIDI files collect, make music and prove phrases.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you just want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">If you send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all that send me a postcard or MIDI file, I will list (if you want to). before sending a MIDI file, you should contact me since I might have the file already.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I've written & kmid; written entirely in my spare time and won't get any money from anyone. I would like to stress that I'm more programmers only because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AWE cards was too high.</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer as the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it's not the same whether you use an FM radio or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you must have & kmid; compile with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you have a sound card except that you can of course not hear music.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that only appears when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred links under the Bookmark menu, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category permanent playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy of hierarchy. when you click on an entry, your group and all its sub-groups will be copied to the current category, and playback will start with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' up-to-date pieces', television and permanent playlists can also be changed by direct editing the XML configuration files. of course you can only do that if & KMPlayer; not running. the various files in the ~ / .kde / share / KMPlayer / folders directory can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to select playlists from the menu menu and select either the edit mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without matching the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer, some functions can only be enabled by modifying the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation of starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modify [General Options] No intro = 0 above option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be inserted easily.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to enable a different animation. & KMPlayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation does not need to be short, it is automatically ended by opening another source. this would be annoying at the end animation, so the user can finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos: & lt; jg; jg; & lt; jg; / / / home / Koos / mum.gif "fit =" meet "/ lt; / smileys; In the source package of & KMPlayer, are listed in the list of tests / some examples of SMIL that are supported by & KMPlayer.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; here you can set the path to the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for debugging is the button 'Console' in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer visible.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this device in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; everything needs to be configured by manually editing the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc file, just like setting the backend per mimetype. here's an example like a flash with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & KMPlayer; you can even insert the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">For the & KMPlayer; 'flash' can play in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer must be specified as service provider for the Mime-type application / x-shockwave flash in the setup dialog file Configuration of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or SMB player; can be started in a console application and searched for error messages regarding loading the browser module library. if there are no errors here, the backend output is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">So that a given backend for a certain mime type is taken (of course only if this has been determined), it must be done by manually changing the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc file. for example, phonon should reproduce all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be viewed, the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured. for this, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog in the settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo port should be used. there should be detected ports from which one is selected. the encoding must be found (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb included in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since VDR can only use XVideo support for KMPlayer, XVideo should also work (probably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux expansion needs to be functional for the X server. therefore, the XFree86 server must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, various names are used by SMB for the sources. at the time of the creation of this documentation, dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, introsource, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vd source. when enabled, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">There are hints how to quieter my CDROM drive when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom can be run as user root after connecting the device. it is absolutely necessary to make sure that / dev / cdrom is on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts only slowly, why does my CPU have to be checked for their performance every time?</seg>

<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; file search can be very helpful. once a DVI; file [device-independent file]] was created, jumps & kicks; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; viewer to the corresponding line in the & latex; -Source text.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the editary output from & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools for view, conversion and printing of DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">The elements of the DVI; file with the editor are plucked with the editor and once clicked on an element in the DVI; file, the corresponding section in the & latex; the source code is the exact opposite. once clicked on a section in the & latex; the source code is clicked to the corresponding place in the DVI; viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document the work with other involved .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set over project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick release: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result will be displayed automatically (if there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">"" "surveillance: in this mode, the DVI; file is" "" "weeding" "" "on a" "" "weeding" "" "and there is no appeal of & eyepiece; after the quick installation." ""</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit tool bar, the three large selection fields should be noticed. the selection fields have been developed for quick insertion of common elements into the document. the first drop down box is for quick integration of the document into parts, chapters, sections... The available & latex; instructions for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The Other is available for entry of items such as tags, notes, notes or references. the available options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: this command creates a name for a section, a picture or a different element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a specified term (selecting a select field).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a drop-down list with literary entries is displayed. at & bibtex; this only works if the file belongs to a project. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & Kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down field with the name GrÃ ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for the definition of the fonts. the fonts can be set for the main text, the key notes etc., the following fonts are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile, two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The parentheses after the command\\ 'class contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] specifies the fonts. if the font is not specified at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above code example has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use the menu of building or the push of a button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved prior to compiling. & Kile; runs the storage automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Failure to compile the document should be searched for errors in logging. if it is used for quick installation & eyepiece it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be followed.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the written letter 12 will be created and only a few columns should have another font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} will then facilitate the change of lettering within the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are only cleared within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no restriction (number) for the changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the legibility and user-friendliness of the document. it can be added, for example, certain fonts, fat pressure, cursive pressure, submissions, etc. these commands either end with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the cursive expression and is otherwise closed until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or any other environment. a single word in a set can be represented italic with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. quote begins with\\ begin {quote} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background has been shown to write the source code with the & latex; markup language is now followed by a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard, a few adjustments for the better legibility of the document should be executed. to do this, make a quotation, a few places in the fat and curative pressure and a poem to be used to see the differences between these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, editor-View or Ctrl E can return to the editor again (for internal viewer). with an external viewer, the window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI file has been created, the document can be printed or converted into a PostScript; / PDF file. just try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (D e V ice I nº). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file the same steps as for the creation of the document are necessary (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed by file print (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; file has been created from the & latex; source code, the conversion can begin with the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The pre-selection search allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position inside the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; offers a corresponding setting for all & latex; -Binding files. to do this, only Modern can be set up under Settings Kile... Tools Buildings will be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to check the pre-selection procedure, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a line of the source code and then clicked on pre-search. the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI; viewer is then effected.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; -Document by & Kile; open and jump to the appropriate line. to do this, & Kile; in & eyepiece; defined as a text editor (settings eyepiece setup... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If an error occurs while using the & DVI file, there may be an error. if there is an error, this will be shown in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file explains the source of error in the source code. in the editor you can use the Previous LaTeX errors and other LaTeX errors for sprints between the bugs. the log file always indicates the line in which the error appears. in order to view the faulty line, the error in the logging must be clicked and & Kile; jumps to the wrong line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">When you click on the relevant button in the toolbar, a window to select the template to be used will appear for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting an empty document, a document can either be rewritten or used for quick creation of a new document. further information can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Frequent users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for nearly all documents. templates can be created, saved and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file will be open or created a new file. & Kile; can create a new template by using an existing document and choose File template from document... Create.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using File New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in settings box... preferences are set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is necessary to know which strings are to be replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is substituted by typing in document class. typically, it will be used as follows:\\ Movie class [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$].</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created this way, the following steps have to be executed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can then be selected instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files created. if a simple way to create a template is desired, you should search for one on the Internet and follow the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & Posters; as internal editor. & Posters; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and protruding of many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;).</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & Posters; and its possibilities, the manual should be consulted with Kate. users of & Kile; can begin directly with reading the chapter Working with the Editor of & Posters.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference, which can be called via the LaTeX reference manual. it contains a detailed description of almost all commands in & latex; you can find use as well as its syntax.</seg>

<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift, parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to browse the various types of source texts and highlight these. for example, the & latex; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are distinguished by a different color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can add additional jump marks. this is an own kind of bookmarks within the text. the menÃ ¼ ls edit jump-brands or the appropriate keystrokes result in the jump to the next or last jump mark.</seg>

<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located before or inside the command\\ begin {environment}, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested ambient commands, the overview can be lost quickly. this command will include the last modified environment, so that the nested ambient structure will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups specified by parenthesis {...}. in the Edit TeX group are some important commands that match those from the Edit area.</seg>

<seg id="1909">If the inspection dialog does not appear, select Debugging Inspection... from the menu. to edit the sources, click the Source Text tab in the appearing dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1910">All found templates are listed here. it must be noted that the export rules of & XSLT are valid. therefore, several templates can be present with the same agreement and mode details.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Clicking on a template in the shown list moves the text pointer in the main window to the corresponding line of this file.</seg>
<seg id="1912">Local and global variable are shown on a card in the Xsldbg-Inspector Dialogue. the following example shows XSLT code in which a global and a local variable is declared.</seg>
<seg id="1913">By clicking on a variable from the list, you get a summary information in the dialog below. if a variable is a particular expression, for example</seg>

<seg id="1915">When clicking on a list entry in the list, the text pointer is placed in the main window to the corresponding line of this file.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The version 3.2 of & quantaplus; contains many new & XML; tools and functions. these tools are unique in their integration in & quantaplus; all these tools use Commander as surface and libxml2 and libxslt as base. the combination yields fast, efficient, complete and productive tools.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Everyone who worked with the & kde; documentation, knows me and how outstanding it is. do we raise it one piece, we give him a graphical interface! no more on a terminal; simply clicked on the icon for the XML processor and done!</seg>
<seg id="1918">This application is expected to be index.docbook in the folder. if index.docbook is in a common folder, then leave the current folder. if not, then remove the selection of current folder and enter the folder in the field of other folders.</seg>
<seg id="1919">Output files are stored in the same folder as the source files. all previous & HTML files will be deleted every time meinproc is started.</seg>
<seg id="1920">As I said before, everyone who has worked at the & kde; documentation has already worked, knows how helpful this application is. and with & quantaplus, there is now a great graphical interface for that.</seg>
<seg id="1921">If the newly opened file is index.docbook then simply select the current job folder. if not, then select current folder and enter the folder where index.docbook can be found.</seg>
<seg id="1922">If it comes to an output on the screen, its file is defective. please check the reported errors and try again.</seg>
<seg id="1923">If the file to be checked is already marked in & quantaplus, then let the current file simply be checked. if not, delete the file at the current file and select the file to be reviewed by other file - file selection.</seg>
<seg id="1924">If you only want to know if the well-formed file is, click the well-formed check selection.</seg>
<seg id="1925">For using a & DTD; which is specified in the & XML; file, select & DTD; (Internal) (default), otherwise & DTD; (External) and enter the location of the & DTD; with Definitions URI; file selection.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Yes, & quantaplus; also has a & XSL; processing tool! this uses the xsltproc tool from the libxml2 library.</seg>
<seg id="1927">If the file to be processed is in & quantaplus, already selected, then let the current file simply be selected. if not, remove the selected file and select the file to be processed by the other file file selection.</seg>
<seg id="1928">Specify the name of the file as the result is to be named. the file is usually stored in your home folder.</seg>
<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, the & quantaplus; ladet, have with & quantaplus; even possibly little to do. this makes the plug-in system very powerful. you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone uses the desired in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plug-in or a cPart, we start editing the Edit menu. this will open the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows to manage all contained plug-ins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plugins without a location, & quantaplus, this path to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often working on a project involves several individuals in a kind of hierarchical relationship. & quantaplus; supports the indication of team members and they can be configured with Shift; F7 project project properties -dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email are self-explanatory. nickname is the nickname of the user and is used for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as Team Leader and Subproject Manager.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this happens by searching the team member out of the list and pressing the Setze button. the currently selected member (their identifier) appears in bold after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of your own identity are important in regards to news and comments. see for more information on notes.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to the overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team: it can be created an event for information to the team leaders when something is happening. see for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something is happening in the project. an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project so that later it can be seen how much someone was working on or sending a message when a file is saved, or a script that plays a file to the CVS once it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the Event Configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Project Settings dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email is sent to the address data selected in the recipient list. the addressee can be a team or sub-project manager.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Remarks are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Notes to enter is simple. it can either be selected from the editor context menu or the @ annotation keyword is entered in a comment field followed by annotation text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes can be sent to a certain member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), where nickname is the nickname of the team member, role play a role in the project from the following possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are independent of upper or lower case letters, but spaces around the brackets and the: make the note invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantaplus; is a development environment for scripting and formatting languages that is DTD agnostic and supports web-based formatting and scripting languages.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings can be reached via the Settings menu. here, only about & quantaplus; -specific settings are treated, a short description for the other can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up by settings Quanta... called. this dialog extends over a few pages that are treated one after another.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behaviour of & quantaplus; regarding tags including code completion can be changed with it. entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Tags: large / lowercase of tags: large / lowercase of automatically inserted tags. normal / lowercase means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lowercase of attributes: large / lowercase of automatically inserted attributes. normal / lowercase means the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically close: if checked, for tags, for which the closing tag is optional, it will be inserted immediately after the tag.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Non-optional tags automatically include: as above for all other tags except for simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Start and finish date automatically update: if enabled, the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic setting of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accentuated characters into the corresponding coding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for the detection of different types of files. using the default button, the default values can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening open files (where the encoding of the file can be bypassed). however, this setting is executed by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the chosen DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD has not been detected. however, this setting is displayed by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates regular backup copies so that during a power failure or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in your own view (or documentation in a tabloid), which makes it possible to view the documentation, preview and source code at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Set the window settings to the default back at the next start is useful when the user interface has come through changing the MDI modes and other / depending on views. it corresponds to the --resetLayout command line parameters.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning messages area is used to control the display of warnings by hook of no more.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change the behavior of & VPL; to change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronizing behavior of the PLA and the source text view in shared mode.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, representing the figure of the parser node in the document, can be set in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the area of structural tree settings, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the upliftness of the tree during processing and how deep in a change of the structure tree should be opened automatically. empty knots are the empty areas in the text, while empty groups are those where no element was found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area for setting abbreviations (a type of templates), which will unfold when editing to more extensive text. abbreviations are in groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP; this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the ifant abbreviation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here the plug-ins can be managed. plug-ins are KPart-applications from third page, which can be re-used by any cPart-capable application, the most known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin, if it is not located in a standard like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is given to the plug-in when starting, so it can open the current file, folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load the component in the "Read Only" mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load. only-Lese-KParts normally deny the loading if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is enabled, then test & quantaplus, if the information entered is correct, even if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, troubleshooting was completely new developed. support for the no more necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger has been set, as well as support for the DBG Debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implementations to plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plugin is available that adds support for the use of & gul; inquantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the Debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plugin in the Project Properties. with the button Settings next to the Debugger plug-in drop-down selector, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view where the content of monitored variables is displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all locking points, with line numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is shown. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported features of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger if required, or it tells the plug-in to listen to debug requirements. this action is triggered by default, when a project is opened that uses a debugger, so that normally it does not have to be paid attention to.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debugging session starts the session. includes the connection to the debugger or terminates the listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the Debugger output view.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start running the script and send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens, while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. if the script is started, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start execution of the script without informing information about controlled variables and the current line number. if this happens, while a script is stopped, the execution continues. if it happens before a debug is given, the execution starts as soon as a request is set.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger introduces the next command in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger introduces the next instruction in the script, where possible, if possible, in functions and include incorrectly.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to pass the instruction and go to the next, as if there were not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Open a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered that is to be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog, a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work by Keith Isdale and this part of documentation. & kxsl; is a & kde; front end and a part of xsldbg, that they can find on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many other works of Keith.</seg>
<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you can adjust & quantaplus; adapt to your needs and like you & quantaplus; help you become better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type Editing Packets (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; they enable & quantaplus; capabilities like code completion and node trees. their simplicity and flexibility make of & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s exist in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages and / CSS; & DTEP; s consist of two parts, the tag folder and the toolbar. tag files contain two file types, the Tag folder and the toolbar. tag files are handy, symbolic columns of image buttons (above the editing pane), which insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or created automatically from an existing DTD. see in for details on conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create tag XML files, then file descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML Files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the Featuresdialoges, the & quantaplus; for the day. the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow for quick inserting tags into a document without the risk of a writer.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they contain only the file descriptionrc; and the tag XML files. tag files carry the name of the description language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declare whether they are necessary or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information in working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. all about the possibilities and limitations are explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a tag XML document. it can only appear once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing else but only element type over itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when used & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (only Family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for class class. the name of the base class for this class. (only Family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (only Family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attribute group and attributes within that tag can be added to any other day. (only Family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text into the dialog. this text is defined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tag. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it defines the name and type of the attribute. in addition, there are other tags describing how to display this attribute & etc; This is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code for the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an interface and method name. the arguments passed to the method. can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that assembles the elements of a list. it can only appear once for an attribute description. it is a single element element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">This tag should be available for each field in the dialog once (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a tag. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces influence nothing, but pay attention to & & lt; characters. they should be replaced by & lt;, especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will not cause shredding, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the tool is dialog at the top of the & quantaplus; window to start and check TagXML. to select. another dialog will appear whose simple instructions will follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, the check is only in loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following, an example for a family 1 day XML file. this file describes the & lt; scheme &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the file name for this tag XML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following, an example for a working family 2 day XML file. in this file a & PHP; Overload function is described. the filename of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt;! Doctype tags &gt; & lt; tag &gt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "function" returnType = "string" status = "optionally" / &gt; & lt; / day &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it, achievable via DTD editing DTD settings. this can be edited by diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; a simple & descriptionrc should be created with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = turn 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name will be used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with settings actions... created. click New action to create the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The keyboard shortcut assigned to this action. by clicking the user button, a key shortcut can be assigned; with Keine the current keystrokes can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be inserted a text in the detailed settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document in the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action you can start external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document), started. examples from & quantaplus; even the Quick Start dialog or the various See in... actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. This way, & quantaplus tries to locate the script in the following places: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in its path: $PATH There is other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replace with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with PID of the current & quantaplus; process replaced. if by & quantaplus, only one instance is running, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; from the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can input & quantaplus; in the selection field you can specify what is to be sent to the default input. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, directed to the standard output. it can be specified what should be done with the text written on the standard output, by setting the value in the output selection box:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to subdivide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create an own toolbar for each group. in the given case, it is not too many, therefore you can create a toolbar with the name of the Markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Preferences actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Complete all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the day has attributes and you plan their use, enable dialog "Edit Tag" if available, so that an input when using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol, that the action is better represented, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & KMenu;, Graphics, other programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the tag start, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually interpreted as loose, fixed, further interpreted), or should at least signalize a message to the user that clicking this symbol will include a & lt; start the day in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it must still be connected to the action. this is done via the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, if there are any, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; add functions to the toolbar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview. open the toolbar set dialog on settings toolbars. make sure the desired tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">After selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the item to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how disconnect the grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar might believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by tasting all symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">After new eXML does not exist, it is created in root folders, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust your file descriptionrc; so that its toolbar (s) will be loaded (s) when a file is opened by the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation to the script language or the formatting language you like most. that's why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository if someone has done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to search for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc. then you must create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation html files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index of Section1.html Section1.html Section1.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.3 [... [Context]</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can see now in the & PHP; documentation such as:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Basic syntax,...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the box depth (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You realize that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; file is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing, but pay attention to & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; Resourcendings will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file, which is used to create context-sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; scripts to display the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. by marking the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your docrc file and go to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / Wondershare / doc for local and global use. then create a folder (as you have specified in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation to it.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation were used to the & quantaplus; -Repository for use by the & quantaplus; community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the failing resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or anyone else. in different places there is an e-mail menu entry, such as the DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive from where all others & quantaplus; users they can download. the contributions will be checked and made available only if our team uses them as correct and usefull for publication. to make an updated contribution, the source of resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for your private GPG key (the passphrase is not stored), or in the event you have multiple keys, you can choose one. in the dialog New resource enter the input fields (URL preview can remain empty) and start uploading with OK the upload.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), upload tool bar toolbar, and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examined & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing. in case of problems it warns and it can then be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by & quantaplus; however, the creation may be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be required in everyday XML format. there is the easier way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD File and Converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which is to be used. then the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype definition line: the string that appears in the! Doctype Tag, such as HTML PUBLIC / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: when enabled, brings & quantaplus; after conversion the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand them and to be able to draw full benefits from & quantaplus, one must first introduce themselves to these fundamental concepts.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & Quantaplus, the working area is divided into three sections: global, local and project related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for each, the & quantaplus; use, available. from tool bars over actions, everything that is marked global is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the administrators to secure various toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only be used in person.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most limited size. all elements are emitted in the folder tree of the project, which emit the joint use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of a number of main areas: the editor window, the construction views, the flashcards with information and the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can use the right mouse button to select a context menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other, or all of the tabs, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or run of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the editor area leads to another contextual menu with regard to the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cutting / pasting / pasting), editing the tags located under the mouse cursor, or opening the file, if the string is called a file under the mouse-cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor window, the toolbars of the editor are located. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which a set of toolbars is displayed. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, e.g. & lt; insert into your document, then click on the symbol that represents the tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in different fields in a dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The Baumantas (QIT;) enable you to navigate to & quantaplus; to navigate, open them and roam. in the presentation with file grids stand for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus. this view displays all files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right mouse click. actions such as add, remove, upload or delete the files from the storage media can be performed with the displayed contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus. global templates are always available, local templates only available for the appropriate users and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information to a script. by right-clicking, you can access the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is set in the document to the position of the element. by right-clicking an element, a list of commands opens in relation to the navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other tree views. it can easily change attributes and namespaces with it. the application-oriented entry system allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation of the web technique for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'Documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be appended, edited and viewed project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default & quantaplus; two tabs at the bottom of the window where useful information can be reached: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab shows information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the Markup of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Die & quantaplus; toolbars are extensive expanded and easy to understand. show them to a symbol and they will display the appropriate command. the tool bar of the toolbars is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed Tar archive via & kmail;. if you get a tool bar in an email, you can save it in & quantaplus; like any other store and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of & quantaplus. for that, autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that is not an older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH ahead of its bin folder. the same is true for & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML editor, developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus? well, this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now widely on the way to a generic and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML, then & quantaplus should be the appropriate & IDE.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim, it must be noted that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; development community is based. & quantaplus; follows, in good use of free software, the idea of Why develop what already someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; scaffolding is not only possible, but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can increase productivity dramatically. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost every task possible.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly developed to a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More details in the details refer to help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or execute helpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not located, the oldest record is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use. check the section on Templates. should they attempt to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">When inserting from clipboard there special characters are converted to & HTML, so they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts text from clipboard to & URL; spelling which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily used for inserting & URL; s into the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">This allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift; button.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; -Script err error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a type grep or sed with GUI and predefined phrases to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Extension and switching of the problem reporter at the lower edge of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set Bookmarks with a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with entries previous or next, depending on the cursors position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped by the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Open an existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog to insert files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows you to copy video files to your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Load the files in your project on the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings such as & quantaplus; the project manages. in chapter & quantaplus; projects you will find the details explained.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Load a project toolbar. these are kept in project you / toolbars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Open a dialog to add a new toolbar. this creates only the name. actions must be set by means of settings... to be added. toolbars are stored by toolbar toolbars or you are asked if you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. you don't delete it from your hard drive. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you'll be asked if you want to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team, so that the toolbar is present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows uploading of toolbars to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load one & DTD; that you or anyone else has made and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Reload / refresh entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP are to be refreshed without renewing all & DTEP; if this is global and a write permission in the global KDE folder is not present, the store fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbars. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a sub-menu item in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags Tag, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">This only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantaplus; the inserting by tool bar is denied if this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plugins menu, the available plug-ins are listed below the above menu items. click on them. click on an activated plug-in deactivates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemata depends on the posters; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Choose the type of line identifier. very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the current document's syntax based on the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching can sometimes take time or create unnice graphics. recommended is the flashcard mode, which is also the default setting, or the sub-window mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open sub-window. selecting an entry will activate the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Displays the status bar display at the lower edge of the & quantaplus; main window.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affect any application using the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Directs the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & Posters, you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar, or which you can add and change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help in accordance with the mouse-pointer's environment, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus, development in financial form, they find the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should ideally be filled from top to bottom, as e.g. after filling the project name the entire directory structure will be automatically completed for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can later be set with Shift; F7 project project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here's the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file is filled in automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can specify the server address of the machine you want to access, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.ad.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used. depending on the remote host's setting, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and default templates. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows you to insert files from the local filesystem into the project. you can select multiple files or whole folders.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. in case of server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">If files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included. if a project is started from scratch, not hooks.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders will be displayed inside the main folder and you can select an exact choice of manure.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This displays a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hook or, by removing the tick, clips from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the subwindow profile or with the key shortcut Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the Project Assistant and are described in detail. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (wildcards possible), which are re-read in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Added option to top, also files listed in .cvsignor are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the desired debugger to be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the debugger plugin can be set with the button Settings. in the troubleshooting section is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the Profiles section, high-profile sections (see in) can be set up, as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by applying its own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration, event actions can be switched on and these actions can be added, modified or deleted. event actions are executed when a pre-determined event occurs, such as securing a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus opens; the last project that was opened.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select project open... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webslij as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is automatically saved. you'll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project manager gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folder behaves as well, but the entries open and open with... with the right mouse button on the right-click context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows to remove the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button will be blended to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in memory and forgotten during programs. this option is useful if frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather unsafe password on the disk storage option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & Quantaplus, many high load profiles can be created to upload the project (or parts of the project) to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server's name on which the files should be copied. either a full-qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should select from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not have to be changed, except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it cannot be read easily, but anyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in a project, i.e., through simple exchange of view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted in the Project or Project toolbar, accessible via the tool bar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this not only helps increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to its own working method.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above, tool bars are in & quantaplus; best handled by the toolbar menu. use and add differs. the addition of tool bars is handled at the bottom of the addition of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the symbols on it can be set either using context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which with new action, a new toolbar can be created, other actions such as toolbars can be removed, toolbars should be rename, or tool bars should be executed, which can be specified in the dialog where the actions on this or other toolbars should be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, additionally the entries action will be removed and action edited, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the actions on them can set up toolbars in the menu... and set up actions.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are basically document skeletons, code snips, and files to link. & quantaplus; uses templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any existing directory in the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the limitations one imagines for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template prior to use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually inserted in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples are found in the template tree under global templates. more information on the template tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text document type. based on these templates, new documents can be created. typically, more specific documents can be created in appropriate subfolders. you make a simple scaffolding for the purpose and organize the work in a proper way to be efficient. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area. you can find everything from a comment to a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates are used for entire sites as templates. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently, there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and choose File As template save as local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has been done, note that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look in the template tree below project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As template save choice as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be easily dragged with dragging and dragging onto the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: copy the file only to a template folder. it can be used for all file management functions, such as drag and drop or paste over the Konqueror file tree.</seg>
<seg id="2207">In the file tree or in the project file, you can click a folder on the right and create site template, enter a name for the template and back up. by default, it is backed up in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very goal-oriented approach. you can set headlines and footers or dynamically create with & PHP; design, insert files or link them with them. in addition, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / .kde / share / apps / quanta / templates. each folder corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder, click the right mouse button to click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection field with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is blinded as soon as elterous attributes are inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits everything except the root folders in the template overview. if a root folder is set, it would basically disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text brick. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows predefined or copied text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines or footers for all templates for a specific project and allows to fill a whole presentation with the appropriate headlines / footers by copying contents templates to a folder with special headlines / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (show right mouse button) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and pasting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source text editor, which can be accessed through the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and turn back to source editor when needed, in which the changes made in the VPL; editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Working with the VPL; editor in a document containing & PHP; contains a small green symbol displaying the Vohandze of & PHP; it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; to edit it, the source text editor is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first one, except that at the same time the changes in the source text editor and the VPL; editor are visible and the cursor is active in the source text editor and in the VPL; with pressing F9, this mode is already active, the keystroke activates the active cursor from one window to the other, maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings Quanta. after choosing VPL; you can choose between synchronization by one click or automatically. in general, the recommendation is: a small range for fast computers and a large margin for slow computers.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Assuming you want to change the title of the website, it is possible to select document properties. this allows the editing of invisible tags at work with the VPL; editor. the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document with the VPL; editor is created.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information on the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons down. one click in the list allows changing the content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>

<seg id="2224">Cursors are used as in a word processor, by moving with arrows. under rare circumstances, the cursor behaves strange. the marker functions as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleted by means of a button or a rangebutton.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way via the toolbars, as in the source text editor. it must be noted that the insertion of tags is not removed before already existing identical tags, e.g. when an anchor tag, surrounded with text, must be removed any other surrounding anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars like the table assistant or the Lists Wizard are disabled. they will work later in & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists must be used toolbars.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time adjusted the indentation to many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts when merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines. and there were no references to the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a little nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, any amount of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare notes, just copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that did a lot of work was the comparability and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost in a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two people work independently of each other in a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; for folder merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and follows the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently need to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabulators are displayed. if rows differ only in a certain number of white characters, you can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble if someone changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can make typing by typing just the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder-1 folder-2 folder-1 folder-2 -o target folder kdiff3 folder-1 folder-2 folder-2 folder-3 -o target folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening Dialogue enables manual typing of filenames, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C blank, the analysis of differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Click on the folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, however, if a file is selected, for B and C a folder, then use & kdiff3; the file name from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is enabled, the input field is active and can be processed. however, it is not necessary to immediately specify an output file. you can also do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Configuration button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before starting comparing / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard to the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in the opening dialog, you do not have to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which idea is behind it? sometimes, a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, this would be a relatively big effort. you just need to create two corresponding files, load them in & kdiff3, and then compare them. now you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you cannot extract anything from & kdiff3; only dropping text into a comparison window will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and dragging of text into another program as cutting and pasting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) Every info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse over the line for a while. then a small helpdesk will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three spring windows are the letters A, B and C assigned. a has the color blue, B the color Green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, you can see which file is different. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files. this is good to see in the next section (merging).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in rare rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line dividing the merge column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines. if the line breaks are enabled, the line is represented on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison windows) also has an info line with the wording issue:, the filename and [...] if you edited the result. usually it contains already text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the Springe button to the next dissolved / unresolved conflict to find still remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference is at the same time a conflict that must be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the line will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed. (this will also make a jump in the position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black beam.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging or by manually editing; then in these lines the text & lt; No row in the queue; appears. this is only a placeholder for the event that you change your mind and maybe select another source. this text does not appear in the final stored file, nor in a marker you may copy and paste elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources options ignoring numbers or ignoring C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, side up, side down, beginning, end, Ctrl start and Ctrl end, Siw as you are used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the display window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the Insert key, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as already explained in the merge and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Down / Strg-Up), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Down / Ctrl-Image Abroad) or to the next / previous unsolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking to the clipboard, you must copy the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-paste). it is also possible to copy the option selection automatically. if this is enabled, whatever you tick is automatically copied to the clipboard and the manual copy is omitted. be careful with this option as you could accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline\\ r\ r\ r\ r\\ r\. KDiff3 does not retain the line end of the source files, so you should not use & kdiff3, nor with binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of recently used files will be automatically saved in the end and restored at the next start. (menu Settings- &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences in italic text will be displayed. if the chosen font does not support this display, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors may not be available in their pure form, but would be rendered scanned. on these systems, the preset button automatically sets an undefined color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is checked, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tab character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press Enter or Return, the input of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is checked, each selection will automatically be copied to the clipboard. the manual copy to the clipboard is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-end type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kdiff3; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step, white characters are ignored. even when merging white characters are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a carriage return character '\\ r' and a line feed '\' at the end of a line, but then files with different sizes may look identical in the page-to-side comparison, although they are different. during the merge, this option must be deactivated. in default, this is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is deactivated. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is deactivated. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensely search for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slow in very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In Automatic skip mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next unresolved conflict is passed.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Solve all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important. if you only need this from time to time, then use better the Select A / B / C functions for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ignore C / C + + comments are activated.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are dealt with in the chapter on the scanning of folders and conducting a merge. look for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge tracking.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, the original version will be appended to the suffix .orig. if a backup file already exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapting this option does not affect the current running program. you must & kdiff3; quit and restart to make the change active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set for each entry separately. if enabled, the top setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Above the selection fields for encoding, a brief note appears, which is the local code. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually configurable, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which code to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessor commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the preprocessor can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of preprocessor commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this down to suppress highlighting of changes in white characters in text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ignore C / C + + comments are activated.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color coded oversee column. but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files. depending on the selection of A & lt; s; B, A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; & gt; C will appear next to the normal, a second overfeit column with the information you need.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would rather like to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply stop the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Assign the comparison window side by side or above each other. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you view the differences and then decide to merge the files together. a simple click starts the merge and uses the filename of the last source file as default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will first hand over to this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command will be visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that exactly meets your needs. you can use this function for example to cut out disturbing parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command has been specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this preprocessor command. you can write your own preprocessor that meets your needs. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is that the user needs more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program this themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for line trunks to convert the input into uppercase letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 /\\\ 1 /\\\ 1 /\\\ 1 /\\\ 1 /\\\ 1 /\\ 1 /\\ 1 /\\ 1 /\\ 1 /\\ 1 /\\ 1.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert generated strings (info: / cvs / Keyword substitution). all following the same pattern $keyword is required.</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you may start to understand it and perhaps you may even like those regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of another preprocessor for line equivalent. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and any hit is replaced by nothing, thus quasi deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from one another. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else such as perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replacement / SCHALTER 'Allerdings are different in perl some details. where used\\ (and\\), perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to the normal preprocessor will be retained for displaying and merging. other operations only change the data that the line reconciliation algorithm sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the newline preprocessor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any feature that changes text or hides differences, you may not accidentally notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge complete folders with & kdiff3; complete folders.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can adjust the suggestion before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merging and display the simulated changes without actually performing them,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... takes selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging single files. you just have to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no destination folder was specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not merging. to start merging, you must select the corresponding menu item or press the F7 key. (more details will follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you will be informed of a small message window about the current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folders, only the files that have been compared until then are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the scanning of the folder is complete, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder that was found during the scan is displayed in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually displayed together. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - or double-clicking on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right. the menu menu provides two functions to fold all subdirectories with which you can open all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click on a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be selected automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the picture above, the A / B / C columns are used in red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries, however, the color is also identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical when their entire content is identical. then, folders also have the same color. in folders, the age is insignificant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirtiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow becomes and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for syncing is active, if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified and if the option directories are active. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filenames for the output file only B; copied directly after merging & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge (unsafe), then investigate & kdiff3; the date of files and then suggests the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the same date appears, then an error message appears: files are not removed, the merging of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While merging one file after the other, it displays a file after the merge operation has been successful, and according to other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is completed, you should make a final check and check if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If Full analysis is selected in the setup dialog, KDiff3 will display other columns. these include the number of unresolved, deleted, not white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you don't have a destination folder, then in the three-folder merging mode, C will be used as the target. in the two-folder merging, B is chosen as destination and used for syncing A and / or B as destination.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check if all entries should be in the destination folder, also in the folder structure. there are some options that might be skipped by certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge start / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the key shortcut). to just add the current entry: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If conflicting file types still exist invalid merge actions, a message appears on the incorrect elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all the entries, a dialog box appears with the options Conduct, Simulate and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Please choose Simulate if you first want to see what would happen without actually making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), a merge window will open (note the screen shot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, select / continue directory merge again or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog will appear. then & kdiff3 will continue its work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">When you continue merging (F7 key), you will see some error messages that will help you decide the cause of the problem. if you continue merging (F7 key), you can choose to try another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before you continue merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged, you will see & kdiff3; these entries will not be merged again later. even if the merge operation has been skipped or not stored, these entries are considered to be done. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Edit menu of & kdiff3; (menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files matching the specified pattern will be displayed in the element tree. separate the patterns with a semicolon;. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as a separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as a separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignores files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this can be set folder-specific with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a default attribute. in other filesystems, a previous point marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When the option is off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is turned off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the links will be treated like normal folders and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; does not check for possible recursions. a link to a folder containing a link on itself would result in a loop loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns. (the number of dissolved, unsolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files containing no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders using a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed benefit will cost you a certain degree of security. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the date of change. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identically, if they are equal. this can be useful, for example, when copying the change date. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the syncing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are chosen so that both folders are identical. the results of merging files are also stored in both folders. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging the newer file, it will be proposed as action. (this is considered unsafe because it is assumed that the other file has not been changed.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced by another or deleted, then the original version is renamed and gets the extension .orig.If an old backup file already exists with the .orig extension, then it will be deleted without further backup. this also concerns the normal merging of individual files, not just the merge of whole folders. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder merge view is visible when merging single files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want this, you can switch the window divider in the window menu and switch between the two views using the directory & text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You probably prefer to compare a file simply by double-clicking. however, you can merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge. to do so, you can run a single file directly from the merge menu.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost if you re-read the directory: directory menu: re-reading</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency using KIO slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders.</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative. or.. contain. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, blank &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then a file will always be accepted as a link destination. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change date. therefore, the permissions or change date differ from the original. (note the option Confidential of size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently available as a difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP will first always start the built-in difference viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In KDiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally requires & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, if it is used as a part, & kdiff3; indicate that the input file is a patch file in unified format. then remove & kdiff3; the names of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then start & kdiff3; the patch program to recover the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select Preview in - KDiff3Part from the Context menu. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; being executed as part, it only supports the comparing of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiffuser (now available) are already available. furthermore, the name KDiffuser has already indicated that it can merge as the program diff3 from the Diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I already use GPL programs for a long time and have learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or let him go.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably didn't tell the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. in default, configure is installed in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this subject.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical; however, if only one non-white character is different, the line is treated as non-identical.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notices each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this is necessary to easily resolve a conflict by clicking in the source text and selecting the button A / B / C. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">You can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger quantities of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is flushed out; No src left; and the text cannot be deleted. what does this mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; already uses many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You can find a list of recent changes under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the file ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir indicates the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; auto-conf and automake, you should not have any problems with compiling. if you still encounter difficulties, please report on the & kde; mailing lists of this.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut off (Ctrl-X or Shift Delete) Copy to clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-Insert) add the text from clipboard to the current cursor position or replace the current marking.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only show differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you need to re-read the folder with the update after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries showing differences. this also causes identical files to merge into the destination folder. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the lettering A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed by clicking the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is deactivated. understatement in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; displays a thumbnail of all virtual workspaces. it is quite handy to see the running programs on the worktops, change their size, end them or shift them. this works both within a desktop as well as several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual working spaces as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and moved even on the desktop and on others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, window inside & Kpager can be moved. movement is possible both within a desktop and other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: when clicked on the empty background of & Kpager, the context menu only has to set up the two entries Pager... and end. if, however, on an application within & Kpager; clicked, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize, maximize, on desktop and end.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows inside the & Kpager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is crossed, the & Kpager will display the names of the virtual workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field lets the & Kpager; display the numbers of virtual workspaces. if it is crossed with name, the names will be given with ordinal numbers, eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is enabled, the background of each desktop is displayed as background in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is enabled, the current programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise, only empty workspaces will be displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here is the view of the program window. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the window with its default icon and Pixmap shows a small view of the actual program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; main window can be determined: classically & Kpager; in a 2xN raster, as from Pager applications in some other window managers, horizontally shows all virtual worktops in a horizontal row, which is very good for displaying laterally on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display and move windows as symbols or with their content. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager, and set up switch-up selector... lets the dialog appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment this cannot be changed in the dialog settings. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you do not have write permission for the file, you must log in as user root or turn to your system administrator.</seg>

<seg id="2480">& Kmag; is a screen saver. you can use & Kmag to increase a part of the screen, as if you read a magnifying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo. this application is intended for various users: including artists, web designers and people with visual impairment. this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of & Kmag.</seg>
<seg id="2481">& Kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended with new features. it is optimized for use on high-performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you & Kmag; start, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & Kmag; displays the magnified area of the screen. in the following, this window is called magnification window. the image shown in the magnifying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In default, magnified & clicked; the area around the mouse cursor as a moving loupe. alternatively you can & Kmag; for this cause a selected screen area in the magnification window (selection window mode) or the surroundings of the mouse-pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; at the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window, select the mouse cursor setting. please note, that & Kmag; currently not able to detect the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the default node; / Qt; mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection window mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse-cursor into the magnification window and hold the left mouse button, so you can capture and move the content of the magnification window. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you press additionally the & Shift; press button or the & MMB; use, you can move the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">This combination allows you to change the size of the selection window. note that the top left corner of the drop-down window is fixed and only the lower right corner is moved.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& Kmag; has a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer, save it to a file, copy it to the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), rotate the image and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Starts or stops updating the display. stopping the updating causes the needed CPU time to go against zero.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the update rate (Very low, Low, Medium, High, Very High). the higher the update rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode, a selection window appears. the selected area is displayed in a window.</seg>
<seg id="2493">& Kmag; automatically uses your set short commands to save files, open a new window, print, newbies (with the button document recharge in & konqueror;), enlarge and size & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2494">Kmag also known as & kmagnifier; is a screen magnifier; use an area of screen to enlarge as if you would use a magnifier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo. this application is useful for various people: from research or artist to web designer or visual impairment.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click as soon as the mouse cursor waits for a while at the same place. it is meant to help people who suffer from the repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and emulate pain to each mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may also suffer from pain caused by the use of your computer if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To clarify this again: even if & kmousetool; to avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click as soon as you break the motion briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the clever move is activated, it makes & kmousetool; a pause after pressing the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the mouse button is pressed. in this way you can execute the drag with pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must be enough after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool.</seg>

<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking through mouse-postponement. if this function is activated, a slow moving is generated to the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with right mouse button. these movements are saved in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool; the first time is started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound appears, you can & kde; move to shorten the response time. go to the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, choose Sound System and here the tab General. there is a slider sound buffer that you can set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool is started at any start of & kde; this function is currently only available under & kde; available. at GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. if you have already pressed the Apply button, the settings will be reset to the stand after the last click.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool, first with the default settings. in particular, the smart shifting you should let off first. if you have got used to the automatic mouse click, you can later take the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in case of sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not represent a link does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to take the mouse ball out. how this happens is different from mouse to mouse. however, it should be clear if you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you'd have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. you can easily scratch the dirt and dirt with a flat blade or fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you use the smart move in this case, that means that & kmousetool will stop the operation by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you are using & kmousetool; use a different window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click. by this, the status of & kmousetool will be reset and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to where you want to have it. however, use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to make a keystroke. this can cause an accidental moving of the mouse pointer. secure zones for the mouse cursor are & eg; the grey areas around the toolbars and menus and the front lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart move, but I don't create it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The clever move is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very probably possible to select text, copy it into the clipboard and insert it again or execute any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just start using & kmousetool. instead, select text instead: run a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouseclick. this is played every time, when & kmousetool; the mouse button pushes a sound like a mouse click away. so you know exactly when the move time begins when it is smart. later, you can use the intelligent move even without the audible mouseclick.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool, the Xtest extension for & X windows needs to be installed. this should be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse-click is only available when the system has a sound card and loudspeaker and is correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; activate the mouse button as soon as the mouse cursor remains short. this program was developed for people suffering from RSI's syndrome and pain is causing pain.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to start a drag procedure before releasing the mouse button. in this way, dragging and dragging with the mouse can also be done.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced features of & ktops;. for normal work with & tts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Filters are processed before being sent to the speech speech. they are useful for improving pronunciation, to replace false spoken words or abbreviations, to select a suitable language and speaker, or to circumvent certain shortcomings of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the operation of filters, it is important to know how the program "speech dispatcher" works with a text. & ktops; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and holds these jobs. if the output of the screen reader is read, the retained orders will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important messages such as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning has precedence and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will resume after issuing the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg; read a long text on a website, you can go with & kmouth; notifications are also messages.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. every order you apply from the card card is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the edition of longer texts, which have no special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues, except the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen readers while & ktops; just one such read, this output will stop and stop.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters are never applied to screen readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there may be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be provided either as words or as regular expressions. & ktops; will be delivered with predefined string replacement filters that allow the creation of chat-emoticons such as: -) by text or for formatting messages from & konversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable way.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; converters use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from one format to another format. in the scope of delivery of & ktops; some XSLT files are included for the translation of & XHTML; included in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With subscriber selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to & ktops; sent to a speaker for example. if you have selected a female voice for example, you can read text from KDE messages about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules, to which it is applied for speech output. if the filter determines that its rules do not apply, it continues the text to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; message to & ktam; sent, it is processed by all activated filters installed on the bottom. processing by the filter is done in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of normal filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed by the set up downwards.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to add a new filter. select the type of filter, and the further below setup dialogs are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2638">If these patterns are found in the text, the text will be exchanged against the corresponding replacement text. large and lowercase is not considered when compared.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name as you wish, it has to differ only from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Replace. the list is processed in the shown order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. download a list of a file, the entries from the file will be appended to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter is applied only if the spokesperson for the text order speaks one of the languages listed here. click the button to view a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you press the & Ctrl button at the click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID running programs get you with the program qdbus;. the & dbus; -numbers must be omitted. if for example & qdbus; the application ID copied-3432, you may only enter a copy.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The filter replacement filter is applied to the text only if all the conditions with an entry in the Diesen filter box apply when matching. if all input fields are empty, the filter will be applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the string release filter uses regular expressions in the\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will find no instructions to write regular expressions. but if you have installed the & kde; editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; expressions found in the package cunutils.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to highlight text for voice output. this standard includes trademarks for controlling voices, speaking speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktops; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are present:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (British manly) as this is the standard voice, the festival uses in the output of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or sound in the festival configuration dialog are not limited to 100, SSML is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and punctuation filters (SDB filters). SBDs can switch text into single sentences. thus, you can start or stop or stop orders quickly on the card card, even if the speech synthesizer does not directly support this.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the propositional boundary recognition filter. at the first start of & ktops, a set delimiter filter filter is set up as default. you can change its settings or add another set of rules filters, beginners will be discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn how to set the subscriber selection by trying out. switch the subscriber selector and enter text to read. switch to the box selection again, change some features and check how the speaker's selection is changed.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktops; then proceed faster with reading, since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can take very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can apply text orders on the card card or cancel orders even if the speech synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the regular line recognition filter is set up automatically when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be shut off, only removed. do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Punctuation filters compare text with a regular expression for punctuation and add a tab mark (decimal code 8) to the propositional boundaries. (tab marks are automatically removed from the text before filtering).</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (knotify), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal set delimiter filter by mistake, you can insert it again by uploading the standard _ sbdrc file contained in & ktops.</seg>
<seg id="2736">"" "on the" "" "subscriber" "" "card menu, you can override the subscriber settings for the application." ""</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top on the card reader). in other words: no speech characteristics are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate speaker with all the features of a furnished speaker. if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker, choose & edit; otherwise select & tt; the speaker that best matches the original features.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired subscriber properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the subscriber here. if this feature does not play a role, do not enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Tick this check box if the property is to take precedence over other properties. you can also set several marks here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output, it is always treated as a priority property. you will rarely use this property. the only case you may want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application text is sent in a different language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the features in the speaker area, which is most likely to erase the following, click the standard speaker button and then use the speaker that best matches the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case 0 for the last text order is in the queue. you can also specify a job number. (without order number the input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr crashes immediately when it is started. I have compiled Debug support, but I do not get traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer has crashed and & ktops; it was finished. probably you need to register GStreamer. if the problem is not resolved, it is possible to install a non-compatible version of GStreamer. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>

<seg id="2749">I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet. I installed it and can use it in festival, but ktmgr shows this voice not.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / ecttsd / festivalint / vocals. as guidance you can use the other entries. if this is successful, please send a patch together with the & URL; on which you found the voice to the developer.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the map audio there is a setting speed. so this works, the program needs to be installed sox and be discoverable by the environment variable PATH. some SynthesizerModules such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed even on the card card for subscriber unit. depending on the selected voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for speaking speed are ignored when & ktops; & HTML; read. (this is because the HTML is converted to SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for converting & HTML; after & XML; (see) or, if you are quite brave, change the .xsl file of & HTML; -after-SSML formerfilter, and set up the speaking speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't create websites with a female voice. I have set up a female festival speaker but & ktops; reads the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta, the tag Sable GENDER does not appear to work. so that festival does not produce any errors, the xsl file rejects the GENDER tags. the same also applies to the VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added a separate chain replace filter and now I can in & ktops; no more I can move forward or go back. on the precursor of orders is shown, the order is only composed of one sentence. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">You may not filter punctuation marks (point, question marks, exclamation marks, comma and semicolon). instead, use a filter for set limit detection instead.</seg>

<seg id="2759">Some users experience conflicts in the audio output in connection with ALSA. if your system counts, you can not simultaneously play music and read a text. & ktops; also freezes when you stop a text order and then start another. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the ALSA (dmix) website.</seg>
<seg id="2760">As of July 2005, aCode does not yet support real breaks. if you hold a text order in & ktops, the current set is still being read.</seg>

<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers whose source code is open. the quality of the voices is generally good, and several voices and languages are supported. in many voices you can adjust volume, speaking speed and pitch with & ktops.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You must install at least one language. help can be found in the instructions provided with the Festival. if you want to read websites, you need to install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. the German voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The voice is still in an early stage of development. unzip the software in festival / lib / vocals / russian /. if you set up the Russian voices you need to enter the voice MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. select a Cyrillic (8-bit) encoding such as koi8-R.</seg>

<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices when installing & Linux are installed and set up. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings module is loaded when the option network settings are selected in the & kcontrolcenter; -Index. when starting the module network settings, this system attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list that best meets the distribution and the release edge. by marking the setting of non-re-enquiries, the definition can be made permanently. the next start of the network settings will then automatically set this selection.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is possible only in system management mode. before, all options are displayed gray, meaning the settings can be viewed only, changing is not possible. in system management mode, you can enter system management mode at the lower end of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab Network interfaces are used to manage the system's network devices. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the tab Network Interface:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings displayed on the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button of the button... to set up in the dialog device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to display the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system are performed at the same time with the start of the system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all necessary TCP / IP settings for each system start, so no further adjustment is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the option Manuell, the TCP / IP configuration can be made without DHCP or BOOTP. in the IP address input field the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the network mask, the sub-netmask must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface during booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. ping in the & Console; you can see if the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off, depending on the needs. switching on an outdated network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off, depending on the needs. turn off an enabled network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the host in the local subnet, which communicates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with hosts in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface to the network where the gateway computer is located must be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the computer requires http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS triggers this name to an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution calculator can be used to easily manage this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS records can be added to priority by selecting an entry and grading in the list with buttons Hints or Heroes.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button Add... from the group calculator to the name resolution you can add a DNS server. it will display the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to the name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button.... It will display the dialog editing.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The name of name known by name describes the hostname-to-IP address ID for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used by booting when no DNS servers are available. in small, remote networks it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually the list includes some entries that support & apos; localhost apos; and support some special IPv6 addresses. this still in the test version of IP should replace version 4 in the future version.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known calculator and click Add... The New Alias dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known calculator and click the Add button. if the known calculator has multiple alias names, press the add multiple times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a name known by name from the list and select Edit... Open the Friends machine will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be executed one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system. to enable the changes, the following command must be set in a & console.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; ist http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (mostly rpm packages) it is enough if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the ready-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & console; install rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool for your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is not sufficient, but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology is given; in the second section all of & knetworkconf are discussed; changing configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP Version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found great dissemination. IPv6 is expected to be consistent in the near future. therefore, this description is currently focusing on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is to assign. in external networks, on the pier, the network administrator is the contact person who runs a valid IP address or if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address can not be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.049; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = your own computer).</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, you will find the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf and where they are stored in the different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed dynamically with DSL connections, so it won't be surprised if there is another content to be found there in case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is re-sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand as expected may therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& dat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it provides the ability to create multiple archives on one tape. the first one was to create a surface for tar, which additionally provided the ability of dds2tar for quick, selective extracting. the second goal was to answer a question that my wife put: how much longer does it take to secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be involved from & kdat; it can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& dat; ult the band back and read the pre-tensioning information of the tape. recognize & kdat; don't know the advance on the tape, you'll be asked if the tape should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & dat; it searches for the right index on your disk. if this is not found, you will be asked if the belt index is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes in order to indicate that the tape was embedded. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the content of the tape can now be browsed by folding the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before casting the strap, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& dat; by changing the symbol for the band to recognize that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & kdat, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type must be formatted before you can be used to save data. this process does not match formatting at & kdat; If your tape drive needs to be formatted before use, this must happen before you can be formatted by the tape from & kdat; floppy tape drives usually require formatting the tape, DAT drives on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and capacity, the tape continues. all the data on the tape is lost! after completing the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only backup this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the files and / or subfolders selected will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select Save...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been initiated, the dialog opens up for backup. in this dialog, you can check once again the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">When you confirm the settings, the dialog appears. the dialog displays the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. it will only check the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Rightclick in one of the archives and select the menu entry...</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the check process has been started, the dialog appears for verification. in this dialog, you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the review settings, the dialog appears. this dialog will show the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can re-establish the restore, the files to be restored must be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive entry. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives using a tick. only the files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Rightclick a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been started, the dialog appears for recovery. in this dialog, you can check your selection once again and change the job folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for the restoration, the dialog appears again. this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to recreate the band indexfile using the band content. this process clears all existing index files for this volume. you can create the index on two types of the tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current job folder in which the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, only the files in it are backed up that are located on the same filesystem as the folder. folders that are on other filesystems can be entered separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar independent of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before the tar call. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & lt; lt; files had not yet been fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings using the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. the following settings can be done:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding version of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmitted & dat; before the tape is incorporated, the command blocks load to the drive. in some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; lock the cast off the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, it will automatically discard the tape when resolving the integration of & kdat. do not use this option on floppy-floppy disks.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; to change the hardware-like block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you must tell & kdat; in any case, the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">When & kdat; a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only show a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is hostname: seconds, where hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the period in which the tape was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup tape. this symbol is only active when a band is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system supports the various protocol files. moreover, & ksystemlog; experienced users access quick access to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users to understand what your computer is doing in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified presentation of the protocol files of your system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog allows experienced users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore attempts to provide some advanced features, with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, it provides & ksystemlog; features available to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a log file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start & ksystemlog, first the most important log file of the system - the system log - will open. if you don't display it, and it opens up instead of a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; most likely do not run with system administrator rights. the protocol files are usually found in the / var / log file, for which normal users usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter by selecting a selected criterion or string. the list of the log lines will now be changed automatically so that only log lines will be displayed. in default, a log line will be displayed only if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can, of course, select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the appropriate column. in addition, in the Protocol file system protocol, select the column process, and apply in the filterbar the name of a process, so show you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of the level error are displayed with a more noticeable color than protocol lines of the level hint. the colored representation of protocol lines can be shut down setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">For example, if you want to display a specific process (e.g. in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can show the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use the filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can jump to new lines in the main window context menu to view all the new log lines added.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub-windows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find further information about the Sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also found in the following folder of the & kde; Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and so named) as & ksysv; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init quickly becomes the standard for controlling the program start when running the system in the & Linux; this is because it is easier to use, more powerful, and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and re-formatting. that's why you need to make sure the old init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init differs also from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for each system service that you want to start when running the system or switching to another runlevel. system services include such things as network, NFS, & sendmail; system services, on the other hand, do not include such things as setserial, which is only launched once. such calls are to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be in / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file even if there is not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port when you start up.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in different places after the program init and starts the first one that it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default all-level is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default all-level 3 is. if you want to change this, you can edit / etc / inittab from hand and change the 3. be very careful if you have messed up the inittab.</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains a K, the script is called with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be invoked with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; have a server runlevel which can run only httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc. in addition, I could also have a user runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or other hand device is easy to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevels to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between levels or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. in doing so, the entry is removed from its original runlevel (or position). this only happens if you pull out an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you move them to a new area. in order to only copy them to a new level, you must explicitly choose to copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert them into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there is currently no way to restore entries thrown into the Recycle Bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different work areas (Available System Services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with insertion (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or name of an entry manually, press the input key to open the Properties dialog. use the tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of loss of data, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if available. otherwise, they are recovered by & ksysv; changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with standard runleveln, and now the machine starts to restart. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single-user mode. then edit the / etc / inittab file and change the standard runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; intended for running Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE, or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are launched in these distributions makes it easy to configure for the proprietary set-up programs of these distributions but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution, please check if all configuration files are available that are needed by the system service (and whether they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply quit without a message if their configuration files are not available or set incorrectly.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you are using another distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that they can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser, it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to begin reading.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made any changes you need to save them. either you use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or save the item in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two card cards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or the desired group with double click on the entry. it appears the dialog for user and group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are displayed only if you have advanced system settings. only if you have enabled limited restrictions (quota) for users, a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings. other cards may appear if Shadow -passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD domains.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card-card password management appears in case of Shadow -passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd like in BSD domains.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card only appears if for at least one filesystem space constraint (quota) is enabled and initialized (recognizable by the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here, parameters can be changed for each user, with the limited space limitations each data in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current filesystem is selected with the help of the field filesystem with space constraints.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card card groups informs about the group affiliations of the selected user. the default group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the user or group or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group works analogue.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO boot manager, add, remove and change the boot password, change the time to boot the default operating system, add, remove, add, add, remove, change, and more.</seg>
