although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American writers and practi@@ sed his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American movie .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , how he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican cover , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , revealed the murder@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate who wanted to occupy the upper federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; freely to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was like this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA only strengthened .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very fan@@ ati@@ cal love letter about its size .
then came Donald Tru@@ mp .
much was written about the xen@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never thinks of the mountain in his opinion , as you say so nicely .
he tells exactly what he thinks as a former colleague expressed it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and voted for him in pairs .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can elections was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever achieved .
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ?
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tru@@ mp and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program that takes people from all over the world , a deeply dev@@ out person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and its past .
the Tru@@ mp@@ s Welt@@ anschau@@ ung did not correspond with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s In@@ tolerance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights for the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
she still fits to the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Fein@@ ey , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values represented by them deep@@ ened my love towards America .
while Tru@@ mp accepted his way to the nom@@ inees Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
but it turned out that they were the exception to rule .
on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly white , gave the presi@@ dency to a man , despite - or perhaps precisely because of his contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp because they shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it &apos;s unfair to call the Tru@@ mp voters as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy people , one of my friends said , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and respect@@ ful and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their worries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom know , voted for Tru@@ mp , because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in America ?
perhaps .
however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comments on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contemp@@ t on those who look different from him .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( WC . ) : as much like &quot; white against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities , &quot; the white and whi@@ plas@@ h word play , which means as much as the Great Van Jones , has killed exactly what America has done so splen@@ did@@ ly .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which belief or background you may always have , America is welcome everybody .
for this land chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history as he himself says nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the election of Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , however , there is a huge part of the white American saying this promise and says : to Hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word of words with the crowd .
Donald Tru@@ mp , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan ended in saying : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , it is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son fell , sent him a message .
this is Tru@@ mp@@ s Land now , said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recy@@ cled Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .
image of Fli@@ ck@@ r user O@@ EA @-@ O@@ AS ( CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 ) .
what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura together ?
that the music that is played in both places not only has changed the life of the children , but also a very close relationship with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an ancient colonial city that is popular among tourists - but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Music ban@@ de ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults who have found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become central to the church of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico is known for its use of drugs and ban@@ anas .
but after a random encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare g@@ lim@@ mer of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , the local press not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI writes :
as soon as they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the hu@@ stle you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga to play .
music from garbage
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that lies practically on top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made from recycled waste material :
music with re@@ processed instruments made up of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the Recycl@@ er led by F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez began turning parts of waste into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ a , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all of which were made out of the tr@@ ash .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez re@@ members a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , at the beginning time :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage The kids knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a violin made of tr@@ ash .
today there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments made of re@@ processed material and which calls itself The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentary called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world generates about one billion tons of garbage every year .
those who live with him and of him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspiring performance from tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
the re@@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the joint use of content .
in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia &apos;s waters before the other coast of Africa sought .
the East African countries were correspon@@ d@@ ingly upset and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this species at their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ ators , Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobil@@ ised against the ship . they refused to stamp one of their ports and refused to grant him a fisher@@ man &apos;s license .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior officer of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was expelled from the waters of the region : it was not successful to catch fish there .
in the end , it was forced to pay $ 2 million in Liberia for pil@@ lage of the land &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries that was founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal F@@ ish@@ eries ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries who had expelled the Premier from their waters at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . this makes illegal fishing a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
by the deliberate dis@@ regard of existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fish@@ eries can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les , and also by the sn@@ ail &apos;s pace , with information between individual countries , the actions are happening in real time , trac@@ eable to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing lic@@ ences , news on susp@@ icious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea , via satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas . also , such susp@@ icious routes can be detected - such as those suggest@@ ing that a ship loads its captured fish on the way to other ships .
ideally such studies can show whether the ships involved have a fishing license where they were on the go and possibly whether they have a pen@@ al code .
on the basis of this information , countries that are opposed to illegal fishing may refuse to accept such vessels in their ports . what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then it &apos;s about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue which the eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network lose each year because of illegal fishermen entering East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries that attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also illegal fishermen .
their practices include such actions as sailing under false flag , fake license papers , speci@@ fying fantasi@@ es , fishing protected species and fishing in protected areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ broken control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier , a ship was able to fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You wouldn &apos;t run my port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has participated in more than 30 studies of susp@@ icious ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake lic@@ ences in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found wing @-@ wing ships .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency for the fight against crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that aims to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate susp@@ icious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to detect the illegal ships that would like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , head analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO which also deals with fish@@ eries data and provides technical support to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , switch off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information . F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i will help to find criminal operating ships with greater precision .
one model program
but F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence this undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , president of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform with Google and the marine protection organization Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be used to display the position of every single tra@@ ck@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors , to get a better picture of who does what , it simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Le@@ v Char@@ itable tru@@ sts has a similar project where a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only det@@ ra@@ ct criminals but also deter them .
ships that were f@@ ished without a license and had hardly expected consequences now know that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now have a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales since f@@ isher boats buy more lic@@ ences .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to detect Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tow@@ ing nets where they were banned .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ il@@ u says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , six countries joined forces to join the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With certainty , the aim of even more such initiatives and structures is to be made in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia was able to announce its first big triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the way under a false flag . and not only was the ship on the road without a license and used tow@@ ing nets which are now prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also inv@@ aded into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 is a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time evidence that such a collaborative working method for the protection of the oceans actually works across the world ocean . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . there she writes about the environment , technology and nutrition .
their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela is escal@@ ating further : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; re@@ covering the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered to be a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the inauguration of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .
this picture of María Ale@@ j@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a close @-@ up of the demonstration in Mar@@ ac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 .

after the government rejected the proposal of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empt@@ iness , re@@ acting to the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the return of Venezuela ) pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country - including in the inland area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the central north @-@ north country of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and at the Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country continuously deterior@@ ates , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw in the removal of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , the chance for a fundamental change ; however , the reluct@@ ance of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ or at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summ@@ arises the context of the government decision in its latest article :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , where inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated to be 500 % for the end of the year ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine is , the referendum needed to give the country a chance to regain its institutional structures and to establish a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ á@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( approximately : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined together , urged the demonstr@@ ators to continue on 27 October to support the National Assembly . in addition , a twelve @-@ hour strike on the Fol@@ kt@@ ag and a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , should continue to continue .
the call was commented on Twitter , among others , as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday national civil strike and on 3 November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen as well as pro@@ pon@@ ents of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most frequently shared images shows a demonstr@@ ator who calls through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this Venezu@@ el@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Twitter collects images that talk about arguments , as well as reports of repression and abuse .
particularly large waves struck the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government according to their own statement .
hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral once more , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an state of T@@ á@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many National Gu@@ ards do not have !
meanwhile an inf@@ ographic already accounts for the extent of suppression per day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a accession procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the road .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the signatures are fake .
here is your removal !
on the road !
others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has done little against the devastating economic crisis in their view , and preferred to ignore critical voices :
they have taken us so much - but also fear !
mar@@ ches always increase in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans told the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike rather than work or go shopping .

this is an adaptation of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , who was published on August 23 , 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine news site .
the interview was translated into English and published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to see the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of Córdoba .
as an adult , Qui@@ j@@ ano now said in the context of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial in the province of Córdoba against his father .
the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , was subjected to crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
beginning with the burden of bearing the same name as his father , up to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept family secrets .
in the situation at that time I thought it was okay .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child at the age of 15 one does not realize that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I couldn &apos;t realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turers and murder@@ ers .
Luis was not a choice : his father , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano , was a gendar@@ mer@@ officer . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was the deputy commander of the intelligence department 141 in La Per@@ la prison until 1978 .

this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who was charged with kidn@@ apping in 15@@ 8 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and kidn@@ apping a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had experienced as a boy , and who testified before a Federal Constitutional Court against his own father .
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they called him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend on that .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you made yourself friends with one of the ERP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just that they don &apos;t dec@@ eive you one day and I have to save you . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party of Argentina .
therefore he charged me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later , he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become sec@@ rec@@ y .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok . because so my father educated me .
on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all sorts of documents : University degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then the prisoners are tortured &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - all in 1976 .
during the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a barracks , in cars , furniture , television , fri@@ dges - just everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a little pack@@ et wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver there .
on that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen objects were dropped and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tortured .
I sp@@ ed in and saw a lie that men were tortured .
she looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there .
they seldom bind a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty di@@ aper .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I immediately recognized the smell and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I never forgot this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another person ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and wore eye relief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he spoke with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also charged in the process ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying down with the face - all were tied at hands and feet .
close to the entrance , people che@@ wed quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you get me here ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , there were some rooms that were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero assembled and killed a man there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to figures of survivors the civilian is Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged in La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera &apos;s trial , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , director of La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way the ab@@ duc@@ tions came here .
if you look at the map , you will see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above was to be transferred .
this was the lie - euph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war yield &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spo@@ ils of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when I was in the army later , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war @-@ war is a bay@@ on@@ et , or perhaps military signs , which one has fought against an enemy that has been fought .

but if one goes into a house and the refrigerator , the record player , clothing , painting , money ... ste@@ als , this is not a war yield but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I was always asking myself how my father , the head of security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you who steal cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded in rage , struck me and scre@@ amed :
when you go so far , I will find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need anyone else !
so my father was .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
when I was in the process , I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a wo@@ ollen jacket pul@@ lover . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes home .
at that time , the defence accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay down to me what they wanted .
I was there anyway to testify .
&apos;@@ The disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last abom@@ inable act &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel regret .
I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you were exec@@ uting people during the dictatorship , but why did the bodies disappear ?
why do children kidn@@ ap ?
one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
it would have been easy to put them in prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why did their bodies disappear ?
did these people not even have families , to whom one could commit their mortal remains ?
the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last abom@@ inable act that man can do .
my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they brought machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course anything remains .
&apos;@@ i saw how you killed people ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the thought to display my father was created during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him repro@@ aches because of all the atro@@ cities I had to witness for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked myself why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; western and Christian feelings &quot; they allegedly defended were actually good .
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something ?
I saw how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then tell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I re@@ funds the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
nobody can blame me for being pre@@ occupied . I finally testified against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest or before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : including severe , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 15@@ 8 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 severe cases , torture with subsequent death in five cases and a case of ab@@ duction of a child under 10 years old .

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 The oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to life imprisonment in 28 cases , and in nine cases prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years .
eleven of the originally 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ imer : murder , torture and rape by officials .
all def@@ endants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he directed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people murdered during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted for more than three years , but the research for it lasted 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial could be established there , which is now led by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; translation error makes elderly people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation mistake at a centre in Kyoto , where one can extend his driving licence .
the photo was circul@@ ated in the social media .
adaptation of Joshua Lev@@ ine &apos;s original photos .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can pro@@ long his driving licence , last month witnessed a very un@@ fortunate translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a shield , the Japanese word was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; fal@@ sely - perhaps even with evil h@@ ind thanks &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dre@@ ad@@ ful mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September .
adaptation of Joshua Lev@@ ine &apos;s original photos , which was often shared in the social media .
the mistake was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , an inhabit@@ ant of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the in @-@ house daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could such an English translation come about ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bad English translation was removed first . the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , if also gram@@ mati@@ cally correct name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police pre@@ f@@ ecture of Kyoto ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation mistake . furthermore , she explained that the error was already included in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for their accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger covered the ap@@ ologies as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that elderly people felt insul@@ ted by the inadequate correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News dealt a bit more extensively with the phenomenon of the &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; elderly mot@@ ori@@ sts in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older mot@@ ori@@ sts . according to the police , the proportion of elderly mot@@ ori@@ sts who are involved in accidents nationwide , however , is a cause of concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 sen@@ iors were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this equ@@ ates to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of total 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period .
the un@@ named re@@ porter published comments on the light in the article published on Yahoo , showing what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to have against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo about the translation mistake received , among other things , the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is that ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dre@@ ad@@ ful driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So is the translation really bad , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
to translate , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language , which could make translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese .
some companies that do not have foreign employees can still make translations in @-@ house . then the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is rated as the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
the verb@@ ose and enig@@ matic sentences that arise due to machine translation show that this technique is not yet able to replace human translators for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the enig@@ matic im@@ prints which often decorate t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . however , from large corporations or government who have the means to guarantee higher standards , we can expect more thorough translations .
hopefully , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more rep@@ utable source for its translations .
Venezuela : taking protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV were no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also carried out footage of protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organized by opposition groups that opposed the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests began in early April after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court himself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was sn@@ apped and recommended users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# cens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that websites of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offerings such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been reluct@@ ant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ation threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered to @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ etto later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to requests of certain domains .
if an Internet site is blocked by DNS , the server responds incor@@ rectly or refuses to request such a website .
we confirm a DNA lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third sealed channel , the broadcast was dis@@ continued on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera El@@ vis Fl@@ ores , who transferred the protests to Car@@ ac@@ as live , was imprisoned .
Fl@@ ores was beaten , while he was in police custody .
he was released eight hours later , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still available via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multimedia coverage of current events in the country more and more difficult .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ cket as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , Tina fights for children &apos;s rights and collects testim@@ onies of other Cri@@ mes , who became victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report written by Global Vo@@ ices with kindly permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en , &quot; which is edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family living there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation from university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house proudly talking about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one who has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she started working as a cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . when Cri@@ adi@@ tas are called the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is simple : a large family with little money passes her under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another more rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over her head .
however , what is not mentioned is that the children have to pay for innum@@ erable days of house@@ work , which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted .
this practice referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a couple of years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas , especially young girls who were affected by the practice of cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , researched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude which is ino@@ cul@@ ated to the Cri@@ mes guarantees in general silence .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double illusion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family that their daughter in the belief that they complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; can be transferred to another family .
on the other hand , the family who takes up the girl and justi@@ fies its exploitation by faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will experience it many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 , the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon , which is taking place in seclu@@ sion in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín entered the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of severe be@@ atings . shortly thereafter she died .
she was 14 years old .
it was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military personnel of Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Ein@@ wohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra joined Mar@@ ín as long as he suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ cket .
organisations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice of cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go rooted deeply in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no more Carolina &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay could give . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; compla@@ ined Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without paper@@ work , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for swift investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be indic@@ ative - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay comes a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exploited not only as labour force , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the c@@ aribbean , in which her father worked , had to register bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers had to go all the way and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón in Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
in her employer &apos;s house Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
she had to share the time in such a way that she still remained time for learning .
she got up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employers .
Fri@@ days , for example , cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went back home and had time for learning .
the sooner she finished learning , the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited because she had to do dinner for her employers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the master &apos;s library as food from the fridge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she recalls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
at some evenings , the master Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand beside him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; he thought she was intelligent but did not talk to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened as he spoke about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they did not often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would &quot; learn &quot; bad habits &quot; there again . &quot; so they thought that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , belonging to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , would once again speak their mother tongue of Guar@@ an@@ í .
her Lord fear@@ ing that she would lose the education she made possible , she explains .
she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in school , too , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ minated against . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken is mo@@ b@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans who are exposed to the Cri@@ mes when they go to school . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the other children parents have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ cket .
I couldn &apos;t invite anybody to me home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .

the Society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share vac@@ ancies for cleaning staff and girls in Paraguay .
the administration of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter , who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please report to you .
starting from Monday if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad got five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the village Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her phone number .
another woman , who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the author of the advertisement placed himself once again :
dear friends , I have found one . I look to see if it works with her .
thank you , I write again if something is .
the business was completed .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ mean tas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ mes , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history we have managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) , in which the Spanish Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ ani were ens@@ la@@ ved and Spanish in@@ doctr@@ ination , and the system of Mens@@ ú ( in which the workers were taken as semi @-@ slaves ) and the system of Mens@@ ú ( in which the workers were taken as semi @-@ slaves ) , with which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
the social inequality in Paraguay and the display of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian dep@@ uties have recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulating the use and utility of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is accepted by the Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would be established that is mand@@ ated to give citizens permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within six months with the adoption of the law , users should have to register on the website of the site with their correct names and ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it fails to do this , it could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a fine .
the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice , video and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration on users . it is also unclear how they should make up those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to guarantee regulation at the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a user name and password from the ministry of telecommunications &quot; to get through the fire@@ wall that blocked Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . because of those it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network .
but it is not yet known that such plans exist .
experts on the ground are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Technologi@@ sts ( in German &quot; senior research techn@@ ologist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they are forci@@ bly controlling physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court process .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , where control is maxim@@ ized and that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the parliamentary deputy , T@@ amer El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y , proposed legislation against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long prison term was intended for those found guilty to &quot; threaten public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

high up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the north east of Iraq , the animal rights activist H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists of the NGO Nature are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ard .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , that stri@@ ves through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature .
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video states that they have a picture of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in sheer joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a is passion@@ ately fond of a different side of her country , which is not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies for wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .

at the beginning of March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the nor@@ theastern Japan , documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , ts@@ un@@ ami and an atomic accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have caused the disaster .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture was a significant pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring villages of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forci@@ bly evacu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had disappeared entire coastal towns from the map .
in addition , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma &apos;s pre@@ f@@ ecture has had a nuclear accident , already on its own , 160 000 inhabitants have had to leave their homes .
the report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows , from the local point of view , which progress has been reached six years after , in order to rebuild the life of the local residents .

housing construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ( roof@@ ing ) , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i recorded the greatest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . here 80 percent of the planned replacement parts were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such buildings while Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light with 70 percent .
at the same time , even six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated by Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ hab@@ itu@@ i ( on the right hand , kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were to be res@@ ett@@ led into final spare @-@ houses .
after the triple disaster almost 80@@ ,000 people were forced to live in homes .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such homes .
nearly 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated people from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated people who breath@@ ed after disaster were res@@ ett@@ led into final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1,@@ 100 schools affected by mis@@ fortune have opened their gates until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while almost 100 per cent of fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 per cent of fishing ports have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident were heavily affected in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ lands of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot;
tourism has recovered largely in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma continues to decline .
the number of tourists in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate is up to 90 percent on the same level as before . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only have 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coast @-@ inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their living .
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to be able to determine the overall picture , the newspaper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ates .
in her introduction to the article K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to find out more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
as to those who had to be evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacu@@ ated people from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to witness not only the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever had to experience .
out of 160@@ ,000 evacu@@ ated people from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 000 people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , more than 23@@ ,000 people were res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent spare @-@ houses .
according to the state of 2017 , there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home @-@ pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ated ones are older than 50 years old . they are known to reti@@ re right away because the efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are building projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020 .

when people come across from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the similarities .
after a while , however , one often real@@ ises that one more connects than it seems at first glance .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives , and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look closely at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders .

Brazilian activist in the artificial coma after being beaten by the police in nationwide demonstrations

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week to the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia had hit him with a stick against his head . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity measures .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studies social sciences at the federal university of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on him this Saturday and now moved him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás admitted that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from active service until the end of the investigation .
the pictures show the police officers as he hits the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive ward , his face would be shown on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video taken by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the net in which one can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several plum@@ bers briefly ha@@ sten to him .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also di@@ pped in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover some of the costs of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado invites further violent attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás is experiencing a wave of political violence : here , the activist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish has been assass@@ inated by his father because he had sab@@ ot@@ aged the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who is on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a police officer who has hit him with a strike .
police attacks
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where it came to brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , police officers set up rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Pe@@ ac@@ eful Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refrain from violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country .
once again , the Brazilian media has sli@@ pped street protests by directing the focus to another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo talked specifically about a broken glass window in order to create an illustr@@ ative picture of their front pages with a photo .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than the protests of thousands of people who serve to defend a special cause .
this must also be recognised if you are strictly opposed to any form of material damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here too , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate importance , and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
villages forgotten by the de @-@ indu@@ str@@ alization in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane mills in Cuba closed the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the community of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ ab@@ que , is widely known as el Central , Spanish sugar mill , regardless of the fact that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvesting on site .
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane mills were paraly@@ zed .
after the fall , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to invent themselves .
some changed the job .
other res@@ igned and commu@@ te daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who stands up every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east , which are in operation after a long in@@ active period , because they were received .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene seems to have heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane plant would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for concern for the country several decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are not news anymore .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old railway platform of the municipality saw even better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane mills were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they became intol@@ erable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives leading to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; Agricultural perspectives &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly enter history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the shut@@ down of 98 sugar cane mills , more than 65 million people , received their full salary for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he repeated most is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fraud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first closing year , the first letters began to come .
these were officially auth@@ ored documents , which differ@@ ed only in relation to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ an Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was over and the letters became more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane mills that were still being put into operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , awaits the retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory where he helped to build it .
with each part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 years of work .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work@@ load generator was wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the work places and services generated by the plants in the communities in which they found themselves .
we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech of October 21 , 2002 , the President of that time saw in the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane mills
since 2004 sugar cane has been extracted only high by grinding .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the local community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane plant closed , or even better , when they began to gr@@ ind them , they also stopped asp@@ ing the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other companies .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they were spare parts .
without prospects for the future , many young people left the region .
in the area , a food processing plant was created , the production of which serves not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests give the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o a month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a night@@ bearing person , but he does not forgive the lies he told him .

first Nations youths use hip hop to express themselves and preserve their own culture
recording a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photograph used with the permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
young people from First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do it through hip hop , thanks to a series of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the teacher David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked together with ten C@@ ree communities in Montreal and then collabor@@ ated with the C@@ ree hip @-@ hop group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop is going to make the young participants learn topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , engagement , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the core of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia tells , for example , the history of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in western Canada , where almost two dozen indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered .
the cases were mostly not solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation is .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youths did not always dominate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song , the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation is recorded , the chorus is sung on C@@ ree .
the young people involved were given some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ star hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a stop@@ per in the dialect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ script , as well a translation into English , which is translated into German here :
sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me
but I try to keep my days on earth
this is the day when you will take our cry
because we have lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and go forward with our youth as well .
so they can do what they intended for the Creator .
in the comment section , the reader and supporters of the C@@ ree language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contribute and add the line in sy@@ ll@@ ables ( which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( on the shelves ) outside a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan it is possible to see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , are exhibited near the entrance to sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u , &quot; plastic models of the dishes &quot; ) of any food served in this restaurant .
customers will see these plastic dishes and decide whether they will enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry devoted to the production of these plastic dishes .
there are a large number of small companies in the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders has documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them any more . however , a new trend is now turning them into show@@ y mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets .
with Na@@ ver mat@@ ome the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new plastic rib@@ bons decorated with plastic rib@@ bons , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods were transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo station .
the new boom in food supplies is increasingly becoming more complex .
in this case , an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was transformed into a cell phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular dish ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also produced this part for the exhibition in Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and this is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
some mobile support and cell phone designers allow you to create your own work of art . in this case , ik@@ ura or laughing stock is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter che@@ ats ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise colleagues or family members un@@ pleasantly .
our latest mobile stand has the shape of mel@@ ted ice .
in addition , there are also pad@@ dy balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and w@@ rist@@ bands from dried salmon .
further whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal plastic dishes can be viewed at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver mat@@ ome blog post . or follow Twitter on the h@@ ash@@ tag # .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . for example , with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ concep@@ tions and trans@@ lu@@ tions regularly appear only in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings with them .
the report on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the leader of the Sin@@ alo@@ a Cart@@ el , completely forced the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the mour@@ ners or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind every body , behind every bone finding in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never be healed .
for this reason , the Mexican news portal animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; learning with drug trafficking &quot; ) , which aims to give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were caught in the struggle between the law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project like this :
organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how afraid life changes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who looks for secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew on just one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task that we have placed ourselves in search of tom@@ bs , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 , he left the house .
on October 15 , he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training .
there is also my mother , who is here with me too .
at the moment , it has no income .
you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but it does not pay them out , because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where shall we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal , no matter what shape it occurs :
I have been familiar with illness and sensation@@ alism for some years now .
Hi , of course this post is genuinely nice and I have learned lot of things from it on the topic of blo@@ gging . thanks . Od@@ po@@ ve@@ da@@ ť
it brings me out of the compos@@ ure .
sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I can &apos;t be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traffi@@ ckers ) when he is big . and it is not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of offen@@ ders when they walk through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who fear that something has happened to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a stati@@ stic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village is justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rocky &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they don &apos;t stir and stand still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the main district : &quot; how a family has been pl@@ under@@ ed with threats . &quot; it describes how armed criminals each month paid money from their business until they had not only destroyed the business but also tore their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your entire life in just a few days .
the pain of this never passes away , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again if you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers also .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the farther we are from each other , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days whether weeping would dissolve my deeply rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation drawn by violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow up in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , cook potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years ago when he was only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody lar@@ k of his father , who was shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , as a result of organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Council for Public Security and the Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office had 3@@ 103 kill@@ ings . this equ@@ als to average of 8.5 mur@@ ders per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose objective is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trade , which has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ MENT : this entry and the pages to which he links , include images on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to canc@@ eling a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first release , it has been mis@@ guided to photograph trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in terminology from Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures of news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tank truck tra@@ vers@@ ed the village of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tank wagon fell victim to death .
government officials described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ oped dozens of houses including a movie that was full of people looking at the world championships .
houses scattered and char@@ med cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were inc@@ iner@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That is Nigeria &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; by Im@@ g@@ ur user mysti@@ cal Monkey , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident depic@@ t the horrible scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of cl@@ utter@@ ed bodies , which are lined up on the floor while people look at them .
but here history does not end .
over the years , the same photo has been recorded several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened and what happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses dras@@ tically reported atro@@ cities to which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody stayed behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only by using satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated graphi@@ cally .
the reason for the attack was also unclear , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ an and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to gain land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo , as it was wrong@@ ly presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , the ab@@ u@@ sive use of the DR Congo image is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the image was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings .
one more step further , personal comments , such as this example , fal@@ sely bring the picture from the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to provide arguments .
the image of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning detection , published by the United Nations , those who could flee could flee , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following have emerged that brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news site , which in 2012 fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Burma Th@@ an has said that monks and politicians had participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from DR Congo to photograph this information .
the original contribution , which was accessed last April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations called AF@@ P as their source also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ ein his statement , but had not associated the picture from DR Congo .
the global reach of false information
traces of these false coupl@@ ings reach back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse picture search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the said picture from DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ ch of private parties , social media platforms and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed false reports , some have attempted to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have del@@ ine@@ ated examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and linked it to the respective countries on the basis of what they were published on which side they were published . thus , we want to represent the reach more clearly than by language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which were also inter@@ connected in some cases ) , several examples can be used for ab@@ u@@ sive use .
here are some cases that can now be completely sen@@ sed ( on the map in orange ) :
map : news Fr@@ ames .
examples of false coupling of the picture from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to sites or servers that are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or false reports .

as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .

even inside Nigeria , the photo taken from DR Congo was shared as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am bombing in Kan@@ o in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of an ab@@ u@@ sive use of the DR Congo , with a tweet that expresses sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blog , the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being pursued to deli@@ timi@@ ze , since the photos were used impro@@ per@@ ly .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government released a right to judge what they came to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inten@@ tional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with regard to Myanmar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this rec@@ tification , which has appeared exclusively in English , also contains references to counter@@ f@@ eit pictures of rum@@ ors that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operates and used by extrem@@ ist groups to explain that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , which addressed members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly states that the picture of DR Congo NOT shows Muslims killing Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news site fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar granted Th@@ ein his 2012 that monks and politicians had been involved in killing the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture remains in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article of 2014 about students who had been killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the news site An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , published now , has expressly declared that the picture is not from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it portra@@ ys a &quot; similar &quot; jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture later came into circulation in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burning , the world sleeps ) .
the picture of the DR Congo changed , marked with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events , which were presum@@ ed in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times saved ) . but the messages connected with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the goal was to draw attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media reporting in comparison to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussions as this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it false message .
from the embassy in which the picture was taken from DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ tin missionaries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos .
there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
ink Eye points to other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the map in grey ) , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the web craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image data in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which only appeared clearly after the original return of 2010 , the picture ultimately bears a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two powerful themes or frames ( frames ) that go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - in defence of Muslims - the kill@@ ings of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth examining how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
with social media , there are dozens of people who are un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly involved in drinking water around tragedy .
suggests this mood of mis@@ information and mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and ad@@ orn the actual horror of what has actually happened in DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( for example ) .
one argument is that the retention of images of a refusal equ@@ als the tragedy . sometimes these images are even asked by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent imagery can des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and take the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( for example , this study that investig@@ ates how violent media works to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss regarding violent representations in the news media , it is true that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news coverage .
techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake News . &quot; they will have to think carefully about the situation in which a picture may be somewhat sug@@ ary , which can actually be used by the context or completely ab@@ u@@ sive way .
any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how internationally they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo@@ by Andy Sim@@ mons uses according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. confusing ) stri@@ ves to provide language enthusiasts a choice of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words can be found in any language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ cht@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly to every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog , for example , you can find words from the Mw@@ ot@@ sla@@ p language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Take care of your parents in recognition of how they have made an effort in your younger years .
and words in the language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - the convenience or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after you have war@@ med yourself in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog about :
they de@@ fl@@ ate other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page to publish more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these little languages are .
speakers of the Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite spots here .

how Sri Lanka deals with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and flood disaster in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually ends at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya spread over the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
after a statement from the Sri Lanka &apos;s disaster center on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly 100 people were missing because of the floods and slu@@ dge winds .
more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people have been brought to 30@@ 4 safe locations .
the rainf@@ alls were closed on Saturday ( 27 May ) and the water levels in some areas slowly decreased .
health and hygiene conditions of the population are a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama City with water distances of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates on the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods exac@@ erb@@ ate the Den@@ gue fever crisis , Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on the way .
this morning the N@@ elu@@ wa bus stood in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded due to the water level of Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a , which occurred yesterday .
the Air Force has provided five planes for rescue operations and further five are made to transport emergency supplies to the inhabitants included in their flooded villages .
various organizations and startups have also been preparing to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call + 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the cad@@ ence data center will be informed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flood relief &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle for picking up assistance and donations . they were then rel@@ a@@ yed to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; key which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people trapped by floods and land@@ slides .
the united efforts of the Government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents in need of security and contribute to aid measures .
this has prevented the loss of other lives , and Sri Lanka &apos;s population is now the long way to restore normal@@ cy .

the Women &apos;s March will be held in San Francisco on January 21 , 2017 .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love girlfriend .
I trust you my four year old daughter , she tru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in the one minute we are still calling slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next election , we are voting rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf high , bound from an American flag , others chant slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that has built up in their imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have ab@@ domin@@ ated me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look alike .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim in different kinds . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , like I do not fit in , are being dispos@@ ed of .
to be ab@@ used
I &apos;m not alone .
this is even happening to the poet , whose poetry is mostly sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what kind of images do you think when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran , and Prophet Muhammad were to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the Western imagination , religion was er@@ ased by Rum@@ is , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another is in the ad@@ duc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this enti@@ cing imagery is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the landmark Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid de@@ compos@@ es the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these images still prot@@ ru@@ de today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to perpet@@ u@@ ate them .
I &apos;ve been working in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen these powerful , fla@@ wed nar@@ rati@@ ves dominate our news@@ feed .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that has led to nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative fails to recognize that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and forcing Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women to cover their entire body , these are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers on American ground were spoken by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this narrative has occupied our collective imagination as deeply and incor@@ rectly that often Sik@@ h men and children become the target of anti @-@ militar@@ ist attacks and har@@ ass@@ ings .
because of these stories that we tell and due to the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is today not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to the 1,7 billion belong
in the news industry , we do more than just tell stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rati@@ ves that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of the 1.7 billion people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims constitute the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ American citizens .
six out of ten American Muslims are among the first generation immigrants coming from 77 different countries .

four decades ago , my immig@@ rant parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue , and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time , when Khan re@@ invented the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ true Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a Muslim and American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of bringing out my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chiefs that all Muslims carry with them - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ est , we do not carry all hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also don &apos;t have to be a theological expert to be a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to almost always be chosen for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim milit@@ ants and inter@@ religious activists trying to combat widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islamic skill machine with credi@@ tors , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information that our already fla@@ wed picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
due to the stories we tell and due to the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a stranger who is tear@@ ing up a woman &apos;s head@@ sc@@ arf .
or as the frigh@@ tening map of attacks on mos@@ ques across the USA , see below .

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ugly forms attacks our belonging .
it attacks our identity , which is so extensive , so versatile and multi @-@ faceted that it cannot fit into a drawer .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as Muslims , but being a Muslim first was born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they refer to the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging .
my Muslim belief and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , my rock in the surf see that I am Muslims when she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our homes .
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter when I held her in my arms , and she whis@@ pered the Arabic verses to the protection that seals the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim nationality is always part of my shadow .

belonging to this is the image of my grandmother on my mother@@ ly side with her sisters , as she gained a competition in the art of floral arrangements in Kar@@ achi for decades .
it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings painted Su@@ fi @-@ Hei@@ liger ; and an Koran with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
being Muslims means speaking the prayers they told me when I had a bad day .
being Muslim is how she taught me to relate to God : God Mi@@ an , which means God , my only Lord .
for a people who - for centuries - have been col@@ oni@@ alized by an &quot; empire &quot; that created a company with the name of the Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tian ine@@ di@@ stic company , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord .

belonging means growing up and hearing that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my grandfather we@@ eps grandfather .
in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an appe@@ aled to his family in India dominated by K@@ ash@@ mir , a family that he could not close to his arms in half a century .
belonging to it is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk .
to be Muslims means to know that in the past two centuries Europeans have &quot; col@@ oni@@ alised &quot; all up to four Muslim lands .
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was cast off over a Muslim country a century ago .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mir subject of the British Empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mosque in England .
before there were planes , he traveled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

it means remembering that fourteen years ago , the migh@@ ti@@ est military in the world , with troops spread across every continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the w@@ reck@@ age of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that if a tragedy hits the US and the suspect carries a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liberated black slave .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this land .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim , and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple hy@@ ph@@ ens , but fail to communicate it to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion holds more possibilities than a cube of magic , but is represented in the redu@@ ci@@ ble doubt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
being a mother means caring for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged individuals build structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in Muslim registr@@ ations that began with President Bush and extended under President Obama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a country that closes its borders towards people from just the countries who are being bombar@@ ded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is largely targeted by Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars we lead and the bombs we throw away on Muslim lands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically in@@ accurate picture and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep to sof@@ ten the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are back decades of recognizing the roots of our fears and the faulty and dangerous bil@@ l@@ ness we have in our news auctions .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ Feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Muslim Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .

col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global point in which we are in .
and this moment has consequences beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason for conspiracy the@@ ori@@ sts who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now lead the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
they had not yet given them a few years before ; now they are ruling large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the story I was not aware of when I was so old , as it is now my daughter , but who made me today a dis@@ connected Muslim .
things I have left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b in my speech .
things that may aw@@ aken memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that character@@ ize our humanity may l@@ ur@@ k a story where someone is made to a &quot; other . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations take place within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are no terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are being led and people are embra@@ ced by creating the &quot; other &quot; in public perception , four decades ago even scientist of Stan@@ ford .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions after the role of it , consciously and un@@ consciously to soli@@ di@@ fy the &quot; others . &quot; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , the chocolate cake eaten while he already bom@@ bed countries and &quot; to other made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity
telling stories , by Fli@@ ck@@ r users Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the un@@ en@@ for@@ ce@@ able blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk of small and not very small languages will not be passed on to the children born there .
for the creators of the project the following applies :
the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that assume diversity - secure spaces where people don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while listening is often associated with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to , feel , touch &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers present their history first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their dedication and representation make sure that the audience re@@ alizes .
they cry out laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of Daf@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate is also sei@@ zing the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ uses ara tells the story of the har@@ es and bab@@ o@@ ons in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the meaning of his be@@ ak , John Ny@@ am@@ uses ara asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is this to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a broad smile , he shares his feeling of inclu@@ siveness : &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend this . anyone who is inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story narrative guides .
Puerto Rico calls for US re @-@ fixing of public debt
with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounts to 72 million US dollars , several religious and civil organizations participated in a mass demonstration last 3 April 2017 ; the march started at the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ a Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( citizen front for the ne@@ ural examination of debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical congregation of Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of re@@ fixing the debts have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people Puerto Rico demands that politicians , bank@@ ers and government authorities who are responsible for debts are accoun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand a financial review and an executive committee without personal interests at public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding remuneration , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pressed and oppressed .
the people Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to deal with sin@@ king pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not into the US sovereign territory - suffers from a serious financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; an independent non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; measures imposed on the outside will be je@@ op@@ ardis@@ ed without the participation and conviction of citizens to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration bore the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night watch for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and commemor@@ ate the contributions he has done for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture , hosted in Berlin , hosted an event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of Book S@@ prints , produces excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The costs of freedom : collective research ) .
the book published last year and available here roy@@ alty @-@ free contains a number of essays that deal with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it says :
this book aims to discuss how to build movements for free knowledge and what the real costs are with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the Movement for Free Knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feed and to create some sense from our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was taken out of the directory of the A@@ dra prison where he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introductory part of his book titled &quot; Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce &quot; gives his friends and family a voice that push@@ es for his release and wants to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly .
seeing how Bass@@ el is paying a high price for his participation in a free culture has led many of us to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of periodi@@ cally extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown location .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; military police Bass@@ el had taken part in A@@ dra on the basis of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; command from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that on 12 November 2015 , she was contacted by persons who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
however , his place of residence and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently passes the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ que &apos;s cultural prototypes was more pro@@ fan@@ e than the work he started with a group of arch@@ e@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of numerous civi@@ lizations and here f@@ use Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , Bass@@ el did not know that ten years after working with this work , the IS would do everything to extingu@@ ish this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Syria but the world .
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life with dreaming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhelmed when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was in jail .
I have learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a commission which she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for a year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the texts to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic to English .
the book is available free of license .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book by Nor@@ a entitled &quot; It happens &quot; :
it happens every time you visit ,
that I sink into the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace ,
that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
I forget the prison &apos;s thr@@ ong
and I would go into every detail of your voice and words
that I bear with passion with me ,
when your eyes say goodbye
and I let another piece of my soul leave with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to rec@@ laim all the moments ,
and to cry and smile over your absence .
I testify to myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the detention of Bass@@ el G@@ haz@@ i wrote :
one year goes by , my soul
during the stay
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of monsters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; making history is not unique in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the protests in 2011 against Assad &apos;s Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tortured or even executed .
until 2016 , according to the international human rights organization Am@@ nesty International , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in jail since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mozambique : s &amp; D vice @-@ president for corruption charges again on previous post
Mos@@ ambique re@@ acted with anger at a corruption case where a government member returned after half of his prison sentence to the workplace in the state machine where corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 together with four other def@@ endants for em@@ be@@ zz@@ lement of 54 million me@@ tic@@ als ( about 800 000 euros ) .
the money came from public funds of Mozambique &apos;s airports , whose advice was Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for its re @-@ adjustment to the company , which happened on 19 April .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic which rejected the request , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to his old post as the company did not carry out disciplinary proceedings after his arrest .
however , many inhabitants do not call the action good .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , in an interview with Deutsche Welle strongly condemned the decision of the company to re@@ position the Director :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in terms of the efforts of our legal system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company ought to have initiated a disciplinary proceedings against the contrary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the company apparently remained silent and did not take appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent guy , he would be a consultant , after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them served .
he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent he has agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company he helped to cause harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
ref@@ ly !
bit@@ one Vi@@ age , a young Muslim and student of political science in Brazil , says the director has no moral :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him . I cannot believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already so massi@@ vely insul@@ ted the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks mor@@ als to return and serve the state , * he had already a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead served himself by the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as though it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself was tired of this man who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and eventually sentenced to a long prison term .
to be honest , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief belongs to the prison : &quot; &quot; &quot;
thi@@ eves belong to Sam@@ ora Mak@@ el &apos;s prison not only to be remembered as the first independent President , but also as sharp , sharp @-@ ed@@ ged and - incidentally , proph@@ etic speaker .
one of his most famous oral representations was when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious person is capable of selling even the Fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambitions , his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not like that . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambitions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious person is at the same time criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , and he was 10 years old and was released .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or divi@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts out of the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origins of the word are still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dating &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely de@@ fle@@ cted con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be associated with racism today , but the word itself does not automatically generate hate speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that posts where they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about their use have been cens@@ ored .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , Bur@@ m@@ ese chair is also written &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ dy A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; like this :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because it contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a p@@ un .
the phrase ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that she will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook needs to be more analy@@ tic before it extingu@@ ishes all posts that are suspected of spreading racism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook does not delete the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; manually . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Fac@@ t@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the next words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who propag@@ ate hate speech have received quite a good lesson .
now it is time to cut off its nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who propag@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of cat@@ ch@@ words is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks will simply start using a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new policy of Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to copy , post and share content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; didn &apos;t meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post has been removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his opinion of why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ in believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community for advice :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intent to reduce racism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stools &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not attempt to correct the wrong@@ ly deleted posts .
if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits that gave them a big turnover , that would be great .
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship has caused a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and deliberately write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the web .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that did not contain hate speech , but were removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nationalist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to bro@@ aden their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks is supposed to increase violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine region , where conflict between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to bring out the ramp@@ ant hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked better , rather in context than on code focused initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago concludes with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law that should ban this practice , so that the age @-@ capable age is now at 18 .
prior to this amend@@ ment of the marriage law , some members of Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities had adher@@ ed to practice , and in May 2016 there came to a great public out@@ cry . at that time , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere because that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this occurred despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defined every person under 18 years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children already married to 15 in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married between 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements that were eager to abol@@ ish laws on children &apos;s marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result .
however , everything went smoothly .
a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no hes@@ itation to say to the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should , condemned to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really complicated matter , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill at all .
but in early 2017 , the bill was decided against child marriage - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country must agree and let the law be announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators posted a status update on Facebook , which re@@ posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : bill against child marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and not a single one against it .
having previously been decided by the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of social media users were enthusiastic because the laws on children &apos;s marriage had finally been changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who suffers a minist@@ erial post in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk , which has disgu@@ ised the core of the thing , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth almost every price .
while Abel was of the opinion , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ eu@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al - Thomas , which says : , , Excell@@ ent news !
the marriage law has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for this - 0 on the other hand ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the age of marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft on the amend@@ ment of the marriage law was decided today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 members in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present during the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all Members of Parliament voted against the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
children &apos;s marriage is no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ birth control @-@ use .
many thanks to all the activists who fought him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our dep@@ uties .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of satellite Mahar@@ aj , the general secretary of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the country &apos;s most famous Hind@@ u organization .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take legal steps , the law should be passed , and he seems to make his promise now .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ dent of the law , said that if Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wanted to approach the debate on the subject .
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
rather Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so generally , in a way that only panic and un@@ ease can provoke , if we , instead of speaking of the problem that we , would be used to abuse the state in our bedroom , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where children are legally or still the norm in various gra@@ dations , although there are laws that they prohi@@ bit .

on Sunday , the Office of the Public Prosecutor announced Y@@ ar@@ News the local news service that they were h@@ acked .
through the mirr@@ oring of web pages , Turkish users can see Wikipedia as a source of Wikipedia
the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States , internationally dark@@ ened .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
since more than a month , Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day by day , it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share useful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking .
although many tech sav@@ vy Internet users are used to using conversion tools for blocked web pages ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third biggest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been writing articles from Wikipedia , as described recently in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the internet have been held since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to be locked , several M@@ irr@@ or@@ Pages ( pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) are now di@@ pped .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform put all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. machine computer connections ) , which does not support the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the content is however voc@@ able despite legal prohibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after listening to the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put all the sn@@ apshots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read the content in a distributed and distributed way .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia articles even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org .
IP@@ FS also admitted that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has produced both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a M@@ irr@@ or@@ Page of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar M@@ irr@@ or@@ pages when locked in the respective country Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member as well as employees at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , a mirror .
you access a different URL that is not the original . that which you can see is from Wikipedia .
in essence , the server further direc@@ ts the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey .
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were bl@@ urred with badly positioned motifs and balanced colors .
this motivated him to take a camera and try to straigh@@ ten the situation .
back then he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nepal &apos;s wildlife to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown , next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class location helps him in his work :
I live at the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River a le@@ op@@ ard would be .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to kne@@ el pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and wants to deep@@ en the understanding of the fact that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he ought to know &#91; it &#93; , for he stood before Tig@@ ers before face to face , saying ,
a tiger can &apos;t be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep when sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the King of the Bu@@ st@@ les appeared . he immediately sat down , we looked at us and he star@@ es through the S@@ al trees ! !
&quot; &quot; &quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I click for conservation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to make pictures of vi@@ pers in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could take pictures of a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation .
take a look at some of these photos below .

this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ anch@@ a and originally appeared on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
many parts of India avoid women with the utmost care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that due to social pressure they respect the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences they should desp@@ ise the norm , to preserve this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a pseudo @-@ court and rejected by her family and the village community after having appe@@ aled to a married relative with her name .
the tradition of their wives also is not to be called by the name , is widespread among men too . however , they have far less rebu@@ kes to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , came to a unique club and became the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of # K@@ hel@@ bad@@ al &apos;s campaign , which is operated by the Community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and is committed to the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to expose practices such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and leads these clubs .
it reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion round was of women who did not mention their hus@@ bands at the name .
she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women can easily identify themselves .
not to speak lou@@ dly to the names of their hus@@ bands is a custom that they all have to maintain and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini believes :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not stop this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband on the name , wanted to try out at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said that I should call him now by his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first deb@@ ating club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patriarch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed it was a good thing because it meant that younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the names of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they want , does it mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equal ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women could never speak out the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that she could only kiss in front of herself during the whole exercise ; another decided to release the complete fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the adren@@ alin rush about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands at home .
and they kept their word .
in the following days Roh@@ ini received numerous reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put into her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead that indicates marriage :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ od red dot if he did it too .
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing it .
the other women have not stopped completely , but think they are now in a better position to choose to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip to every deb@@ ating club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say some things lou@@ dly , no matter how small they occur .
in a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to clothing .
some women in the group have only carried sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most people this is okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ m @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pair of trousers ; they didn &apos;t dare .
after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code , morality connected with sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled their own couple of cur@@ ri@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round , so that the women could carry them .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will manage it .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly :
we have made only small steps so far .
some women rehear@@ sed it a few times , but then stopped telling her husband &apos;s name .
some , including me , make it even more , but only if they are alone and do not have other members of the family .
only one or two continue to say the names of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like hag@@ gling over more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a sacrifice of the patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on the 29th of June this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was held in the Japanese Twitter @-@ Trend , where many fans shared memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as the turn@@ around in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who was exclusively interviewed by the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , noted in 2016 on the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just about five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
it became clear to the people here that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today is the Beat@@ les commem@@ oration day in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also today songs are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese kar@@ a@@ oke bars and in English teaching at Japanese secondary schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today the Day of Beat@@ les is commemor@@ ative .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doll should be John L@@ enn@@ on or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the famous places related to the band .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you absolutely must visit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From Link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be cur@@ ri@@ le enough :
good morning together .
today the Day of Beat@@ les is commemor@@ ative .
just in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across the Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
and of course some companies also exploit the fan base in terms of market terms , such as this R@@ amen Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! , today is the Beat@@ les commemor@@ ative day .
and what could this be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; today I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how the day is going to proceed .
so , we hope that you are with us !
&quot; &quot; &quot; follow the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ash@@ tag &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to find out more about the Beat@@ les commemor@@ ative day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
gl@@ are @-@ headed men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the population that gl@@ aring men could be in Mozambique &apos;s target of attacks .

a new system of ab@@ duction of bald persons for organ trafficking , presumably for dis@@ believers , is worried by the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and some of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently they conf@@ essed that the bodies of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are used .
the police spokesman of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC declared that the head of a man of a bald man could bring gold or bring wealth .
it is the first time that successive attacks on men of bald men were registered in Mozambique .
another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 carried out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique are target of ritual attacks , warned the Muslim police following the latest kill@@ ings of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police are already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and assassination of bald @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , for supposedly un@@ believing rituals , has given cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , this also attracts the police of the Republic of Mozambique in bet@@ tered ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith exists according to which the victims in the head might have power , the wealth generation .
in recent days , three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country .
on Facebook , Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the blog@@ gers &apos; poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique :
I AM IN GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambique , THE S@@ ME fo@@ ams A country in which people would have shame to go to the streets , to offer sex against good marks , and to take sex against good marks , and to take their lives to earn their bread , a country where neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or gl@@ are @-@ headed for dis@@ believing purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; are hun@@ ted that aim to attain fast riches .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humour .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter land@@ lady , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the district Mor@@ t@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ek , as well as the police spokesman Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , both are very young :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mozambique &apos;s authorities are very concerned about the m@@ ord@@ ances of sli@@ pper@@ y people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) plays a key role in expanding public access to Internet and Open Knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting of Arabic blog@@ gers in 2009 .
in November 2015 Bas@@ que &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by persons who are themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad administration .
they reported that their husband had been sentenced to death , but gave no further information .
Bas@@ tille &apos;s stay and constitution remained unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we are especially proud of the creativity of Bass@@ el as a pioneer of the open web movement .
and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organizations that have been campaig@@ ning for their release in the last five years .
since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , such as the Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested by the regime or forci@@ bly disappeared are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .

free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) Neu@@ n reactions from the international community for medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably just recently made .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version is published under a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer at the end of June .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( endanger@@ ing the state ) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that demanded democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal affair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and told a spokesman that he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China still receives calls from the international community , Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release or permit him treatment abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out .
Hong Kong Free Press has compiled some reactions from abroad .
unified nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
a spokesman , however , refused to comment whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to permit treatment to Li@@ u abroad .
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that it would ultimately have nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon in China , as exports have largely been blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a resolution on which China was asked to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ us as she announced in an explanation on June 30 :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all the restrictions of Mr. Li@@ u &apos;s wife as well as family members .
they are to meet and receive all visits that they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad announced that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him to have the opportunity to treat abroad in so far as he can help him with his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on 27 June that the Embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the call of the US embassy moved a fur@@ ious response from China , with the foreign ministry &apos;s statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley told China that China should offer the following :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , on which they claim according to the Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I urge China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that he can go into a proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany and the United Kingdom
&quot; &quot; &quot; German spokesman Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing &apos;s news agency Reuters that China had great concerns whether the hu@@ stle and bustle around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada in the United States
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um requested to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to be cared for by his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer previously told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside , including his lawyers .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and allowing them to per@@ sist in exercising these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
France and France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry requested China to release Li@@ u on 29 June to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments he needs , regardless of where . furthermore , his wife and family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France info already reported that the French government would welcome the Li@@ u government in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information about whether France will eventually take it up .
Taiwan International Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of national affairs in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance for those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the ill @-@ intellectual li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama and the Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , expressed himself very much in a statement on 28 June around Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives it took and for which it was strictly punished would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 that stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ iden , Singapore should be considered a city .
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
during the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he supported Singapore as a city .
... no one has asked whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; twist logic &quot; in order to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious country , we can say that we are not a country at all .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries &quot; in view of this , he seemed inevitably un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently run by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core point of the topic , the good old ly@@ re shows up from author@@ itarian rulers who pret@@ end to be Democrats , abandoned the twisted logic as it fits better to their power .
in the end the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam was given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ciary , our political system , really non @-@ answers .
he tar@@ n@@ ished the corresponding questions with non @-@ answers of ration@@ ale kind .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam to express his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to what country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam would take the effort to clarify this point , provided that he was paid highly to be part of the City Government &apos;s government .
by publishing his comment on the blog , he points out to the critics that it is necessary to begin reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that you can better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said Singapore was more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections are so un@@ even , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said Singapore was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ iden , who as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very confused about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said , very embarrass@@ ed ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ iden , member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes that really , and is aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review outlines the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ iden &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; believe a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we will only be considered an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , what country are the sovereign rights of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam are of grave importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , do they defend their city but not their country ?
who must our Prime Minister pay back to invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink HR card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
, the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade joins the Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore and has always been a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proposition seems to have anno@@ yed many Singap@@ ur@@ ans ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country above all &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should talk more about the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked its editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or homeland ?
your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series that will expose ru@@ mo@@ urs about certain parts of the world and a different fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question that is most asked me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I answer . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan .
depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Canadi@@ ans maybe cook in@@ war@@ dly against anger when they are held for Americans but that doesn &apos;t bother me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that Canadi@@ ans distinguish us from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans put a Canadian flag on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all lovers of Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and 9 / 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried little map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends that I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , being called &quot; nice , &quot; basically means to be sk@@ e@@ wed - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has his own Canadian bi@@ ker ) .
if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harmless means to be in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not deserve attention .
this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go so far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Canadian .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; might be just cool pol@@ it@@ eness . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence across the fence .
we lack the warm , open @-@ hearted friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau asked the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ ert Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
a pop @-@ band that is famous in Thailand has released a music video that par@@ o@@ des the Jun@@ ta , which in 2014 seized power and , despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to reign .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about what regulations his girlfriend does .
although not expressly political , the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to the song was a huge success .
only within the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially to the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these videos of the video that relate to some of the political issues that Thailand persi@@ sted in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may relate to the dra@@ con@@ ic section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives the supreme commander of the army absolute decision @-@ making on important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th Ru@@ le : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your mind@@ set &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change the settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people viewed by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army that monitors online content and prosec@@ utes persons accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thailand relies heavily on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Maj@@ estic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
one of the problems the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , even though security experts warn them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of taxes .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van , before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison because they supposedly have caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band who imported the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the 2014 protests .
life continues in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ ch@@ asia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society only recovered very slowly in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
more than 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ chas@@ m war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ po@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ carbon basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Central Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most of the Russians live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ ch@@ sia .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district has been 16@@ ,000 , after barely risen for over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this area .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey apartment blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s which are called Chr@@ u@@ ch@@ uk@@ ho@@ v@@ ka are symbolic for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are deca@@ yed and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local elder man .
he starts talking and it is hard for him to finish this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all serving the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union have meanwhile left the district .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ chen@@ ow@@ ka , which houses one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in my hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to let ourselves be photographed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl is whis@@ per@@ ing something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal consumption ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable farming .
it is difficult to come across the laps .
in winter , the District Administration provides free candles and bread to the villages .

about ten years ago an older woman called Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her oldest daughter living in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will always remain in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she instead supports her young grand@@ children .
Gal@@ ina monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t have a vegetable garden or house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit ourselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; she calls her unt G@@ aly@@ a . &quot; they said we could plant zu@@ cch@@ ini .

G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s convers@@ ational partner Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ asha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they remember the village life before the war .
despite the relatives who live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ ch@@ asia just broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right for them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation comes to an end , a little boy runs past us .

a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses migrants on their long journey &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border from Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and appears here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink spectacle frame and golden earrings in ted@@ dy bear form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel but hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian immigrants come here .
sometimes , says Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people are coming in full mini@@ buses and from the top of the coast they begin to cry : &quot; Mama Africa !
&quot; &quot; &quot; where are you Mama Africa ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also been sleeping outside on boxes .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick , they buy them drugs that they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently .
I asked him if M@@ um Africa is an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a mou@@ sta@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her , as African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very aff@@ ection@@ ate .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together and that Afri@@ cans already speak to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will contact Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests often send her text messages when they are gone to greet her or to report her about the course of her trip .
she explains that her Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a blind alley leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have recorded migrants in their small house .
it is polic@@ eman and found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive .
he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they experience .
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after he lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children , who wanted to squee@@ ze money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single parent , offered him her roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests again .
in the passages , travelers calm@@ ly consult their phones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most of them from Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but it is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who went away .
like a proud grandmother she fl@@ atten@@ s in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair @-@ spots you made an Kun@@ din , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she puts her in front of me .

a check point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang by Twitter users to make the best possible .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan District of U@@ rum@@ qi received a mobile phone message indicating the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the announcement , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the authorities should also use the app for more than fighting terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because , shortly after they had installed the app , they exchanged news with a private We@@ Chat group .
in the communication of the police , the app was able to identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and to remotely control their home network .
this App for min@@ ors will help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate a person &apos;s home network or steal them from it .
this introduction is consistent with other measures to monitor the digital activities in this region .
while messages about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those living in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs .
the Media Out@@ let , based on Twitter , &quot; images from mainland China , &quot; published cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen checked the inhabitants indi@@ scri@@ min@@ ately whether they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification requires people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices intended for elderly people .
this is a form of imprisonment by rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , which highlights that the software can up@@ lift the requirement of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer .
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and cell phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang are transformed into electron@@ ical hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the spread of illegal content .
all branches of government , government and affiliated organizations , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office when operating their computers and communication devices .
a recent Freedom House report , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published an order in a district of U@@ rum@@ qi in a district of the regional capital of U@@ rum@@ qi up to 1 August to register their &quot; personal ID cards , cell phones , external drives , portable hard disks , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrorist videos &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of U@@ rum@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible violations , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sleep or death , Part 1 : all cries after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which activist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and discover that you are alone in a place where everything has van@@ ished .
everything has gradually dissip@@ ated and revealed a truth which is clearly identifiable , both internally and extern@@ ally .
one that hon@@ ors all glory to her name .
one that has struck down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but when reality catches you and you look behind the scenes - beyond acting , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and all cries after death .
all doubt dissolve in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even when the Earth moves on the axis of the Un@@ hei@@ ls . it becomes clear to you that you are trapped here between the walls that your parents , and in front of them your grand@@ parents , stone built around stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security service provided it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five teenagers were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest , such as we@@ eds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to break the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the districts cov@@ eted , only my own .
for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I had no high demands on a city which is stuffed up into the arter@@ ies with state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art safety organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had a bit cal@@ ming after the power supply had stopped in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I interrupted the silence by shou@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several times from my roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice contradic@@ ted by silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt bold enough to get together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we united to a glorious picture that fulfilled my expectations .
in such a moment , you are aware that you release the spirit from the lamp , but it simply isn &apos;t interested in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed all the way up to the office of the security service from the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to talk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear you scre@@ aming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are only brave enough to shout when we &apos;re not close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you are tru@@ sting what to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I was standing in front of this building .
perhaps it was about my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity , perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure about my thing when I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped to look at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest possible conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I repent not of what I have said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in solitary confin@@ ement and his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right away from his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed sentence is still in my nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I was exposed for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with myself .
then again through the yard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I received all the details exactly before I was in charge of the room .
otherwise they have probably allocated to me a larger cell this time .
I have to share them with just one more prisoner and may immediately put me in , without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old @-@ tried communication method : beating the fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cellular com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first resp@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation , he answered me ultimately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; apparently there was none of the surrounding cells of an este@@ emed middle @-@ aged man , who looks similar to me and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doctor &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in perfect darkness I can &apos;t see any distinctive facial features , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all numbers only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would leave him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to ch@@ ase all these cro@@ ws that lab@@ elled on the fruits in the garden of my head .
from the distance I always hear them scre@@ aming &quot; Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cries are ring@@ ing every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that the horror in person presented to us : the wheel ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; allu@@ ding to the 13th string of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was lifted : to protect the state security against us and prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - thus they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail card and betra@@ yed the narrow view of their world view .
this is not a house here , which is not a land here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero .
I took care of the listening room and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he catches a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join these da@@ ys@@ ses and protest at demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it , not to answer .
I can &apos;t say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
some voice told me that I had to get used to punishment , even though I had done nothing to make this penalty .
a punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he calls the lovingly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the toilet .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you can &apos;t measure yourself with him and you can &apos;t hold back your scre@@ ams .
my scre@@ ams were not enough for him , so they exchanged the tube through a cable .
during my first arrest , I wondered if the investig@@ ator used to work as a garbage collector or whether it belonged to the normal working equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four wires in order to present us , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable .
within a single hour , three of them changed , while I was still in line .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er re@@ marked the cooling and didn &apos;t take any pleasure in it , which is why he attacked an electri@@ cally charged rod .
electricity went through my entire body , enough to supply my whole district .
my semi @-@ naked body stretched out on the floor was the perfect conductor .
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he ruled that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed , which came to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must worry fear@@ fully . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and keep you , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always left me free .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b spends most of his time indoors , sometimes he dri@@ lls to his screen , sometimes to his computer , and back to his couch .
but what one can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his lips spotted with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family was forced to escape from their village in Palestine in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : farmers ) .
for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activist confronted by the conservative majority and questioned their old @-@ established views on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape .
with his music , which often deals with themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown Am@@ man , but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his mind , and he can sympath@@ ise with the people suffering from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he doesn &apos;t admit it openly , he won a special dis@@ like against U.S. foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those trying to survive in war zones has anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation &quot; - that is what he calls himself , even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so , because I &apos;m a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he poured out Nes@@ café in water in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically the sli@@ ps speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the swa@@ ths of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially if you have a look at the neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan to drink water - in order not to land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry announced a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual front@@ man Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the country &apos;s cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert forecast .
the MP and former press spokesperson in the Islamic coalition of Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert had been cancelled &quot; just &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the singer .
many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which asks the well @-@ tried legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes throughout the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimates the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to opt for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement probably should not be simply a shallow rhet@@ oric , but rather reflects an increasingly clear @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b resi@@ ded traditional sex organs by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently tram@@ pled unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they really should trust .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , the number of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honour kill@@ ings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has increased in Jordan - un@@ official extern@@ ally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of volunteers in 2016 reached its peak ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to a crime against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be detained in prison in@@ definitely &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and for their release many years of bureaucratic expenditure and guarantee by the family are necessary that the woman will not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is well known for not shy away from topics that are long considered tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but acknow@@ le@@ dges that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit allu@@ sions to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was in@@ doctr@@ inated by politics , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b tac@@ kles the question of Palestinian identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated remarkably often :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one , in his words , &quot; can get what you want &quot; - be it belief or un@@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notes that hardly anyone talks in Jordan about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans , and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b interviewed Ro@@ ya &apos;s popular j@@ ord@@ an online program to remember that his comments were torn out of context , distorted and cens@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but stre@@ amed was only a processed version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today H@@ da@@ i@@ b adver@@ ti@@ ses the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and believes intoler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who is still remembered today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ die , who was to work later on behalf of the cali@@ phs , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert has been cancelled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom it is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service held several former members of the Association and members of the Te@@ ach@@ ers Association , stating that they were critically addressing the problems associated with the corruption in the country .
in view of this , the concert H@@ da@@ i@@ bs opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
Jordan has prevented M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that &apos;s H@@ da@@ i@@ b - is made up of slow , thou@@ ghtful and internal changes . it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience it . &quot;
perhaps the region will be approached with the help of music , art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , cluster mun@@ itions and artificial types of demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least , he hopes that .
until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and therefore also resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or dolls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
one assumes that it is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in many parts of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us in August . another theory states that the for@@ ts , drums and dancing have been delivered over a thousand years and come from a time when armies of western Japan mar@@ ched into the north @-@ east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to snap some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can hardly imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ yo@@ en for a long time now : two for@@ ts are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

outside appearances and personal care were seldom as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crimin@@ ality and promote legitimate jobs like the hair@@ dres@@ ser .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s main port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic centre of the capital Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street rob@@ bery and illegal drug trafficking are common@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other medi@@ um@@ - and South American countries - experienced an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the out@@ lan@@ dish hair@@ styles of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) has led to the fact that more and more regular citizens get into the hands of hair@@ d@@ ress@@ ers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the hair@@ d@@ ress@@ ers &quot; competition &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there experts confront each other in order to show who of them can create the ec@@ centric looks as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current cont@@ ests are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of bad advice a training in the hair@@ dres@@ ser &apos;s art that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and opportunities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 , we were the only school in the municipality and the district , where we are very proud , because out of love for the children we have built this educational community .

the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write letters of love to people we know ?
isn &apos;t it much more important to accommodate people who feel pushed out ?
it was precisely this question that the young Colom@@ bian activist Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os was no longer head of the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired her to the Cart@@ as p@@ or la @-@ li@@ ación campaign , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ rilla fighters .
it was only recently that their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their share : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace treaty with the F@@ ARC guer@@ rilla movement , which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
internationally , the signing of the peace contract was so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for its mer@@ its .
but before the Colom@@ bian people there is still a long way to talk about genuine reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ ll@@ as , who lived in illegal camps for many years , were subjected to war rhet@@ oric and carried their arms around the clock , must now be able to integrate themselves into the lives of civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of profound hatred towards guer@@ rilla fighters , must now take in their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans had to join and help with the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guer@@ rilla fighters to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ rilla fighter - who will then be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the Let@@ ters to Recon@@ ci@@ liation was born at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to talk briefly to K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love , but forget those who need them much more unnecessary .
he plan , he further told us to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent response .
so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now find their place in society and have to build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace . &quot;
to date , more than 2,000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca on March 19 .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp to personally over@@ haul the letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC presented themselves as they had done before to accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between , &quot; said the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of the guer@@ illa fighters .
when I saw one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ rilla fighters live ) I saw a guer@@ illa fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go , because beside him on the bed was a M@@ GL pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I still spoke to him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never before in my life someone wrote something so beautiful , so I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then suddenly tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him completely and sat down beside the gr@@ en@@ ade laun@@ cher .
perhaps he was sorry for the war , it was a pity for all the years to be the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought that anyone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside there waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
for the first time , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to form a panel discussion .
the students were all grown up as already a war and the F@@ ARC was already acting in secret .
that is why the F@@ ARC leaders declared the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice done by the State to the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to making society more equ@@ itable in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
hearing these people who had never heard hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hated people with beautiful feelings , who were turned around by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comfor@@ ts me that all people - including those who have killed and have done so much harm , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters responded to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the Colom@@ bi@@ ans were prophes@@ ied that after dis@@ ar@@ ming , peace would reign .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to resort to arms , to stand up and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC now focus on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .
a Trans@@ woman talks about the persec@@ utions in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and the life before Kad@@ y@@ row

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ h@@ owa and its first publication on the website OC Media .
homosexu@@ als and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of hazards - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with terror activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that hangs like a ladies compla@@ ining about the LGB@@ T@@ Q community there has not been created overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the republic .
the LGB@@ T@@ Q law in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured international head@@ lines several months ago when reports have been published that dealt with the spread , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested susp@@ icious que@@ er men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood she felt that she was actually a woman .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had learned of the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
for fear of her life , she moved to the USA in the end .
Sab@@ rina : I was working as a volunteer in a human rights organization .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from D@@ age@@ stan , a trans@@ woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can remove this dis@@ grace ? &quot;
after that , the photos from my documents went round the W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was doing a few shopping bags from my car &apos;s back seat , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here &apos;s a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long do you want to dish@@ on@@ est the family , you cry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and eventually woke up in the hospital .
apparently some women had got everything and started scre@@ aming .
the man fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung .
OC Media : what kind of nurse were you laid in - in the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very grateful for this .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am thankful to him that he has been respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I received threats .
they called me , wrote to me - relatives , strangers , some perfectly unknow@@ ns .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all was a lie .
they presented absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by acting on the top without going through the streets ; others wanted me to appear in Gro@@ z@@ ny on the official television and say that I had not changed my gender , that everything was just bad , and Photos@@ hop .
I have gran@@ ule size C - what should I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has humili@@ ated not only your family , but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you , because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too much for my mother and she laid a rope around her neck .
fortunately the neighbors came and rescu@@ ed them .
at that time , I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window was a car filled with dark windows and a plate of 95 .
after passing it for the third time , I realized that something was lazy .
my human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to reveal their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
I bought it without registering myself , without notice , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe you &apos;re security , just because you have left the country ?
our people know already in which hotel you are stuck . they even know your room number .
just to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
this was indeed my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we do not talk about gender equality , this is a tab@@ oo topic .
some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements are still in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I really try to look at the person she recalls from her past - that is , my mascul@@ ine form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : last week I submitted a report to Washington .
for me , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who saved one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he told that no people were arrested and tortured during Ram@@ adan , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan was barely able to wait , and he did not finish a new wave .
most likely , they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
with this I mean , they probably charge the relatives , they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has been experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are gay men still being detained in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend told me that there weren &apos;t too many .
if , above all , those who have no rich relatives or who have been left by their relatives in order to present themselves to Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s judgment .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can be presented later as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim that they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people had not simply disappeared , they were deliberately sub@@ merged in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise themselves .
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown .
there was nothing new from them ever since .
they simply took them with them .
and this so @-@ called Lord , that person was himself when these people were taken .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports so far . however , we suspect that such actions are possible .
why would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known in quite Gro@@ z@@ ny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
seriously !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was considered , I had never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer then than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia initially wanted to bring us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , bore tube jeans and short tops .
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria has never bent me even a hair .
before the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never offen@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they often say to children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they simply closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never offen@@ ded me , never hun@@ ted and never struck me .
OC Media : how long was this time of grace ?
Sab@@ rina : so long before Kad@@ y@@ row stepped on the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to speak about morality on television .
he did not speak about us per se , but primarily about women &apos;s behavior .
nevertheless - one could sense how people started to change in the city .
those who had previously laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at once looked at you with suspicion .
in time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the Republic constantly worsen@@ ed .
OC Media : what activity are you going to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as an activist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organise te@@ ac@@ ups , gather@@ ings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I don &apos;t have any c@@ ents for it for a long time .
I discovered these people myself when I ap@@ per@@ ated refuge .
I am Muslim and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that is sil@@ ly .
so nature is that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who want to sign up with foam in front of the mouth that there are no ga@@ ys with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ro@@ dents have which ones , the Russians have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something .
I meet so many men here from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
know , many think of transition to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation to be precise , different attitudes of life .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I will be so personally here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the local Arab population .
there has been a strong rise in suicide since the last few months .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with approval .
the inc@@ iner@@ ation of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran that is shaped by poverty and unemployment .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi &apos;s human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors were unable to do anything .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide which occurred in August within the Arabic Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the spot warn that more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family @-@ fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families because of the prosecution by the Iranian government , and to pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , where most of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the local Arab population to make a living .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy assumed power and in 1925 took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the native population only gets little of that wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically den@@ ies the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Arabs working in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a large number of dam@@ s to diver@@ t the waters from the Arab areas to the Persian regions , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ate the devast@@ ation caused by dro@@ ught , and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi people rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director for Co@@ operatives , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % of secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the mind of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights activist , resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , led to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process : &quot; &quot; &quot;
because function@@ aries and institutions do not prefer to hire Arab workers , local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance among young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home .
there are people who had to change their name and sur@@ name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone the speech of Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi have to endure , human rights activists kill alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is un@@ treated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I do not identify myself with femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ als &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . released under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons License .
the following article is a revised version of the statement auth@@ ored by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as an inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - react with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminine * inside .
for example , despite the same education , women still earn less money than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come across a glass ceiling before or later in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on sex is still spreading across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and three times below .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I come to speak on skin color , on racism , on black C@@ is women , black women in the LGB@@ TI@@ Q community or black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention the way we have always been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and out of the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent .
yet all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and sing &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to say that there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist violence in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , which we are exposed to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin less earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background often referred to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women are exposed to a higher risk in black spheres and women with a migration background to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men in any skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not associate myself as a black woman who refuses to consider in@@ justi@@ ces in her mind , which refers both to sex as well as to the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical sense a de@@ human@@ ized and margin@@ alized being .
I refuse to join groups who also by cultural appropri@@ ation absorb our customs and customs to advance their ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overl@@ apping skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to hold the importance of black women for the feminist movement dead , no matter how many black women try to instruc@@ t them for a better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and differentiate themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to get rid of femin@@ ism and join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ismus , which was launched for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of using me for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women in accordance with our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ ans : Rec@@ la@@ iming to defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can in this way create spaces where they are completely safe and in which the cultural , mental , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform themselves about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement that the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because I exist in this paradigm .
I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman .
I , a black woman , can flower in an environment where my life is neither b@@ yp@@ assed nor ignored nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that has recently reported international efforts to solve environmental problems .
as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled to Iraq last 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kurdistan region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq , a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance , which is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summ@@ ari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in one question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and published for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist based in Er@@ bil , Iraq .
the focus of her work lies on persecuted , un@@ noticed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of collaborative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with the help of oppressed communities to tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women portra@@ ys &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s mor@@ als in the country and in the region and to show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article entitled &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; by structural . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # wei@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been modified to protect affected persons .
a police com@@ miss@@ ar said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent against her .
since the end of their relationship a little time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena due to ill @-@ treatment , the acute ad of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez also did nothing .
a few days later , the second woman returned her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women ever make an ad , they generally do not receive support from the State .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to being victims of violence must be reported to the law enforcement authorities at all .
In@@ halt@@ 1 beats and statistics 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ments and a legal system that has nothing sub@@ ni@@ mm@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , defici@@ ent implementation strokes and statistics
it is hard to find out how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender questions at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social science research institute in Paraguay . &quot; there are various indications and reports that , however , do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
the numbers available , however , are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office filed a total of 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence . 70 % of them were violence against women .
86 % of the advertisements in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the Peace Coun@@ ts . 86 % of women &apos;s advertisements were also here .
in the ads , 40 % of women said that they were mi@@ stre@@ ated physically , 55 % of women spoke of mental mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
these statistics , however , do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister , Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , there are 9 women who do not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded for physical abuse , two women who do not do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , prosecution authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists included at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country .
the co @-@ ordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that doesn &apos;t under@@ line anything
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm girlfriend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she called him the name of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she continued . this was to regret it forever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she suffered the mental violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most appreci@@ able :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never thought I would be a victim of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that this only happens to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them .
many people responded to their posts , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he ever lifted his hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen from Carlos for such a long time and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complic@@ ity .
Victoria San@@ tos , who is not from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner ab@@ used them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in some way victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victori@@ an &apos;s case everything started with mental mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
she introduced a process against her former partner who developed into an un@@ man@@ age@@ able legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ciary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a draft bill was discussed at the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which became known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # für@@ st ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os movement are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original bill of the law stipul@@ ates that it must be explained and har@@ sh@@ ly pun@@ ishable by the fact that it is the case in neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the text of the law has been changed in some respects to also gain members for the law , who feared that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tion would be banned , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original bill envis@@ aged the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence must carry on themselves , if they simply provide an ad and would like to obtain a secure accommodation , to impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as a part of inter@@ personal relationships .
a re@@ think must take place here , so that violence is no longer seen as a normal thing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who are silent in view of these facts are complic@@ it and contributes to the fact that the offen@@ ders will get away . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to pay so long that ill treatment is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . before , parts of the law had been altered , including a passage that the partners called in cases of domestic violence to reconci@@ le .
opinions on the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
however , the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is regarded as a major set@@ back .

independent media in Oman continues to attack attacks one year after a newspaper ban
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed due to a decision of the Minister of Foreign Affairs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to read on the homepage of the banned paper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Mexican authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n due to their coverage of corruption in the sul@@ tan@@ ate .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he served a year @-@ old prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and brought to justice later .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after having placed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only sul@@ tan , he has held the most important positions in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sul@@ t@@ ans &quot; rule is marked by the stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly efforts of security forces , in particular domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , public fre@@ edoms , including freedom of the press , restric@@ ting journalists , blog@@ gers and other activists , in@@ timi@@ dating and incar@@ cer@@ ating .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens from expressing their views on the country &apos;s public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper which since its founding in 2007 was reported on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , took part in an article published in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 with the title &quot; High @-@ ranking parties tied to justice . &quot;
in the report , government officials were accused of having pressur@@ ized Justice of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n from July 26 , 2016 with a report on the front page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind the hands of the judi@@ ciary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a member of the Editorial Board , was invited by the ISS before the special department and was arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS held the deputy chief editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had been acting as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest .
the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper is prohibited on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i took place before the court in Mas@@ kat .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were condemned , among other things , for dis@@ ruption of the public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the Pres@@ ent of the State . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of infrin@@ gement of a ban on publishing and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es amoun@@ ting to 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year of imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network for the distribution of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
a deposit amoun@@ ting to 5000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) was set for Al @-@ Abr@@ i and he was released from custody on 22 August 2016 before the pron@@ oun@@ cement of the judgment .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ Abr@@ i at a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was fired on 10 April 2017 after serving his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j remains in prison where he will serve his one @-@ year prison sentence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Appe@@ als Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in spite of the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to return , the newspaper is facing attacks by the Iranian government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was extended by three months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further order in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and the minister once again ordered the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to re@@ pay the publication of the newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in Oman the freedom of the press was viol@@ ated in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
further injuries include closing the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ s@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the country &apos;s first independent online newspaper to cease operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j the impression arises that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) demands the om@@ anic authorities :
1 . to release You@@ se@@ f al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3 . protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances , to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have their legitimate human rights work un@@ imp@@ eded and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ anes .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blog@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting freedom of expression and association , and the right to gather , support and provide protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , representation takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on @-@ site : on the one hand , many medicines and vacc@@ ines are missing in the global healthcare system , which cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have far more serious effects in Africa &apos;s poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research into these diseases is a major problem .
second , the research carried out by African scientists is helping to build own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Center for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed a serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he researched the HIV virus himself before deciding to go back home to support the Serbian healthcare system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding of the media about this research .
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier R@@ W : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Serbian National Programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I am currently starting a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant pathogens .
G@@ WS : what do you think are the key current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
R@@ W : there is no fundamental research here . we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
that has to change , otherwise we will always remain receivers , rather than being M@@ acher .
the solutions we get are often not suitable for use in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
G@@ WS : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
R@@ W : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are promoted differently well .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
G@@ WS : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
R@@ W : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
G@@ WS : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
R@@ W : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
O : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support development ?
R@@ W : the potential is amazing .
I saw great students of all ages .
there is need for special scientific training , beginning at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , exploration of space , healthcare ( non @-@ communic@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa versus Western countries based on your experience ?
R@@ W : often it &apos;s the limited speed , things to do , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that are challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines produce articles only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has already been breeding a salad in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 sorts , such as Out@@ sh@@ ue , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many types of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding .
the patents are not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain and car@@ rot varieties . based on this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts for food security are concerned about the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a millen@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton is still breeding a salad , but it takes longer , since his work is more and more difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is like a b@@ oul@@ der lying in a river , around which I must be p@@ add@@ led . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go too far on salads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand trial , nobody can breed a new type of let@@ tu@@ ce because all the features are already patented . &quot; he continues to make as good as possible and tries to breed those traits he wants .
however , he is very cau@@ tious and endeav@@ ours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has also joined a movement that is becoming increasingly bigger in the US and all over the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breeding ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red tu@@ b@@ ular salad of the Out@@ ra@@ geous variety in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . it tests whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
it has been launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders .
as part of the initiative , shortly called Os@@ si , US breeders can agree that others can freely use the seeds bred by them .
this does not mean , however , that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders allow only others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties , and not to immediately send it out - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
dark views of the sea
for the Professor of the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si CEO Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection .
according to it , seeds play a role in larger cohesi@@ on such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent gro@@ wers would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg points out that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need to take control of seeds in the global agriculture industry , whose recent examples are the mer@@ gers of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer , which is , for example , offered on farmers markets , should also know that the manner in which this vegetable is bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to continuing to make their seeds available free of charge . thus , their approach is in contrast to patent seed and plant characteristics .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the ever increasing intellectual property rights to plant material , which is thus always available .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of Os@@ si , has worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all of the Car@@ rot characteristics are protected as intellectual property , making it either not or difficult to use for plant breeders .
such estimates do not exist for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by suggest that large @-@ scale planted plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than salad or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are grown so that they have specific desirable traits - from those that have improved their taste or colour to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and can withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant characteristics point out that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing for more and more patents . genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since changing conditions by climate change are much less predictable .
in an e @-@ mail Mon@@ san@@ to re@@ alizes C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and co @-@ operation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it contradic@@ ts , however , that intellectual property adver@@ ti@@ ses other gro@@ wers , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that anyone can follow as soon as the patent has expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
thus , such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes it by providing more material and expertise to the public . &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees this : wait 20 years for a patent to run , certainly not promoting innovations .
and if you have to wait so long to breed on plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the fight .
the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders do not have time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make farmers easier for farmers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us to continue using the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant characteristics : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves .
the plants form the plants themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant breeders in the Oregon and Os@@ si executive committee , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; he who breeds a variety breeds his own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for their cultivation of large quantities of her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , are breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is very opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such as operating in international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) , most smaller seed companies manage to survive also without patents - either they reject the patent or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton looks for salads in his breeding garden .

Mor@@ ton is also convinced that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I &apos;m working with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that are patented .
I constantly need new material for my catalogue , because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties for a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent it is protected for 20 years from competition , which makes it very easy in my opinion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; although the USA seems to be a leader in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , carries out an open @-@ source seed program . to preserve the seeds of traditional crops , the centre works with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German organization Agre@@ e works on an open @-@ source license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si obligation for breeders in the European Union .
( rules for the bree@@ der differ from country to country , which is why the Os@@ si obligation cannot simply be one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , has declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it advoc@@ ates the current practice of the European patent office , which permits patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organised a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organisations and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards seed pat@@ enting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed systems , explains that the Organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed systems for which scheduled start @-@ up should be scheduled next year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an association of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organization US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database of seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food , has published a report published by the Mc@@ Knight Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others .
the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by of Os@@ si hopes that more people will soon see him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has taken care of where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role in doing so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lu@@ by says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the latest aims of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet .
this time the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist met .
on the weekend of May 5th , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above .
in August , the network posted a statement on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities strongly critici@@ zed this step and promised to continue the work and efforts on human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true to its goal of defending freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it has never been as important as it is now .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news site M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ speaking edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Qatar @-@ based Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organization of the wave of web side barriers to the victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the spread of articles and articles he writes for in Egypt , not accessible websites and media .
now the blog , which he directed to circum@@ vent the cens@@ al apparatus of the Egyptian government , became the target of an attack .
blog@@ gers made good content as you did , the web will be much more useful than ever before . &#124;
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video how police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles revol@@ ve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada said to the blocking through the government and reflected what this means for him :
blocking blogs is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ ie@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and although the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege ; An arrest , a attempted murder , un@@ loading at the national Security Council , blocking blogs and any other website for which I worked .
2 ) They have proved that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , though only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles in order to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship .
but now after having locked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave go the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 6 August . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at .
also , af@@ te also documented the blocking of providers , through the circum@@ vention of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in their research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of web sites that offered V@@ P@@ N@@ s began .
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering the content that Egyptian users could have access .
the situation is also worsen@@ ed by the fact that the court decisions are taken behind closed doors , making the Egyptian population no legal basis by which they can proceed against these acts in court .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day after day , newspapers in all Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old is shot in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Die@@ eves rau@@ ben dispens@@ ary with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tim@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , navy and air to Rio . &quot;
in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation in 2017 , the wave of violence in Rio has reached the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports such as these have become common@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
so the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; published for the detailed coverage of Viol@@ ence in Rio published the editorial &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which she announced to set up a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now being published there .
the paper explains the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ bery , sexual crimes , etc . , but what happens from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens in Rio will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognise the war .
in the same video , a journalist told the newspaper that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper writes :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to disgu@@ ise the atro@@ cities of the police that only shoots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Maf@@ ia and its partners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; does the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harm more than it is used ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argues that violence as a &quot; war &quot; argues . according to her opinion , this is a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold accoun@@ tability to the police .
this is not war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as it has shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of public service .
as a reminder , the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Rio de Janeiro as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is wrong , according to Cec@@ í@@ lia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil lie in the north and north @-@ east of the country according to statistics from 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ones per state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is owned by Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , like Cec@@ í@@ lia , has been reiter@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years .
these security policy measures also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit established by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose objective is to capture a F@@ av@@ ela by using a massive police station and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases . however , after several years , the U@@ PP has been increasingly under fire after several reports of sham@@ ans and repres@@ sions against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also involves serious consequences for the people .
this requires the state to use resources and ways that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost bul@@ lets . &quot;
war back or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the F@@ av@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
a week later , police attacked the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ ar@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : bes@@ et Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer under brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops .
according to Siege Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria institutes , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib .
the East Gh@@ out@@ a region , where chemical weapons attack on August 21 , 2013 , is particularly affected by hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition , based on investigations from the United Nations and other human rights organisations , assume that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these rebel controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege , leading to the fact that local residents are dependent on locally produced or tunnels and control points .
through years of block@@ age , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as a life @-@ saving food source .
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ ni@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not part of the traditional food planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian food . however , their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the di@@ version of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed its relief that it now becomes more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; becoming known . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ mir@@ a , use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of planting mushrooms , according to Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative relies on generators that keep temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel shortage , locally produced fuel from plastic will be used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mushroom seed production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when this was done , they used a larger bowl . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have spread fung@@ us everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a for free .
Dr. Lei@@ la said that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the fung@@ al @-@ breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking of the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source in the market .
dis@@ semination of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food resi@@ dues ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc . ) for the extraction of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are tied to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success and our fight against hunger and the siege will become visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experiences to inspire people in crisis areas and help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese call for justice for the victims of fires in 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many capital cities in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ ant in the north of Portugal last week .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government &apos;s last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
bran@@ dies were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 explo@@ sions that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite imagery , about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
all Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a . ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15 , 2017
some of Twitter users split images :
this is Bra@@ ga tonight . # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal # Bra@@ ga # F@@ og@@ os@@ PT
numerous videos spread in the network and show images that allow for better insights into what is happening :
the unfor@@ es@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the Saturday protests was the demand for better preventive and fire @-@ fighting measures by the state .
people asked why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al of the federal government of Portugal declared P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o &apos;s paper :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this : there are dozens of reports of open roads en@@ cir@@ cled by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria a similar tragedy would have happened in June as the streets were locked very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , building appro@@ vals in locations with high fire risk are questioned .
a far @-@ reaching reform proposal introduced by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was obj@@ ected by the municipalities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a cancellation of the law , which allowed the construction activity of case @-@ case if the applicant had a means of self @-@ protection - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adds Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of readily combus@@ tible wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , spread to the fires of this species .
these problems add to the fact that the website of civil protection from Portugal on October 15 and 16 , when citizens were seeking information or attempted to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the people with information : they used their own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of the fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so crucial in this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers were not able to resist the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires .
even the founder asked for help :

the path from Afghanistan to a successful entrepreneur

in one night in the fall of 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan had become a land of terror and despair .
at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner .
even though his mother didn &apos;t say that at that time , she knew that she wouldn &apos;t see her son for a long time - maybe even more .
at dawn , the boy should break up .
his uncle would pick it up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt protective .
the Taliban , known for their hatred for the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself again in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal pit . the work was hard and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his low wages , and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mort@@ ars , who were heavier than himself in order to earn his living .
back then , like today , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we also worked .
there were no services and no heating . we hung N@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we wouldn &apos;t freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without paper@@ work in Iran and made ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , walking alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy twice a day .
it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high ratings . however , it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers are found in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the large majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised institutions in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially have submitted an application for asylum - which can still apply for months after the registration of the asylum application .
until then , people who do not have money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so there was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his unt@@ amed li@@ festyles helped A@@ shar@@ k to free himself from these conditions soon .
after having made various work in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ k put his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis Succ@@ ess Story is now the subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
in 2017 , the film received the Venice City Award , which was presented for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for employers in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to un@@ official estimates around 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , a number of Afgh@@ ans have emerged , including d@@ ress@@ ings , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant is told by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts the history of their trip to Italy .
the Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the Restaurant Peace &amp; amp in Pad@@ ua ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a S@@ ushi Restaurant in Rome also have Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims to reach far beyond the Italian restaurant trade and retail trade and aim back to the country that he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ k with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know my people are suffering .
I am planning a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ges plans for opening a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packing and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their harvest surplus on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end stand stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now , he also wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .

global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen report is an international snapshot showing challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that allows users to use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registering with a government authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
users would have to register to make use of the social networks , register within six months after a successful law@@ suit on the authority &apos;s website stating their full name and ID number .
those who failed this step could be sentenced to six months imprisonment or the tri@@ mming of a penalty .
the law , which was promoted by sixty members of the Parliament , is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , another member of the Parliament presented a proposal in which harder pun@@ ishments for the insul@@ t of the President or a senior official would be introduced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the law of law , however , such action would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as well as legal experts from the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who took photos on 13 August 2013 when he took photos against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of elected President Mohamed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 prot@@ esters arrested at the same incident , four years in jail on a court date .
recently , his hearing was postpon@@ ed to 20 May , because the prison administration failed to bring the accused to the court room according to human rights groups .
Sha@@ w@@ kan poses death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , head@@ light of e.g. arms , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza cleared the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged with their coverage of pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the aforementioned incident , from 25 years to five years .
Tunisi@@ an activists stop di@@ gest@@ ed documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project .
the plan comes from the President of the Republic who , according to the plan , explicitly supports a controversial bill of law , which would ensure business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption indic@@ ted officer Am@@ nesty , provided that all funds returned un@@ law@@ fully .
this document , published on 21 April on Na@@ wa@@ at &apos;s website , sheds light on how the presidential plans look to support the La@@ ws of the La@@ ws .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the mention of his sources stating article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code , which ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness .
does China want to force the users of social media to present their identification ?
according to the new rules of the National Council of People &apos;s Republic of China , social media users in China need permission before they write or share messages in social media .
it is also stated in the rules that registration will be required with the full real name .
analysts suggest that the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks is to be achieved . it is unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat ? &quot;
not in Russia !
in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ com@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat had to register as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organis@@ er of information broad@@ ening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the provincial government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government performs a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make said services to remove content and to force it upon request to susp@@ end user data .
these websites currently include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ classi@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court decre@@ es ban Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the blocking of Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ speaking articles , the data , Turkey supported jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication issued that the site was blocked because it came to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an information source working with groups to insti@@ gate a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain cannot stop to sni@@ ff up
following this week &apos;s document , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation on increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor utilities that de@@ code data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
