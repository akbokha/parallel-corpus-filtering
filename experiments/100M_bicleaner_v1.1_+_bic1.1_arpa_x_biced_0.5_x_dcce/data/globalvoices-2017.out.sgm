<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American writers and practised his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American movie.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, how he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican cover, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, revealed the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate who wanted to occupy the upper federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "freely to Method Man," "" "I was like this is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA only strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country where I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very fanatical love letter about its size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never thinks of the mountain in his opinion, as you say so nicely.</seg>
<seg id="16">He tells exactly what he thinks as a former colleague expressed it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the people responded to his statements and voted for him in pairs.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican elections was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever achieved.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program that takes people from all over the world, a deeply devout person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Trumps Weltanschauung did not correspond with that of Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "Bhatia and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the" "" "Phoenix Suns" "" "at the game." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights for the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits to the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Feiney, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values represented by them deepened my love towards America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump accepted his way to the nominees Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it turned out that they were the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly white, gave the presidency to a man, despite - or perhaps precisely because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it's unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, one of my friends said, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom know, voted for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might want to say that they are still important in America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who comments on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (WC.): as much like "white against all other ethnicities," the white and whiplash word play, which means as much as the Great Van Jones, has killed exactly what America has done so splendidly.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which belief or background you may always have, America is welcome everybody.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this land chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history as he himself says nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white American saying this promise and says: to Hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America? "asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd answered with a loud" "" "No!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"do Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd roared." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they answered." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried, and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "if someone is not like you, have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan ended in saying: "thank God, Mr. Trump, it is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is Trumps Land now, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music that is played in both places not only has changed the life of the children, but also a very close relationship with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an ancient colonial city that is popular among tourists - but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now La banda de MÃºsica (Music bande) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults who have found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become central to the church of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico is known for its use of drugs and bananas.</seg>
<seg id="77">But after a random encounter with a French pilot, who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare glimmer of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, the local press noticias Oaxaca NVI writes:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the hustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the Conga to play.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village that lies practically on top of the largest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made from recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprocessed instruments made up of local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the Recycler led by Favio Chavez began turning parts of waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, viola, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all of which were made out of the trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez remembers a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, at the beginning time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage The kids knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin made of trash.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments made of reprocessed material and which calls itself The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentary called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of garbage every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspiring performance from trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries demonstrate how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for the joint use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia's waters before the other coast of Africa sought.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were correspondingly upset and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this species at their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comorators, Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobilised against the ship. they refused to stamp one of their ports and refused to grant him a fisherman's license.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior officer of the Kenyan fisheries authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was expelled from the waters of the region: it was not successful to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was forced to pay $2 million in Liberia for pillage of the land's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries that was founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries).</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries who had expelled the Premier from their waters at that time.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. this makes illegal fishing a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By the deliberate disregard of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fisheries can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also by the snail's pace, with information between individual countries, the actions are happening in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">For example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licences, news on suspicious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea, via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas. also, such suspicious routes can be detected - such as those suggesting that a ship loads its captured fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally such studies can show whether the ships involved have a fishing license where they were on the go and possibly whether they have a penal code.</seg>
<seg id="116">On the basis of this information, countries that are opposed to illegal fishing may refuse to accept such vessels in their ports. what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then it's about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue which the eight members of the HISH-i network lose each year because of illegal fishermen entering East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries that attracts commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include such actions as sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specifying fantasies, fishing protected species and fishing in protected areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an unbroken control system," "" "Long." "" "earlier, a ship was able to fish illegally and a country could then say" "" "You wouldn't run my port." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me." "" "and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has participated in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licences in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found wing-wing ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international agency for the fight against crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that aims to help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to detect the illegal ships that would like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position," "" "says Duncan Copeland, head analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO which also deals with fisheries data and provides technical support to FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, switch off their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information. FISH-i will help to find criminal operating ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">One model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence this undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, president of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform with Google and the marine protection organization Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be used to display the position of every single trackable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors, to get a better picture of who does what, it simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global scale." "" "" "" "Lev Charitable trusts has a similar project where a global system allows the prosecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detract criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that were fished without a license and had hardly expected consequences now know that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i now have a 33% increase in fisheries sales since fisher boats buy more licences.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to detect Greko 1, the inspectors found towing nets where they were banned.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "Kiilu says." "" "we are a study object." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries joined forces to join the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i. "" With certainty, the aim of even more such initiatives and structures is to be made in other regions, "says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia was able to announce its first big triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship that was on the way under a false flag. and not only was the ship on the road without a license and used towing nets which are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also invaded into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "taking measures against Greko 1 is a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time evidence that such a collaborative working method for the protection of the oceans actually works across the world ocean.

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered to be a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the inauguration of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the return of Venezuela) pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country - including in the inland area of Barinas, in the Andes regions MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, in the central north-north country of Carabobo and at the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country continuously deteriorates, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medicines.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw in the removal of the current president NicolÃ¡s Maduro, the chance for a fundamental change; however, the reluctance of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne DÃ­az, contributor at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the government decision in its latest article:</seg>
<seg id="163">As part of the social, political and economic crisis, where inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated to be 500% for the end of the year) and in which a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine is, the referendum needed to give the country a chance to regain its institutional structures and to establish a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad DemocrÃ¡tica or shortly MUD (approximately: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined together, urged the demonstrators to continue on 27 October to support the National Assembly. in addition, a twelve-hour strike on the Folktag and a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government seat, should continue to continue.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among others, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is as far as Venezuela: morning National Assembly, Friday national civil strike and on 3 November all to Caracas to the Miraflores Palace.</seg>

<seg id="178">There the demonstrators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advocates of the government according to their own statement.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later, they were able to leave the cathedral once more, but the protests continued.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adaptation of an interview by Alejo GÃ³mez with Luis Quijano, who was published on August 23, 2016 at DÃ­a a DÃ­a, an Argentine news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to see the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian city of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult, Quijano now said in the context of the great La Perla Ribera trial in the province of CÃ³rdoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, was subjected to crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Beginning with the burden of bearing the same name as his father, up to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept family secrets.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I thought it was okay.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child at the age of 15 one does not realize that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I couldn't realize that my father was a thief, torturers and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis was not a choice: his father, Luis Alberto Quijano, was a gendarmerofficer. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was the deputy commander of the intelligence department 141 in La Perla prison until 1978.</seg>

<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos's son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of the atrocities he had experienced as a boy, and who testified before a Federal Constitutional Court against his own father.</seg>

<seg id="217">"" "they called him" "" "Kent" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black-white photo and asked me to identify my friend on that.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you made yourself friends with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">"" "" "" "just that they don't deceive you one day and I have to save you." ""</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP is for EjÃ©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo, - Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers "party of Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore he charged me to go back to the sports hall. a few days later, he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me I would become secrecy.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok. because so my father educated me.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base, I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all sorts of documents: University degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, simply everything.</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla with - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barracks, in cars, furniture, television, fridges - just everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a little packet wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big lump of silver there.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen objects were dropped and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">Then the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I sped in and saw a lie that men were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They seldom bind a man with handcuffs to the bed, poured it with water and chased him a charge of 220 volts into the genitals.</seg>

<seg id="243">The stench there was horrific... like a dirty diaper.</seg>
<seg id="244">Years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I immediately recognized the smell and I realized that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>

<seg id="251">In the background, I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people were lying down with the face - all were tied at hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">Close to the entrance, people chewed quietly on the mattresses.</seg>

<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this because my father told me at home.</seg>

<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanization.</seg>
<seg id="265">When they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the order from above was to be transferred.</seg>

<seg id="274">This is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">I was always asking myself how my father, the head of security forces, could participate in this vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer at the gendarmerie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>

<seg id="283">We don't need anyone else!</seg>
<seg id="284">So my father was.</seg>
<seg id="285">I don't have a single good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">When I was in the process, I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a woollen jacket pullover. both had my father from La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="287">We were not poor, but he still brought clothes home.</seg>
<seg id="288">At that time, the defence accused me of being a conspirator in this crime. I replied, no problem, they can lay down to me what they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="289">I was there anyway to testify.</seg>

<seg id="295">Well, you were executing people during the dictatorship, but why did the bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="296">Why do children kidnap?</seg>
<seg id="297">One day my father brought a girl home, whose mother was killed.</seg>
<seg id="298">She was like our pet, almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl.</seg>
<seg id="299">I always asked myself: they were tortured, but why were they killed?</seg>
<seg id="300">It would have been easy to put them in prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill these people. but why did their bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not even have families, to whom one could commit their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the corpse is the last abominable act that man can do.</seg>
<seg id="304">My father told me when democracy was reintroduced, they brought machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners.</seg>

<seg id="309">I was even at the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just told the truth about 20 criminals, including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The thought to display my father was created during a conversation when he was under house arrest.</seg>

<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened center in which one can prolong his driving licence, last month witnessed a very unfortunate translation.</seg>
<seg id="348">"" "on a shield, the Japanese word was" "" "made" "" ", which means" "" "older motorists" "", "falsely - perhaps even with evil hind thanks & # 8212; as" "" "dreadful motorists" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September.</seg>
<seg id="350">Adaptation of Joshua Levine's original photos, which was often shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was the translator Julian Holmes, an inhabitant of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The in-house daily Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could such an English translation come about?" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation corrected.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "this is an insult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable" "", "Holmes said." ""</seg>
<seg id="356">"" "the bad English translation was removed first. the name" "" "terrible drivers" "" "(German:" "" "terrible drivers" "" ") was later replaced by the appropriate, if also grammatically correct name" "" "elder drivers" "" "(German:" "" "older drivers" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="357">The police prefecture of Kyoto apologized for the translation mistake. furthermore, she explained that the error was already included in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for their accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger covered the apologies as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we sincerely regret that elderly people felt insulted by the inadequate correction (the translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News dealt a bit more extensively with the phenomenon of the "awful" elderly motorists in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "awful" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older motorists. according to the police, the proportion of elderly motorists who are involved in accidents nationwide, however, is a cause of concern." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of 19,460 seniors were caused by seniors in 2005. this equates to a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors created 1,803 of total 11,850 accidents.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language, which could make translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that do not have foreign employees can still make translations in-house. then the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is rated as the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The verbose and enigmatic sentences that arise due to machine translation show that this technique is not yet able to replace human translators for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic imprints which often decorate t-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. however, from large corporations or government who have the means to guarantee higher standards, we can expect more thorough translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">Hopefully, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more reputable source for its translations.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Navegar con Libertad" (Free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the websites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasters also carried out footage of protests in Caracas organized by opposition groups that opposed the government NicolÃ¡s Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in early April after the Supreme Court disbanded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court himself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was snapped and recommended users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># censorship: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that websites of Venezuelan providers are again locked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the page of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offerings such as Vivoplay are popular among Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to report protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunication threatened them with fines and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels, I registered to @ vivoplaynet again.</seg>
<seg id="403">Amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiletto later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the domain name system (DNS), but also two other online channels.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to requests of certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If an Internet site is blocked by DNS, the server responds incorrectly or refuses to request such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNA lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third sealed channel, the broadcast was discontinued on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV camera Elvis Flores, who transferred the protests to Caracas live, was imprisoned.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten, while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">He was released eight hours later, and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still available via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates Internet connections: this makes Venezuelans access to multimedia coverage of current events in the country more and more difficult.</seg>

<seg id="414">Today, Tina fights for children's rights and collects testimonies of other Crimes, who became victims of abuse and discrimination.</seg>

<seg id="416">The following article is the shortened version of a report written by Global Voices with kindly permission of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen," which is edited and republished by Global Voices in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family living there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation from university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house proudly talking about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one who has become something," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she started working as a criadita for the family. when Criaditas are called the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is simple: a large family with little money passes her underage son or her underage daughter to another more rich family. in exchange, the child receives food, a training and a roof over her head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned is that the children have to pay for innumerable days of housework, which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice referred to as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a couple of years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas, especially young girls who were affected by the practice of criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude which is inoculated to the Crimes guarantees in general silence.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double illusion," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family that their daughter in the belief that they complete their education, improve their position in society and "make something out of themselves" can be transferred to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who takes up the girl and justifies its exploitation by faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and perhaps even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is mistreated, his family will experience it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experience it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon, which is taking place in seclusion in Paraguayan households, got a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina MarÃ­n entered the hospital in CaaguazÃº, her body showed signs of severe beatings. shortly thereafter she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">It was Criadita in the household of the former military personnel of TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived with them in their house in VaquerÃ­a, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital of AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira joined MarÃ­n as long as he suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a cricket.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the practice of criadazgo rooted deeply in the Paraguayan society for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">"" "they called the Criadazgo as" "" "a modern form of slavery." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="446">"" "several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that" "" "no more Carolina" "" "in Paraguay could give." ""</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered as children," complained Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without paperwork, it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for swift investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n could be indicative - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay comes a case of Criadazgo.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are exploited not only as labour force, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the caribbean, in which her father worked, had to register bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to go all the way and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money.</seg>

<seg id="460">In her employer's house Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time in such a way that she still remained time for learning.</seg>
<seg id="462">She got up every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">Fridays, for example, cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over, she went back home and had time for learning.</seg>
<seg id="465">The sooner she finished learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because she had to do dinner for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">"" "Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but didn't get unlimited food." "" "I was allowed to get more books from the master's library as food from the fridge," "" "she recalls." ""</seg>

<seg id="469">At some evenings, the master Alvarenga forced to stand beside him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to persuade them to give no faith to the official media reports about the dictator's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">"" "he thought she was intelligent but did not talk to her." "" "the landlord had found someone who listened as he spoke about politics," "" "she says." ""</seg>

<seg id="505">"" "" "" "within six months with the adoption of the law, users should have to register on the website of the site with their correct names and ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks." ""</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do this, it could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a fine.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs and curses in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice, video and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration on users. it is also unclear how they should make up those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to guarantee regulation at the level of social media companies.</seg>

<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that just as they are forcibly controlling physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take them seriously, it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who request permission or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to bring them to a court process.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, the northeastern Japan, documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple disaster" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, tsunami and an atomic accident in Fukushima have caused the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi Prefecture was a significant prefecture in Japan's Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring villages of Fukushima and Iwate were forcibly evacuated, because the tsunami had disappeared entire coastal towns from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, Fukushima's prefecture has had a nuclear accident, already on its own, 160 000 inhabitants have had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows, from the local point of view, which progress has been reached six years after, in order to rebuild the life of the local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop. Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="550">Housing construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses (roofing), saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi recorded the greatest success among the three prefectures. here 80 percent of the planned replacement parts were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such buildings while Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">At the same time, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by Behelfshabitui (on the right hand, kasetsu juutaku) were to be resettled into final spare-houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple disaster almost 80,000 people were forced to live in homes.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Nearly 40 percent of the evacuated people from Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuated people who breathed after disaster were resettled into final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1,100 schools affected by misfortune have opened their gates until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 per cent of fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 per cent of fishing ports have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident were heavily affected in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmlands of Fukushima are located in the "nuclear barrier zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">Tourism has recovered largely in two of the three prefectures, but also here Fukushima continues to decline.</seg>
<seg id="567">The number of tourists in Miyagi and Iwate is up to 90 percent on the same level as before. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only have 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coast-inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to be able to determine the overall picture, the newspaper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuates.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article Kahoku Shimpo explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to find out more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="575">As to those who had to be evacuated from Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuated people from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to witness not only the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima Prefecture was also witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Out of 160,000 evacuated people from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were relocated to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, more than 23,000 people were resettled back to Fukushima, in permanent spare-houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">According to the state of 2017, there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home-prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuated ones are older than 50 years old. they are known to retire right away because the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are building projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020.</seg>

<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studies social sciences at the federal university of GoiÃ¡s, has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Ãlvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane mills in Cuba closed the doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The community of Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabque, is widely known as el Central, Spanish sugar mill, regardless of the fact that there is no appreciable sugar harvesting on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane mills were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the fall, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the job.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resigned and commute daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran who stands up every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east, which are in operation after a long inactive period, because they were received.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene seems to have heard that in MaÃ±alich the sugar cane plant would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, poor administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for concern for the country several decades ago, but the bad harvests are not news anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the municipality saw even better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane mills were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they became intolerable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives leading to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugars must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 report "Agricultural perspectives" by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will certainly enter history," "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the shutdown of 98 sugar cane mills, more than 65 million people, received their full salary for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>

<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are in the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first closing year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">These were officially authored documents, which differed only in relation to the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulan Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was over and the letters became more and more frequent.</seg>

<seg id="690">Recording a song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people from First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do it through hip hop, thanks to a series of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the teacher David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked together with ten Cree communities in Montreal and then collaborated with the Cree hip-hop group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop is going to make the young participants learn topics such as "cultural identity, language, engagement, love, self-acceptance" or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the core of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia tells, for example, the history of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a road section in western Canada, where almost two dozen indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation is.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youths did not always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song, the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation is recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved were given some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstar hip-hop group, who gave them a stopper in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available in transcript, as well a translation into English, which is translated into German here:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to keep my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life as a youth</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and go forward with our youth as well.</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they intended for the Creator.</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan it is possible to see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, are exhibited near the entrance to shokuhin sanpuru, "plastic models of the dishes") of any food served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers will see these plastic dishes and decide whether they will enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry devoted to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">There are a large number of small companies in the district of Kappabashi that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders has documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them any more. however, a new trend is now turning them into showy mobile accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">With Naver matome the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new plastic ribbons decorated with plastic ribbons, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods were transformed into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food supplies is increasingly becoming more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an imperial-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) was transformed into a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular dish (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also produced this part for the exhibition in Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile support and cell phone designers allow you to create your own work of art. in this case, ikura or laughing stock is used, a popular topping served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there someone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter cheats?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasantly.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the shape of melted ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also paddy balls (onigiri), earrings and wristbands from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further whimsical plastic dishes can be viewed at: itinii's Naver matome blog post. or follow Twitter on the hashtag #.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry. for example, with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the misconceptions and translutions regularly appear only in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings with them.</seg>
<seg id="750">The report on drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the leader of the Sinaloa Cartel, completely forced the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the mourners or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every body, behind every bone finding in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">For this reason, the Mexican news portal animal PolÃ­tico has launched the digital project Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" learning with drug trafficking "), which aims to give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were caught in the struggle between the law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>

<seg id="759">"" "a video titled" "" "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" "" "(German:" "" "how afraid life changes" "" ") tells exactly these stories." ""</seg>

<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership." ""</seg>

<seg id="780">Hi, of course this post is genuinely nice and I have learned lot of things from it on the topic of blogging. thanks. OdpovedaÅ¥</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the composure.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug traffickers) when he is big. and it is not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of offenders when they walk through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who fear that something has happened to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "" "" "the inaction of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village is justified by the fact that they were" "" "rocky" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies when they don't stir and stand still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months of blackmail in the main district:" how a family has been plundered with threats. "it describes how armed criminals each month paid money from their business until they had not only destroyed the business but also tore their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your entire life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain of this never passes away, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again if you are alone.</seg>

<seg id="799">"" "journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the article" "" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a generation drawn by violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, cook potatoes, tortillas warm and "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - inexpressible for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years ago when he was only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody lark of his father, who was shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, as a result of organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Citizens Council for Public Security and the Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office had 3103 killings. this equals to average of 8.5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and invade the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal PolÃ­tico has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose objective is to portray the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trade, which has tormented the country over the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="819">But how is the year after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release, it has been misguided to photograph tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of image and event - "false description" or "false context" in terminology from Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful coverage of events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures of news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tank truck traversed the village of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and devastated. the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank wagon fell victim to death.</seg>
<seg id="828">Government officials described a fireball that enveloped dozens of houses including a movie that was full of people looking at the world championships.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and charmed corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were incinerated.</seg>
<seg id="831">"" "a picture with the title" "" "That is Nigeria" "". "by Imgur user mystical Monkey, 12th January 2015.Several photos of the incident depict the horrible scenes of this day." ""</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of cluttered bodies, which are lined up on the floor while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here history does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo has been recorded several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened and what happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses drastically reported atrocities to which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "nobody stayed behind to count corpses," "" "said a Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only by using satellite images the follow-up time could be illustrated graphically.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unclear, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerian and the attempt of Boko Haram to gain land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the DR Congo, as it was wrongly presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, the abusive use of the DR Congo image is only one in a number of abortions; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the image was presented as a proof of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One more step further, personal comments, such as this example, falsely bring the picture from the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning detection, published by the United Nations, those who could flee could flee, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported about the violence against Rohingya, posts like the following have emerged that brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news site, which in 2012 falsely claimed that the President of Burma Than has said that monks and politicians had participated in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the picture from DR Congo to photograph this information.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two powerful themes or frames (frames) that go through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the killings of Christians by Muslims or - in defence of Muslims - the killings of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth examining how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question, however, is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are dozens of people who are unwittingly involved in drinking water around tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this mood of misinformation and misinformation that actual atrocities are untrue and adorn the actual horror of what has actually happened in DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been extensively debated (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that the retention of images of a refusal equals the tragedy. sometimes these images are even asked by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent imagery can desensitize readers and viewers and take the ability to feel empathy (for example, this study that investigates how violent media works to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss regarding violent representations in the news media, it is true that they are indispensable for today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake News." they will have to think carefully about the situation in which a picture may be somewhat sugary, which can actually be used by the context or completely abusive way.</seg>
<seg id="940">Any investigation of false attributions should also take into account how internationally they can be.</seg>

<seg id="943">Photoby Andy Simmons uses according to CC BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e.g. confusing) strives to provide language enthusiasts a choice of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words can be found in any language: they express certain situations or feelings, which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well-known today (like the famous Portuguese Saudade) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobrechta).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly to every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists cover Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog, for example, you can find words from the Mwotslap language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Take care of your parents in recognition of how they have made an effort in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - the convenience or laziness that you feel after you have warmed yourself in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They deflate other cultures, reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page to publish more of these "irreplaceable" words and show how different, valuable and impressively these little languages are.</seg>

<seg id="972">After a statement from the Sri Lanka's disaster center on 28 May 2017, 126 people were killed and nearly 100 people were missing because of the floods and sludge winds.</seg>
<seg id="973">More than 400,000 people have been affected since last Friday (26 May) and about 100,000 people have been brought to 304 safe locations.</seg>
<seg id="974">The rainfalls were closed on Saturday (27 May) and the water levels in some areas slowly decreased.</seg>
<seg id="975">Health and hygiene conditions of the population are a massive challenge in the affected and still inaccessible areas.</seg>
<seg id="976">The following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster:</seg>
<seg id="977">High water in Tawalama City with water distances of up to 7.5 meters. Twitter users like Azzam Ameen and Sri Lanka Tweet provide regular updates on the flood situation.</seg>

<seg id="982">Various organizations and startups have also been preparing to help.</seg>

<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves to be a Muslim in different kinds. but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims, like I do not fit in, are being disposed of.</seg>
<seg id="1010">To be abused</seg>
<seg id="1011">I'm not alone.</seg>

<seg id="1017">Islam, the Koran, and Prophet Muhammad were to the day when he died, the centre of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But in the Western imagination, religion was erased by Rumis, as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry.</seg>

<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognize that when French, Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings and forcing Saudi-Arab, Muslim women to cover their entire body, these are both sides of the same coin.</seg>

<seg id="1135">Telling stories, by Flickr users Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the unenforceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States where TLS has already carried out events since 2015, the risk of small and not very small languages will not be passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project the following applies:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that assume diversity - secure spaces where people don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while listening is often associated with" "" "listening to understand" "" "these events instead" "" "listen to, feel, touch" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers present their history first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their dedication and representation make sure that the audience realizes.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They cry out laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate is also seizing the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamuses ara tells the story of the hares and baboons in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after explaining the meaning of his beak, John Nyamuses ara asked:" "" "how is this to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" "" "with a broad smile, he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to extend this. anyone who is inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own story narrative guides.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounts to 72 million US dollars, several religious and civil organizations participated in a mass demonstration last 3 April 2017; the march started at the Puertoria Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went to the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the old town of San Juan.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la Deuda" (citizen front for the neural examination of debts) and the ecumenical congregation of Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of refixing the debts have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>

<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, Managing Director of Book Sprints, produces excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The costs of freedom: collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year and available here royalty-free contains a number of essays that deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book aims to discuss how to build movements for free knowledge and what the real costs are with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the Movement for Free Knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feed and to create some sense from our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was taken out of the directory of the Adra prison where he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book titled "Collective Remembrance" gives his friends and family a voice that pushes for his release and wants to know him back in his normal life and freedom, instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel is paying a high price for his participation in a free culture has led many of us to think about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of periodically extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">"" "his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" "" "military police Bassel had taken part in Adra on the basis of a" "" "strictly secret" "" "command from his cell in Adra." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that on 12 November 2015, she was contacted by persons who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, his place of residence and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently passes the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basque's cultural prototypes was more profane than the work he started with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross of numerous civilizations and here fuse Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel did not know that ten years after working with this work, the IS would do everything to extinguish this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Syria but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life with dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a commission which she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the texts to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic to English.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mosambique reacted with anger at a corruption case where a government member returned after half of his prison sentence to the workplace in the state machine where corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 together with four other defendants for embezzlement of 54 million meticals (about 800 000 euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds of Mozambique's airports, whose advice was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for its re-adjustment to the company, which happened on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic which rejected the request, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza to return to his old post as the company did not carry out disciplinary proceedings after his arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not call the action good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, short CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, in an interview with Deutsche Welle strongly condemned the decision of the company to reposition the Director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in terms of the efforts of our legal system," "" "said CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company ought to have initiated a disciplinary proceedings against the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"" "" "" "however, the company apparently remained silent and did not take appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions." ""</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" "" "disgusting" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent guy, he would be a consultant, after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them served.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent he has agreed to be reintegrated into the company he helped to cause harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Refly!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, a young Muslim and student of political science in Brazil, says the director has no moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he insulted him. I cannot believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already so massively insulted the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks morals to return and serve the state, * he had already a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead served himself by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as though it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself was tired of this man who was summoned and eventually sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts out of the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origins of the word are still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "dating" "" "(in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely deflected connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" "" "" "Kalar" "" "may be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically generate hate speech." ""</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts where they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about their use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same character sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, Burmese chair is also written 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar OAT' (Kamel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The faceboody Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' like this:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because it contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The phrase ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is the opinion that she will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook needs to be more analytic before it extinguishes all posts that are suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "Facebook does not delete the word" "" "Kalar" "" "manually." ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write on Factook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who propagate hate speech have received quite a good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to cut off its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to everyone who propagates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of catchwords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks will simply start using a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">Author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new policy of Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to copy, post and share content for 24 hours, because the post "didn't meet the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his opinion of why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khin believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example, the Burmese Internet community for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">"" "" "" "Facebook may have a benevolent intent to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work." ""</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "in addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as" "" "stools" "" "or" "" "pea curry." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not attempt to correct the wrongly deleted posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits that gave them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship has caused a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and deliberately write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the web.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that did not contain hate speech, but were removed:</seg>

<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks is supposed to increase violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine region, where conflict between Muslims and Buddhists forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for its failure to bring out the rampant hate speech on its Burmese pages.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The children's marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the Parliament of the country unanimously approved a law that should ban this practice, so that the age-capable age is now at 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Prior to this amendment of the marriage law, some members of Hindu and Muslim religious communities had adhered to practice, and in May 2016 there came to a great public outcry. at that time, Brother Harrypersad Maharaj, a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere because that, age does not determine maturity.

<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Federal Statistical Office of the country confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married between 1997-2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements that were eager to abolish laws on children's marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring about this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">However, everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu leader, for example, had no hesitation to say to the critics of the children's marriage, they should, condemned to take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really complicated matter, and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But in early 2017, the bill was decided against child marriage - despite 4 Senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent one contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "now only the president of the country must agree and let the law be announced." ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators posted a status update on Facebook, which reposted Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Senator Clarence Rambharat: bill against child marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for it and not a single one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Having previously been decided by the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">"" "" "" "the majority of social media users were enthusiastic because the laws on children's marriage had finally been changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who suffers a ministerial post in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk, which has disguised the core of the thing, but do you know what? the children's marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that's worth almost every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel was of the opinion, it was definitely long enough to abolish the practice, Lara Queuall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day was finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook by Lara Quentral - Thomas, which says:,, Excellent news!</seg>

<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group that spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The age of marriage in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious affiliation 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft on the amendment of the marriage law was decided today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>

<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the shape of satellite Maharaj, the general secretary of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the country's most famous Hindu organization.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj has announced his intention to take legal steps, the law should be passed, and he seems to make his promise now.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General Paris Al rawi, a propondent of the law, said that if Maharaj wanted to go against the law, most social media users wanted to approach the debate on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Rather Sat, if we, instead of discussing the discussion so generally, in a way that only panic and unease can provoke, if we, instead of speaking of the problem that we, would be used to abuse the state in our bedroom, "would you then be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States, internationally darkened.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">Since more than a month, Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day, it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share useful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech savvy Internet users are used to using conversion tools for blocked web pages (an up-to-date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third biggest VPN prevalence in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been writing articles from Wikipedia, as described recently in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the internet have been held since 2007, after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to be locked, several MirrorPages (pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated) are now dipped.</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform put all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. machine computer connections), which does not support the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "" "" "the content is however vocable despite legal prohibition." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After listening to the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we put all the snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. so there is the possibility to read the content in a distributed and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia articles even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also admitted that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has produced both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a MirrorPage of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar Mirrorpages when locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member as well as employees at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy-address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access a different URL that is not the original. that which you can see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server further directs the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with badly positioned motifs and balanced colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to take a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal's wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown, next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class location helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of the Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti River a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the leopard was located and I immediately started to kneel pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and wants to deepen the understanding of the fact that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he ought to know [it], for he stood before Tigers before face to face, saying,</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep when sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the King of the Bustles appeared. he immediately sat down, we looked at us and he stares through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">"" "to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo" "" "I click for conservation" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepalese nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to make pictures of vipers in the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could take pictures of a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Many parts of India avoid women with the utmost care to pronounce the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead, they use a pronoun or say" "" "father of my child." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that due to social pressure they respect the husband, as well as the fear of the consequences they should despise the norm, to preserve this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state of Odisha by a pseudo-court and rejected by her family and the village community after having appealed to a married relative with her name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives also is not to be called by the name, is widespread among men too. however, they have far less rebukes to fear, if any, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, came to a unique club and became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of # Khelbadal's campaign, which is operated by the Community of Video Volunteers and is committed to the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to expose practices such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and leads these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion round was of women who did not mention their husbands at the name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which the women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to speak loudly to the names of their husbands is a custom that they all have to maintain and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini believes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not stop this is regarded as deceitful as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband on the name, wanted to try out at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said that I should call him now by his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started their first debating club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchate" before. some believed it was a good thing because it meant that younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked all," "" "If we cannot tell the names of our husbands, but they can call us what they want, does it mean they don't respect us?" ""</seg>

<seg id="1500">"" "" "" "some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," "" "said Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking a centuries-old tradition in which married women could never speak out the name of their husbands." ""</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she could only kiss in front of herself during the whole exercise; another decided to release the complete frustration against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the adrenalin rush about having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands at home.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the following days Rohini received numerous reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put into her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in jeopardy.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the zinnoberred dot on the forehead that indicates marriage:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the zinod red dot if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped completely, but think they are now in a better position to choose to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip to every debating club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear what could hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, such as our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say some things loudly, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only carried saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most people this is okay, but some wanted to wear a Salm-Kurta, a wide shirt over a pair of trousers; they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code, morality connected with saris and much more, Rohini smuggled their own couple of curritas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round, so that the women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will manage it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have made only small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women rehearsed it a few times, but then stopped telling her husband's name.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, make it even more, but only if they are alone and do not have other members of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the names of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like haggling over more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of abduction of bald persons for organ trafficking, presumably for disbelievers, is worried by the police of ZambÃ©zia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometres from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and some of the organs were taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently they confessed that the bodies of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi are used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The police spokesman of ZambÃ©zia of the BBC declared that the head of a man of a bald man could bring gold or bring wealth.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on men of bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN 2016 carried out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in neighbouring Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to combat these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Ukombe Weya lives in the town of Maputo.</seg>
<seg id="1595">He warned those who plan to travel to the country:</seg>
<seg id="1596">Attention to kahle men who travel to Mozambique are target of ritual attacks, warned the Muslim police following the latest killings of three bald men due to their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange, where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hussene Algy Adamo, student and resident of the city of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police are already following the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and assassination of bald-headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of ZambÃ©zia, for supposedly unbelieving rituals, has given cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, this also attracts the police of the Republic of Mozambique in bettered (PRM), which also indicates that a faith exists according to which the victims in the head might have power, the wealth generation.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days, three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">On Facebook, Angela Ferreira Samantha shared the chronicle of the bloggers' poor Snaippa, who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique:</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo by Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably just recently made.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version is published under a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer at the end of June.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison for "Subversion" (endangering the state) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that demanded democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China called" "" "an internal affair" "" "and told a spokesman that he considered it" "" "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China still receives calls from the international community, Nobel Prize laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to release or permit him treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has compiled some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">Unified nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">A spokesman, however, refused to comment whether the United Nations should exert pressure to permit treatment to Liu abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende have refused to answer questions about lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that it would ultimately have nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon in China, as exports have largely been blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament passed a resolution on which China was asked to release Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called on China to release Lius as she announced in an explanation on June 30:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to raise all the restrictions of Mr. Liu's wife as well as family members.</seg>

<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources reported in Beijing's news agency Reuters that China had great concerns whether the hustle and bustle around Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada in the United States</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum requested to provide Liu with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to be cared for by his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu's lawyer previously told AFP that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside, including his lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to tell:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and allowing them to persist in exercising these rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="1668">France and France</seg>

<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all treatments he needs, regardless of where. furthermore, his wife and family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France info already reported that the French government would welcome the Liu government in the country, the State Department announced that there is no further information about whether France will eventually take it up.</seg>

<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama and the Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, expressed himself very much in a statement on 28 June around Liu and admitted that many asked him to pray for Liu's well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives it took and for which it was strictly punished would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed the Charter 08 that stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmuiden, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association, the minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of Singapore's only political party because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported Singapore as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has asked whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to "twist logic" in order to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious country, we can say that we are not a country at all.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmuamalgam were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other "normal countries" in view of this, he seemed inevitably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently run by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core point of the topic, the good old lyre shows up from authoritarian rulers who pretend to be Democrats, abandoned the twisted logic as it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end the last week of Shanmuamalgam was given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system, really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He tarnished the corresponding questions with non-answers of rationale kind.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmuamalgam to express his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to what country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmuamalgam would take the effort to clarify this point, provided that he was paid highly to be part of the City Government's government.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his comment on the blog, he points out to the critics that it is necessary to begin reading the entire transcript of the conference so that you can better understand the context of Shanmuamalgam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said Singapore was more" "" "a city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the Singapore elections are so uneven, even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said Singapore was" "" "no country," "" "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmuiden, who as leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very confused about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said, very embarrassed...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmuiden, member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes that really, and is aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review outlines the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Mr. Shanmuiden" "" "believe a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudian speaker?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we will only be considered an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, what country are the sovereign rights of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmuamalgam are of grave importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore do their military service, do they defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must our Prime Minister pay back to invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink HR card?</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop-band that is famous in Thailand has released a music video that parodes the Junta, which in 2014 seized power and, despite its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to reign.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about what regulations his girlfriend does.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not expressly political, the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>

<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially to the situation of the country under the junta rule.</seg>

<seg id="1804">The post-war society only recovered very slowly in East-East Asia, especially in the district of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1805">More than 20 years have passed since the Georgian-abchasm war officially ended, but its scars are still strongly visible in this part of the republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of the northern district in Tkuarchal show striking pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages such as Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharpoava are located in the hydrocarbon basin of Abkhazia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, Central Asia, Georgians and Armenians lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, most of the Russians live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost towns in Abchsia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period, more than 10,000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the district has been 16,000, after barely risen for over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 about 43,000 people lived in this area.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink spectacle frame and golden earrings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel but hundreds of African and Haitian immigrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, says Ms RamÃ­rez, the people are coming in full minibuses and from the top of the coast they begin to cry: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">"" "where are you Mama Africa?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez has received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also been sleeping outside on boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick, they buy them drugs that they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mum Africa is an appropriate nickname for Mrs RamÃ­rez.</seg>

<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." "" "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "" "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitians and Africans often travel together and that Africans already speak to Whatsapp from Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will contact Ms. RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," "" "he answers smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells her guests often send her text messages when they are gone to greet her or to report her about the course of her trip.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the propulsion of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a blind alley leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have recorded migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">It is policeman and found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they experience.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After he lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula come from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children, who wanted to squeeze money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a single parent, offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests again.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the passages, travelers calmly consult their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, most of them from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full, but it is also nostalgic, because of those who went away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she flattens in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair-spots you made an Kundin, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check point for personal communication devices in Xinjiang by Twitter users to make the best possible.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan District of Urumqi received a mobile phone message indicating the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the announcement, it is said that the app" "" "prevents access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">"" "" "" "however, the authorities should also use the app for more than fighting terrorism." ""</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because, shortly after they had installed the app, they exchanged news with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police, the app was able to identify and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and to remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This App for minors will help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate a person's home network or steal them from it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to monitor the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those living in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Media Outlet, based on Twitter, "images from mainland China," published censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen checked the inhabitants indiscriminately whether they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification requires people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use devices intended for elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" also published a Jingwang product description, which highlights that the software can uplift the requirement of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computers and cell phones in Xinjiang are transformed into electronical handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the spread of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All branches of government, government and affiliated organizations, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office when operating their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent Freedom House report, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published an order in a district of Urumqi in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi up to 1 August to register their "personal ID cards, cell phones, external drives, portable hard disks, notebooks and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">"" "the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" "" "terrorist videos" "", "but this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole range of other possible violations, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages."

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emslam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emslam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emslam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors, sometimes he drills to his screen, sometimes to his computer, and back to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his lips spotted with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family was forced to escape from their village in Palestine in which they lived as felahyeen (about: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist confronted by the conservative majority and questioned their old-established views on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rape.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with themes such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics are not only relevant in his hometown Amman, but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his mind, and he can sympathise with the people suffering from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he doesn't admit it openly, he won a special dislike against U.S. foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those trying to survive in war zones has anything to do with his identity as "Palestinian refugees of the second generation" - that is what he calls himself, even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think so because of my own circumstances," "" "says Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so, because I'm a man," "" "while he poured out NescafÃ© in water in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the slips speak lukewarm coffee and the swaths of the Kent cigarette in the nose first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially if you have a look at the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan to drink water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry announced a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontman Hamed Sinno contradicts the country's cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert forecast.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former press spokesperson in the Islamic coalition of Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert had been cancelled "just" because of the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which asks the well-tried legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimates the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to opt for intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement probably should not be simply a shallow rhetoric, but rather reflects an increasingly clear-crystallizing reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib resided traditional sex organs by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently trampled unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they really should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"" "in recent years, the number of" "" "honour killings" "" "has increased in Jordan - unofficial externally." ""</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of volunteers in 2016 reached its peak; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">"" "according to a crime against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can" "" "be detained in prison indefinitely" "", "and for their release many years of bureaucratic expenditure and guarantee by the family are necessary that the woman will not happen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaib's music enjoys great popularity and is well known for not shy away from topics that are long considered taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but acknowledges that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit allusions to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">I was indoctrinated by politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">"" "in a song called" "" "Edward Sa'ed" "", "Hdaib tackles the question of Palestinian identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" "" "Ghareeb" "" "the focus is on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated remarkably often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one, in his words, "can get what you want" - be it belief or unbelief, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone talks in Jordan about the rights of gay and lesbians, and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib interviewed Roya's popular jordan online program to remember that his comments were torn out of context, distorted and censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but streamed was only a processed version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib advertises the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes intolerance against homosexuals does not correspond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who is still remembered today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nudie, who was to work later on behalf of the caliphs, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert has been cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">"" "" "" "in the hashemite kingdom it is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced." ""</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news service held several former members of the Association and members of the Teachers Association, stating that they were critically addressing the problems associated with the corruption in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the concert Hdaibs opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">Jordan has prevented Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that's Hdaib - is made up of slow, thoughtful and internal changes. it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to "experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be approached with the help of music, art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificial types of democracies. at least, he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to rap and therefore also resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman was a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One assumes that it is a variation of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in many parts of Tohokus in August. another theory states that the forts, drums and dancing have been delivered over a thousand years and come from a time when armies of western Japan marched into the north-east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to snap some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can hardly imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition to Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking for the Meguro Gayoen for a long time now: two forts are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # Nebuchafestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of a 18 meter high car was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let's enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Outside appearances and personal care were seldom as important as in this story, as they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from criminality and promote legitimate jobs like the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's main port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic centre of the capital Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other medium- and South American countries - experienced an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the outlandish hairstyles of famous athletes like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to the fact that more and more regular citizens get into the hands of hairdressers who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the hairdressers "competition" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There experts confront each other in order to show who of them can create the eccentric looks as you can see in the following video (more videos on current contests are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and instead of bad advice a training in the hairdresser's art that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and opportunities, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995, we were the only school in the municipality and the district, where we are very proud, because out of love for the children we have built this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love Letters to Guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the article" "" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" "" "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write letters of love to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Isn't it much more important to accommodate people who feel pushed out?</seg>
<seg id="2185">It was precisely this question that the young Colombian activist Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios was no longer head of the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired her to the Cartas por la-liaciÃ³n campaign, encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">It was only recently that their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their share: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government signed a peace treaty with the FARC guerrilla movement, which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Internationally, the signing of the peace contract was so significant that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for its merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But before the Colombian people there is still a long way to talk about genuine reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillas, who lived in illegal camps for many years, were subjected to war rhetoric and carried their arms around the clock, must now be able to integrate themselves into the lives of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, in turn, who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of profound hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take in their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians had to join and help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - who will then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the Letters to Reconciliation was born at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly to Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love, but forget those who need them much more unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plan, he further told us to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent response.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now find their place in society and have to build a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">To date, more than 2,000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the region of Caldono-Cauca on March 19.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp to personally overhaul the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC presented themselves as they had done before to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between," said the political science student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the province of Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of the guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go, because beside him on the bed was a MGL pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I still spoke to him and said," "" "Hello, what do they do?" "" "he answered," "" "I answer a letter someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never before in my life someone wrote something so beautiful, so I answer." "" "then suddenly tears ran over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the grenade launcher.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war, it was a pity for all the years to be the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before starvation. "I never thought that anyone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the first time, students and some leaders of the FARC came together to form a panel discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already a war and the FARC was already acting in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the FARC leaders declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice done by the State to the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to making society more equitable in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "" "" "the aim of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing these people who had never heard hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hated people with beautiful feelings, who were turned around by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and have done so much harm, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, Archbishop of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were prophesied that after disarming, peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to resort to arms, to stand up and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC now focus on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in Nowaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who arrested suspicious queer men and put them in secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a Transwoman, was born in Grozny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Since her childhood she felt that she was actually a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, which is why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chechens had learned of the gender equality of their landlady, the hunt for Sabrina was opened.</seg>
<seg id="2254">For fear of her life, she moved to the USA in the end.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working as a volunteer in a human rights organization.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a transwoman who was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it all over the Internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no more men in Chechnya who can remove this disgrace?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos from my documents went round the WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was doing a few shopping bags from my car's back seat, I heard a male voice saying, "Here's a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "" "how long do you want to dishonest the family, you cry?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and eventually woke up in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had got everything and started screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: what kind of nurse were you laid in - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am thankful to him that he has been respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote to me - relatives, strangers, some perfectly unknowns.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya to prove that all was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They presented absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by acting on the top without going through the streets; others wanted me to appear in Grozny on the official television and say that I had not changed my gender, that everything was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have granule size C - what should I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world that has humiliated not only your family, but the entire republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you, because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">It was too much for my mother and she laid a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbors came and rescued them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time, I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window was a car filled with dark windows and a plate of 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After passing it for the third time, I realized that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons, I don't want to reveal their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registering myself, without notice, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe you're security, just because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know already in which hotel you are stuck. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it to you: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was indeed my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we do not talk about gender equality, this is a taboo topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements are still in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I really try to look at the person she recalls from her past - that is, my masculine form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: last week I submitted a report to Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For me, I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who saved one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that no people were arrested and tortured during Ramadan, but also that all the end of Ramadan was barely able to wait, and he did not finish a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely, they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">With this I mean, they probably charge the relatives, they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand a proof that the so-called "honor" has been experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still being detained in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend told me that there weren't too many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, above all, those who have no rich relatives or who have been left by their relatives in order to present themselves to Kadyrows's judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can be presented later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "If they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim that they have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people had not simply disappeared, they were deliberately submerged in order to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them with them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, that person was himself when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports so far. however, we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"" "do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called" "" "non-traditional" "" "orientation have already taken place in the past?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known in quite Grozny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">Seriously!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was considered, I had never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer then than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia initially wanted to bring us to the" "" "civilisation" "", "but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored eyelashes, bore tube jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia has never bent me even a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian Theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"" "in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that means:" "" "don't worry about the misfortune of another." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never offended me, never hunted and never struck me.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long was this time of grace?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long before Kadyrow stepped on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began to speak about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not speak about us per se, but primarily about women's behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - one could sense how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had previously laughed and laughed at once looked at you with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time, I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the Republic constantly worsened.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity are you going to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organise teacups, gatherings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have any cents for it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I apperated refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens who want to sign up with foam in front of the mouth that there are no gays with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">"" "the rodents have which ones, the Russians have which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet they exist - but" "" "not in Chechnya" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear something.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men here from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Know, many think of transition to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different kinds of sensation to be precise, different attitudes of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I will be so personally here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahraz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">There has been a strong rise in suicide since the last few months.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with approval.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The incineration of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran that is shaped by poverty and unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, so Ahwazi's human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors were unable to do anything.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide which occurred in August within the Arabic Ahwazi minority, and activists on the spot warn that more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family-fathers who felt helpless and unable to feed their families because of the prosecution by the Iranian government, and to pursue a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffering from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, where most of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the local Arab population to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and in 1925 took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the native population only gets little of that wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated illnesses, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically denies the Ahwazi Arabs working in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a large number of dams to divert the waters from the Arab areas to the Persian regions, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to aggravate the devastation caused by drought, and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi people rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian General Director for Cooperatives, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% of secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"" "a" "" "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the mind of national resistance" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist, resident in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination, led to a "high rise" of the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">"" "" "" "the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:" ""</seg>
<seg id="2424">Because functionaries and institutions do not prefer to hire Arab workers, local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance among young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their name and surname to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone the speech of Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi have to endure, human rights activists kill alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is avoidable.</seg>

<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. released under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement authored by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the AfrofÃ©minas website. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves as an intersectional feminists - react with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminine * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, despite the same education, women still earn less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come across a glass ceiling before or later in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on sex is still spreading across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and three times below.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I come to speak on skin color, on racism, on black Cis women, black women in the LGBTIQ community or black women from the Diaspora; if I mention the way we have always been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and out of the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Yet all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift up their voices and sing" Kumbaya, my Lord "to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to say that there is an institutionalised form of racist violence in addition to sexualised violence, which we are exposed to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin less earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background often referred to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women are exposed to a higher risk in black spheres and women with a migration background to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men in any skin color the same rights; on the other hand, I can not associate myself as a black woman who refuses to consider injustices in her mind, which refers both to sex as well as to the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sojourner complained in her speech in 1851: "am I not a woman?" and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical sense a dehumanized and marginalized being.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups who also by cultural appropriation absorb our customs and customs to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping skin color and gender. for some of them will continue to hold the importance of black women for the feminist movement dead, no matter how many black women try to instruct them for a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and differentiate themselves from white feminism, the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to get rid of feminism and join the movement of Womanismus, which was launched for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of using me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women in accordance with our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womans: Reclaiming to defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can in this way create spaces where they are completely safe and in which the cultural, mental, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform themselves about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement that the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures, because I exist in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flower in an environment where my life is neither bypassed nor ignored nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most names have been modified to protect affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissar said Ada BÃ¡ez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had become violent against her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship a little time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman showed Balbuena due to ill-treatment, the acute ad of Ada BÃ¡ez also did nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman returned her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women ever make an ad, they generally do not receive support from the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to being victims of violence must be reported to the law enforcement authorities at all.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Inhalt1 beats and statistics 2 Invisible mistreatments and a legal system that has nothing subnimm3 Paraguays laws: good approach, deficient implementation strokes and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to find out how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for gender questions at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a social science research institute in Paraguay. "there are various indications and reports that, however, do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The numbers available, however, are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the District Attorney Office filed a total of 9600 advertisements for domestic violence. 70% of them were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the advertisements in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the Peace Counts. 86% of women's advertisements were also here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women said that they were mistreated physically, 55% of women spoke of mental mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics, however, do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan women's minister, Ana Baiardi, few of these crimes are actually shown. "on every woman who is refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, there are 9 women who do not.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "on every woman who is refunded for physical abuse, two women who do not do so," "" "she explained at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's suicide in Paraguay is not a criminal offence, prosecution authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016, journalists included at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The co-ordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a judicial system that doesn't underline anything</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez became the firm girlfriend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the name of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then she continued. this was to regret it forever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years she suffered the mental violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most appreciable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">"" "" "" "I never thought I would be a victim of abuse." ""</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that this only happens to women who are too subservient because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their posts, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he ever lifted his hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen from Carlos for such a long time and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who is not from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner abused them.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"" "Victoria is a member of the network Yo te Creo (" "" "I believe you" "" ") that consists of women who are all in some way victims of abuse." ""</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorian's case everything started with mental mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's advertisements with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She introduced a process against her former partner who developed into an unmanageable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguays laws: good approach, lack of implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"" "" "" "in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good, but not applied." ""</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a draft bill was discussed at the Paraguayan parliament, which became known under the hashtag # PorEllas (# fÃ¼rst).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the # NiUnaMenos movement are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">"" "" "" "the original bill of the law stipulates that it must be explained and harshly punishable by the fact that it is the case in neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2532">"" "" "" "so the text of the law has been changed in some respects to also gain members for the law, who feared that the way for the decriminalisation of abortion would be banned, which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill envisaged the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that the victims of violence must carry on themselves, if they simply provide an ad and would like to obtain a secure accommodation, to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as a part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">A rethink must take place here, so that violence is no longer seen as a normal thing.</seg>
<seg id="2537">"" "" "" "those who are silent in view of these facts are complicit and contributes to the fact that the offenders will get away." ""</seg>
<seg id="2538">"" "" "" "we have to pay so long that ill treatment is no longer considered normal." ""</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. before, parts of the law had been altered, including a passage that the partners called in cases of domestic violence to reconcile.</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions on the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victim again.</seg>
<seg id="2542">However, the cancellation of the words "gender," "political violence" and "sexual harassment" from parts of the law, however, is regarded as a major setback.</seg>

<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the Mexican authorities closed the independent Arab-language newspaper Azamn due to their coverage of corruption in the sultanate.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, representation takes place with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on-site: on the one hand, many medicines and vaccines are missing in the global healthcare system, which cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious effects in Africa's poorest countries than elsewhere, and lack of investment for research into these diseases is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, the research carried out by African scientists is helping to build own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Center for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, when the AIDS epidemic showed a serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for studying in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a Postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he researched the HIV virus himself before deciding to go back home to support the Serbian healthcare system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstanding of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Serbian National Programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I am currently starting a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GWS: what do you think are the key current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no fundamental research here. we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">That has to change, otherwise we will always remain receivers, rather than being Macher.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not suitable for use in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GWS: where does funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are promoted differently well.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GWS: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GWS: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">O: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I saw great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special scientific training, beginning at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, exploration of space, healthcare (non-communicable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa versus Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it's the limited speed, things to do, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that are challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">"" "the system that magazines produce articles only against payment (the so-called" "" "Paywall" "" ") also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research." ""</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has already been breeding a salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 sorts, such as Outshue, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own ingenuity and the question of how many types of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain and carrot varieties. based on this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts for food security are concerned about the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton is still breeding a salad, but it takes longer, since his work is more and more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is like a boulder lying in a river, around which I must be paddled." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do it now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that these patents go too far on salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand trial, nobody can breed a new type of lettuce because all the features are already patented. "he continues to make as good as possible and tries to breed those traits he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very cautious and endeavours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">"" "he has also joined a movement that is becoming increasingly bigger in the US and all over the world: open source Breeding (" "" "open source" "" "breeding)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red tubular salad of the Outrageous variety in the "greenhouse" of the station. it tests whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for open-source seed) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It has been launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, shortly called Ossi, US breeders can agree that others can freely use the seeds bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean, however, that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open source" breeders allow only others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties, and not to immediately send it out - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Dark views of the sea</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi CEO Jack Kloppenburg, control of seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to it, seeds play a role in larger cohesion such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent growers would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">"" "Kloppenburg points out that the" "" "open-source" "" "movement does not work with genetically modified plants." ""</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need to take control of seeds in the global agriculture industry, whose recent examples are the mergers of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer, which is, for example, offered on farmers markets, should also know that the manner in which this vegetable is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to continuing to make their seeds available free of charge. thus, their approach is in contrast to patent seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the ever increasing intellectual property rights to plant material, which is thus always available.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all of the Carrot characteristics are protected as intellectual property, making it either not or difficult to use for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2659">Such estimates do not exist for other plants, but experts like Luby suggest that large-scale planted plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown so that they have specific desirable traits - from those that have improved their taste or colour to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and can withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant characteristics point out that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing for more and more patents. genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since changing conditions by climate change are much less predictable.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail Monsanto realizes Carly Scaduto that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and co-operation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "it contradicts, however, that intellectual property advertises other growers, as" "" "patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation." "" "a patent is basically a plan that anyone can follow as soon as the patent has expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Thus, such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes it by providing more material and expertise to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees this: wait 20 years for a patent to run, certainly not promoting innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed on plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders do not have time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">"" "" "" "we want to make farmers easier for farmers." ""</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us to continue using the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant characteristics: "we do not really create the characteristics themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form the plants themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeders in the Oregon and Ossi executive committee, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "he who breeds a variety breeds his own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for their cultivation of large quantities of herbicides, are breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is very opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such as operating in international markets, but smaller than Monsanto), most smaller seed companies manage to survive also without patents - either they reject the patent or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>

<seg id="2681">Morton is also convinced that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks like I'm working with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that are patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalogue, because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties for a few years, "he says." with a patent it is protected for 20 years from competition, which makes it very easy in my opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"" "although the USA seems to be a leader in the" "" "Open Source" "" "breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, carries out an open-source seed program. to preserve the seeds of traditional crops, the centre works with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">"" "it also supports them to come to" "" "Open Source" "" "seeds and sell their own." ""</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organization Agree works on an open-source license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for the breeder differ from country to country, which is why the Ossi obligation cannot simply be one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, has declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable. thus, it advocates the current practice of the European patent office, which permits patents on conventionally bred plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">"" "" "" "however, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line." ""</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organised a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organisations and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the "open source" seed movement and the global trend towards seed patenting.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organization and blog are the latest aims of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist met.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of May 5th, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network posted a statement on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities strongly criticized this step and promised to continue the work and efforts on human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true to its goal of defending freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it has never been as important as it is now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news site Mada Masr, Arabic-speaking edition of the Huffington Post and Qatar-based Al Jazeera network for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organization of the wave of web side barriers to the victim. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for the spread of articles and articles he writes for in Egypt, not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he directed to circumvent the censal apparatus of the Egyptian government, became the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Bloggers made good content as you did, the web will be much more useful than ever before. |</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video how police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada said to the blocking through the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">Blocking blogs is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelietah al-Sisi; and although the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege; An arrest, a attempted murder, unloading at the national Security Council, blocking blogs and any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They have proved that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, though only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post articles in order to circumvent censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now after having locked it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 6 August. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP) including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Also, afte also documented the blocking of providers, through the circumvention of internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of web sites that offered VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering the content that Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is also worsened by the fact that the court decisions are taken behind closed doors, making the Egyptian population no legal basis by which they can proceed against these acts in court.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian army in the Favelas in NiterÃ³i, a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2752">Photo by: Estado Maior (CML) via photos PÃºblicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Day after day, newspapers in all Brazil with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old is shot in school," "Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro," "Dieeves rauben dispensary with military weapons," "President Timer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and air to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation in 2017, the wave of violence in Rio has reached the highest level for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports such as these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">So the newspaper "Extra" published for the detailed coverage of Violence in Rio published the editorial "This is not normal," in which she announced to set up a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now being published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper explains the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc., but what happens from the civilized standard and what happens in Rio will be published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four minute video shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war rubrik in a country that does not recognise the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist told the newspaper that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to disguise the atrocities of the police that only shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">"" "does the term" "" "war" "" "harm more than it is used?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira argues that violence as a "war" argues. according to her opinion, this is a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold accountability to the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and bad planning - as it has shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">As a reminder, the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital.</seg>
<seg id="2775">A Peace march in NiterÃ³i in the state of Rio de Janeiro in honour of the murdered cultural organizer Rafael Location.</seg>

<seg id="2777">"" "Rio de Janeiro as" "" "the most violent place in Brazil" "" "is wrong, according to CecÃ­lia:" "" "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil lie in the north and north-east of the country according to statistics from 2015." ""</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "if we look at the Mordrones per state, Rio is in place 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">It is owned by Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, like CecÃ­lia, has been reiterating the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security policy measures also included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), a police unit established by the state of Rio in 2003, whose objective is to capture a Favela by using a massive police station and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases. however, after several years, the UPP has been increasingly under fire after several reports of shamans and repressions against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also involves serious consequences for the people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use resources and ways that are typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "lost bullets."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, fact is that the inhabitants of the Favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week later, police attacked the mountain with the Favela Jacarzinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: a fruit salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer under brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to Siege Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria institutes, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The East Ghouta region, where chemical weapons attack on August 21, 2013, is particularly affected by hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition, based on investigations from the United Nations and other human rights organisations, assume that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege, leading to the fact that local residents are dependent on locally produced or tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through years of blockage, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, as they can plant their own mushrooms as a life-saving food source.</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnida and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms are not part of the traditional food planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian food. however, their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The diversion of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">"" "Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed its relief that it now becomes more and more" "" "becoming known." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2814">To collect money for the initiative, in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Almira, use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to give 125 families knowledge of planting mushrooms, according to Dr. Leila to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 â¬, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo until Monday, 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative relies on generators that keep temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortage, locally produced fuel from plastic will be used to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they started the" "" "mushroom seed production" "" "before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many capital cities in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal last week.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government's last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Brandies were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 explosions that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occurred in PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors the forest areas via satellite imagery, about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of readily combustible wood, like in a vicious circle, spread to the fires of this species.</seg>
<seg id="2855">These problems add to the fact that the website of civil protection from Portugal on October 15 and 16, when citizens were seeking information or attempted to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the people with information: they used their own civil protection data using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer JoÃ£o Pina in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial in this fateful weekend in October that the servers were not able to resist the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed the fires.</seg>

<seg id="2873">In one night in the fall of 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years earlier, a terrible civil war broke out between the various mujahedin groups who had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus, Afghanistan had become a land of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">At that time, Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, sat in the province of Ghazni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even though his mother didn't say that at that time, she knew that she wouldn't see her son for a long time - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">At dawn, the boy should break up.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick it up and bring him to the tugs.</seg>

<seg id="2883">CC-2.0</seg>
<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat, dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban, and many Hazara suddenly felt protective.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred for the Hazara, came closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself again in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal pit. the work was hard and made him ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wages, and went to Iran. once again he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars, who were heavier than himself in order to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, like today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating. we hung Nylon in front of the open windows so that we wouldn't freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Ashark left his life without paperwork in Iran and made ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Asharaf was homeless, walking alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high ratings. however, it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers are found in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the large majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres" "". "these are improvised institutions in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially have submitted an application for asylum - which can still apply for months after the registration of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who do not have money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So there was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his untamed lifestyles helped Ashark to free himself from these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having made various work in the construction industry for several years, Ashark put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis Success Story is now the subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In 2017, the film received the Venice City Award, which was presented for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for employers in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">"" "" "" "much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles." ""</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates around 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, a number of Afghans have emerged, including dressings, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant is told by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts the history of their trip to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the Restaurant Peace & amp in Padua; Spice and also behind the Pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a Sushi Restaurant in Rome also have Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Asharafs aims to reach far beyond the Italian restaurant trade and retail trade and aim back to the country that he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are also opportunities," says Ashark with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I am planning a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Asharaf also forges plans for opening a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packing and conservation techniques." "" "so they can sell their harvest surplus on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but at the end stand stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey himself. now, he also wants to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>

<seg id="2929">He reported on the evacuation of the camp of Raba el Adaweya in Cairo, protesting against the decomposition of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen report is an international snapshot showing challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">"" "" "" "the Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that allows users to use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registering with a government authority." ""</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to register to make use of the social networks, register within six months after a successful lawsuit on the authority's website stating their full name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who failed this step could be sentenced to six months imprisonment or the trimming of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was promoted by sixty members of the Parliament, is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "in May, another member of the Parliament presented a proposal in which harder punishments for the insult of the President or a senior official would be introduced." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the law of law, however, such action would be punished with prison and fines, as well as legal experts from the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the convicted.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "moreover, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who took photos on 13 August 2013 when he took photos against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of elected President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan waited, like more than 700 protesters arrested at the same incident, four years in jail on a court date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his hearing was postponed to 20 May, because the prison administration failed to bring the accused to the court room according to human rights groups.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan poses death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, headlight of e.g. arms, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a Criminal Court in Giza cleared the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were charged with their coverage of pro-Morsi sitting blockade on Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the penalties of journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the aforementioned incident, from 25 years to five years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists stop digested documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">The plan comes from the President of the Republic who, according to the plan, explicitly supports a controversial bill of law, which would ensure businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption indicted officer Amnesty, provided that all funds returned unlawfully.</seg>
<seg id="2949">This document, published on 21 April on Nawaat's website, sheds light on how the presidential plans look to support the Laws of the Laws.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia rejected the mention of his sources stating article 11 of the Tunisian press code, which assures journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he joined the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to present their identification?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to the new rules of the National Council of People's Republic of China, social media users in China need permission before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">It is also stated in the rules that registration will be required with the full real name.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts suggest that the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks is to be achieved. it is unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Do we see ourselves in "WeChat?"</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging App WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Roscomnadzor, WeChat had to register as" "" "organiser of information broadening" "" "at the provincial government." ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a law from 2014, thanks to which the Russian government performs a list of online services that organize the "publication of information." the law also allows the government to make said services to remove content and to force it upon request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites currently include websites such as Vkontakte and Odnoclassiniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the image board 2.ch.hk, email service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>

<seg id="2968">Following this week's document, the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation on increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor utilities that decode data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal, but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation continues until May 19. reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
