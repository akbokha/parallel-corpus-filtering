that is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
long before anyone heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the NSA had illeg@@ ally listened to tel@@ eph@@ ones of Americans .
but there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA literally over@@ turned Iran into a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter didn &apos;t like at all ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years the government has determined against Ris@@ en and asked him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to judge whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitution , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave ones they reveal .
so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to jail .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going into prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something exceptional happened .
suddenly , although they believed for years that it was essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to Ris@@ en .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , re@@ porters and sources can hide more and less .
instead of spl@@ itting and ris@@ king asser@@ tions , this could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , are secretly worried about his telep@@ hon@@ y ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , his credit , and even travel links with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ t and crack .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , the judi@@ ciary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers went to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment because the government has more and more possibilities to spy out all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as technology allows government to b@@ ypass the rights of re@@ porters , the press can use technologies to better protect their sources .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and indeed , they can do so from the moment in which they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today there is communication software that didn &apos;t exist yet , when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source release system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , who has been developed and developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of sending an email , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can no longer proc@@ ure information secret , and many of the information it would require would not be available from the outset .
Sec@@ ure@@ Any@@ where , however , is only a small part of the whole in order to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new es@@ pi@@ onage technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se all of us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to show mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot; &quot; &quot;
who wants to know about ab@@ norm@@ alities in the supply of soldiers and wants to report from over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environment worker who strikes alarm for contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall In@@ sider that warns us of the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; This week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents from the resident law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a saying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous enterprise . can you set up this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of news , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has let@@ ter@@ heads in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a $ 2 billion mark leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others who are nervous about the next release , and on the next revealed documents .
now it sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
it seems we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should that happen to us ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that affects all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenomen@@ al .
in the whole world , media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and obsc@@ ure their wealth -- something we &apos;ve been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem very confusing to this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ ry@@ osh@@ ka doll .
so one has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who lies behind these things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what it is . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
presumably because there were no prominent Americans so far who came to this scandal in these revelations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , in some US states you need less information to provide less information to form a company than to get a library card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of in@@ transparency in the USA allows employees of school districts to rip off school@@ children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sc@@ amm@@ ers have allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off especially vulnerable ears .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here with Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring susp@@ icious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really shocked us that all of us up to a lawyer made suggestions on how he could transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian , involved in a scandal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and instability .
and to deal with this , we need to change the rules of the game .
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult .
this may sound very glo@@ omy as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist I see quite a lot to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have seen an increase in transparency , which concerns the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the issue attracted political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU registers in central registers at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind here .
representatives of both parties introduced a draft law in both parliament chambers , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy that get up and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of in@@ transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together we can finally end the in@@ transparency , which now enables this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story of how I was ab@@ duc@@ ted and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after I finished my design studies I made a back@@ yard sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da remained standing and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my art@@ works .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . after that he would go to the Peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it got late . I became tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he said he would go to the Peace Corps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land ab@@ duc@@ ted in the boot of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; u@@ h , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at night I lay in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I get into it ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of bed , sne@@ aking at toe tips to the door , and locked my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art that he had purchased from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my perspective .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ?
to house people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress .
let us make a time leap , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate draws and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could make something about it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including a mattress and breakfast each morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we created a website and thus founded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Air@@ bed and Breakfast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#91; Air@@ bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three happy guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floors for 20 dollars .
they found it super , and we too .
I am sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I stopped .
had we just discovered that we were at the same time finding new friends and paying our rent ?
things came into the roll .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if one could make it a business concept .
so we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , bathrooms , the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting .
over the Internet , they can then invite strangers to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
nobody who is still with comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we as children learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you are contempl@@ ating the things that you can do well . we could design .
at the Kunst@@ akademie , we learned that design is much more than just look and feel - it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design do something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we strive for .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked cell phone to your left seat .
this soft touch of panic you can sense now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked cell phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most people feel the responsibility .
so most of the guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just like that , who actually has Al G@@ ores mobile phones now ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he is chann@@ eling for the president &apos;s office ?
you can now return the cell phones .
they have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail on this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name ; if he had told where he came from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you would have 150 assessments that all say : &quot; he can hold very well un@@ locked cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to release your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was hard for the people to leave negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had left their jud@@ gements before placing them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are in terms of age and place of residence .
little surprisingly , we trust the people most that are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting if you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case through assessments .
if you have less than three evaluations , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation stands out common@@ alities .
so the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you won &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one tells too much , for example , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is rather not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; Great artwork in your apartment ! I make vacation with my family . &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against foreigners .
what we did not reck@@ on was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down those prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a requirement that had not been covered before .
for us the business is running very well .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who did not allow parties to celebrate parties or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have guests standing in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , over 123 million spent nights only had a fraction of a problem .
for people are tru@@ sting one another .
if trust works , wonderful things can arise .
one of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his judgement :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attack because of se@@ dent@@ ary activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives even though they don &apos;t know them properly .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital if you die and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books past .
they let you stay even longer without calculating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay works .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled over this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is about economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now it &apos;s just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people place a part of themselves openly , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , this is comparable to Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travel would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if in any place you visit , a group there would have to wait to fill a thoroughly and show one at a tavern tour that has never been heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would create apartments from scratch ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would take the thought of a common share ?
I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces owned by the government ,
were now offered to residents . students who were looking for a stay ,
were taught to people whose children were moved out . incub@@ ator programs were launched ,
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 8@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be so crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ invent the wheel .
there was a warm hospitality even before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did our work just work ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find it amaz@@ ingly ,
down@@ right overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da runs past me .
of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what design we can use in the near future .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the airport security check .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media are people who look like me .
a study found that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met Muslims , it is great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born like that .
I decided to do that .
when I was 17 years old , I made the decision to ou@@ te myself .
no , not as a hom@@ osexual man , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a declaration of independence for me , in contrast to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted pas@@ sively the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Koran .
I read it , thought after , questioned , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was confident and slow aband@@ on@@ ment that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Koran .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes makes me cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet loves you somehow ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and began , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was sitting in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breaking News &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew into buildings , people jumped out of the buildings .
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock quickly turned into indignation .
why should one do such a thing ?
I changed the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... , &quot; Eastern origin ... &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; ... gr@@ ind@@ ingly Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
it is not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u the actions of others turned me into a suspect .
on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move into a new city and start the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I beha@@ ved -- as we went silent -- as deep as it went into my seat , and I was the first time afraid to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be vi@@ gil@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rem@@ ember in well @-@ lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday this week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings began : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people that were held for Muslims , free up and beating .
there were really burns hits on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have put the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are tough .
today , we can actually say people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the USA .
the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a malign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are fu@@ tile because the question is wrong .
Muslims , like all other Americans , are not a tumour in the body of the United States , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympics .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America more secure ?
there might be a few parking spots free but not stopping the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque guides people to look more tolerant towards people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
and like me a head of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told , people are actually not ra@@ dic@@ alized in mos@@ ques .
they are ra@@ dic@@ alized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
during the ra@@ dic@@ alization process , one has found that he begins online . first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family , so that the extrem@@ ist group can make a bra@@ in@@ washing , which causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or by faith .
if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we have to stop people to go to the mosque .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imagination when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like K@@ u @-@ K@@ lux Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; holy book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when you look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scriptures &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality , which makes them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . each minister , with whom she had spoken , brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her anger , she was a main target for instrument@@ alizing extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution .
this Ima@@ m re @-@ established the connection with God and its community .
instead of bl@@ aming her for her anger , he showed her constructive ways of a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does ordinary Americans work ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show that if we fear , at least three things happen .
we are more accepting an author@@ itarian government system , conformity , and prejudi@@ ce .
a study shows that if test persons submit news in which negative about Muslims were reported , they rather agree military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look when the mood against Muslims pushed upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
when assign@@ ing collective guilt , it is not just about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was at the dental faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when has my brother become such a sav@@ age young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Craig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who visited her in the afternoon .
he shot De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the start .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mosque or were we safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely .
we chose the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we were silent , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took it out , drew my shoes , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw allowed me to stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , for half of them were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , athei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who had come not to attack us , but to assist us .
at this moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had brought courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who think that we are better than those .
thank you .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who might say that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , working in a clas@@ sy think tank , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am so ordinary as it is allowed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you look at Muslims around the world , and I did this with the largest study of Muslims all over the world , people want ordinary things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
if people like an exception appear to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about becoming a billion dollar business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial dr@@ ones .
an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRA@@ C Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre @-@ high tower of 1 500 bricks in front of the public before the air @-@ packing system in France . some years ago they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting , air@@ planes reach high speed and acceleration in tigh@@ test spaces .
you can also build self @-@ winding structures .
they have learned to wear loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of possible in an autonomous flight .
in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it must be collectively known where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; started &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the highest level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flight device trying to beat two flies with a flap .
like other starter pilots , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
in contrast to most starter motors it can float , and therefore has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the flight unit , no matter what position , achieves the optimum position and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often face fundamental abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter .
such a question would be , for example , what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts that meet to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled aircraft that had only two mov@@ able parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simple remote control unit . it was invented recently .
it only has a moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no valves , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , in the inner life a lot happens so that it can fly stable , and move in the room everywhere .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear starter . to get it to fly , I have to throw it right .
the odds of throwing it right if everyone is watching is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
when the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in cont@@ ent@@ ment , this machine is here , the omni@@ bus with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is very symmet@@ rical .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
as a result , he receives the extraordinary ability ,
move in space in all directions , no matter which direction it rot@@ ates or even rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some are imagin@@ able in models , the rest is learned directly during flying .
let &apos;s look at that .
if flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate two prop@@ ellers .
this turns clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise direction .
when you build them together they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
if something goes wrong - a motor or prop@@ eller falls out , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further , even if limited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will demonstrate this by making half of the plane f@@ light@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercially available micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly secure machine on the ground would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology .
for guys like us , wages are in development and creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and ench@@ ant@@ ment our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you .
three billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cled around each other in a very distant galax@@ y , so the mass of three suns transformed into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
for this short moment they lit bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not use their energy in the form of light .
finally we speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us first arrange the events tempor@@ ally .
more than 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell life was created on Earth .
since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands for us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from the Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser det@@ ectors to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which originate through col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most people thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognised her as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the Laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves @-@ observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be significantly improved , which significantly improved recognition performance .
therefore it is now called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ro@@ using the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes through the earth .
they went through you and me
and through the detector too .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
and the par@@ ting of my father @-@ to @-@ death father .
basically , that was the fruits of my life .
AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has studied gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes for 23 years and their through observ@@ atories like lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cr@@ ushing in the fabric of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and into the other .
instruc@@ tional teachers in courses for rel@@ ativity theory often perform a really sil@@ ly dance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and stretched by the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by a 1 . therefore , one explained the Lig@@ o staff to be mad .
with a five @-@ kilometre @-@ long laser detector , and that is already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucleus . this is grot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gravity
&quot; &quot; &quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite handy , because so you can create a picture or a map of things by taking the light around you from several points .
with sounds , that is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually , impossible to produce a picture of things that are particularly significant to you :
for example , your child &apos;s face .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume in order to close the story behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now just Alice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts her . &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can &apos;t make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o , the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can hear the universe literally .
to listen to the gravity , about the collision of two black holes can tell us about the collision between two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p !
if the two bodies rotate very quickly , you can hear the same chir@@ p with an additional key change . this sounds like the W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , em@@ bodied in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- hears Lig@@ o the following : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ des noise &#93; somebody who knows what he needs to hear recognize this as a noise of -- SH : ... two black holes with a 30 @-@ fold solar mass , that spin around as fast as the rods of your sha@@ ker .
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve around one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we have heard it .
therein lies the permanent importance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves an entirely new way to researching the universe as it was never possible before .
on this path we can listen to the all and hear the invisible .
much in All we can - practically or basically -- not see .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about the universe .
however , the exciting physical processes occur at the core , which lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never go through because these are opa@@ que .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them since the Big B@@ ang is obsc@@ ured by his own light .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and most importantly , I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first c@@ asser@@ ole we had not expected .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , as Lig@@ o ob@@ serves them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are , so to speak , the sau@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different view of the events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately also how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as bold as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and All .
for what could be nic@@ er than listening to the Big B@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of big dreams .
you dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a year I would say to all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be on TV live ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid of , removed my fear .
my fear to stop talking , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes , which changed my life deeply , to an un@@ expectedly kind . it started with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three unbelievable daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . Emer@@ son , the smallest one , calls all the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the South .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my be@@ ak cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
from then on I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very proud .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , our family .
but it also has an astonishing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; sa@@ wing to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think things out , stir you up to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I produce television .
I make TV , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are at the same time in production .
every program offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the budget for an episode of a television channel can be between three and six million dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days with four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programs simultaneously : 24 episodes : grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : 1 , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours Television ,
350 million dollars for one season .
in America , my TV series run on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I created myself , and not just produced , so still overhead . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire burning around the world .
do you know who else does it ?
nobody , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you , that all of you who work so hard , whether you run a company , a country or a class@@ rooms , take a business or a household , take me seriously when I speak of work so that you understand that I &apos;m not just around the computer and imagin@@ ative , and it is true when I say : I understand that it doesn &apos;t dream of dreaming .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I deep@@ en my work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
it is as if I set up troops , as I painted on a canvas .
as a bear@@ er of a high sound , I run a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love working .
it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . and the best part is the bu@@ zz .
there is such a change in me when the work is working well .
a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy street , I could go on it forever .
many people assume that when I tell them the sums of money , I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t get me wrong , that &apos;s what she is doing .
but the bu@@ zz -- when I began working with television production when I began working and working and working , creating , creating and working together , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy .
the bu@@ zz is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sw@@ amp , then you can &apos;t strive differently than on size .
the feeling of not being able to do otherwise than to strive for size , no matter what price .
this is called the bu@@ zz .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it &apos;s called genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I only know that I love the bu@@ zz .
I just want to tell you that I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more overl@@ apping boundaries , the more work there is , the more things at the same time , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon , I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the sw@@ amp , the sw@@ amp , the bu@@ zz .
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the bu@@ zz . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I just this bu@@ zz ?
and then the bu@@ zz stopped .
revised , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burnt out .
the bu@@ zz stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their m@@ um is a single institute .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the bu@@ zz stopped .
the bu@@ zz of the engine st@@ amped .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was out .
the bu@@ zz did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
I did the same things as usual : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours days , re@@ worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ating , a titanium does not sleep , does not give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ mons .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a showcase Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the bu@@ zz I was .
so what do you do when what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Today , stupid author Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you do , you do , you love what you are doing , being a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives you the bu@@ zz when you already knew the sw@@ amp when the bu@@ zz stopped , who is it then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way outside , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no when two things become aware of me :
first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she doesn &apos;t call anyone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did this happen ?
I miss it when I &apos;m a Titan and mo@@ urn my sw@@ amp , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding , because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of sum@@ mons , I can do nothing except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the land I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and moist kis@@ ses , tender voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons , and the song in which it is released , or whatever the girl in &quot; Die Eis@@ köni@@ gin &quot; release .
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something inside me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in .
and that doesn &apos;t immediately , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the sw@@ amp comes back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the bu@@ zz , but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel like I know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the bu@@ zz , the working @-@ sum , the titanium @-@ hum@@ ming , that &apos;s just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself with the aid of broad@@ casts and TV @-@ hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the bu@@ zz is not a force and it is not working @-@ specific .
it depends on the pleasure .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on love .
the bu@@ zz is the current that comes from the lust of life .
the real bu@@ zz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real bu@@ zz ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words to me , for what God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this to a fixed rule , so that I can free myself from any debt as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the hum@@ ming again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play is not as good as working . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer to work at work than at home .
this admission is painful , because what a person prefers to work than to be home ?
well , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
we walk around in the garden , front and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst in soap bubbles .
I mostly feel stiff , absent and confused .
I always take my mobile phone .
but it is OK .
my children show me how to live , and the bu@@ zz of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we stop playing ?
you can also ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you think me na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dreaming .
you are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or cookie replaces me .
and talk my teen@@ ie @-@ daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , more needs not .
everyone can pick up for 15 minutes , even on a bad mood !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children complete .
but 15 minutes are possible !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the bu@@ zz , to have a place for peace .
it is not about playing with our own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and save it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I will fail and I won . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training when I wanted to sur@@ pass more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a bit , why not treat yourself for 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong with it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the bu@@ zz , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my bu@@ zz .
the tot@@ ality of life .
the bu@@ zz of love .
the bu@@ zz of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so thankful for that .
it &apos;s sn@@ u@@ ff to me that I am a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a titanium before going to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fires burn still .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz . the land I created , the marathon , I run , the troops , the linen walls , the high sound , the sw@@ amp , the sw@@ amp , the other , the right hum@@ ming : the bu@@ zz of life .
the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more this unusual , engaging , bare and new feeling of life spreads in me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sums , the more I know who I am .
I am author . I think things out , I &apos;ll catch you to life .
that is part of the job , which means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have every day to do with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability for self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical procedures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they certainly have one of the best known ones , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep brain stimulation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; in doing so , one im@@ planted an electro@@ de deep in the brain , in order to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons in such a way that the neurological function is improved . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease that suffered from severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
the story started 15 years ago .
at that time I was chief doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they have to imagine that the brain sw@@ ells the brain and increases the cran@@ ial pressure in skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas .
to save life , you have to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure .
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
you have to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and the surroundings to thri@@ ve .
that is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François succeeded .
he saw this under his microscope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you know from biology classes that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can transform into each cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fet@@ us stage , they are responsible for the folding of the brain .
but why do they remain in us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries .
but this is not so safe .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François .
and then mark them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we re @-@ planted them at the sampling table of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re @-@ implant these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re @-@ implant the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we re @-@ planted the cells in a healthy brain and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared as if they were removed again , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury and re @-@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew into mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that were re @-@ planted .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets of one tablet .
they made it very good .
when they reached a stable level of skill , we spent the motor @-@ motor area in the motor cor@@ tex .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could not move their hand anymore .
exactly as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ sed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , as well as with the ape .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached its level of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left side , they see the monkey , who recovered spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now see when we re @-@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that we were also very exciting results .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to implant them in humans .
I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giussani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one has to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass this type of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate and so on .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years will it take for someone to come to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will the authority permit us to start it soon ?
then it is necessary to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients to perform the treatments and assess whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment .
then you need to apply this to a mul@@ tic@@ entr@@ e study .
first you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it &apos;s safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , thank you for your visit to TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them self @-@ evident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to consider them as un@@ changeable .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved dou@@ bt@@ ful that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth , while policy remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy van@@ ishes with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was mis@@ understood to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- should not affect the austerity programs that were realized in Greece .
at that moment , I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends who told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you to an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro Group would be wrong , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and anti @-@ democratic democracy .
for without democracy our societies are mil@@ ked , our future ble@@ ak and our great new technologies are wasted .
on the subject of waste , I would like to point to an interesting contradiction which is currently threatening our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin @-@ peak parad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain that casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the debt mountain ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which is one of the wealthy savers and corporations , who , however , are too anxious to invest there where it would be productive and bring income with which they would be able to wear the debt mountain and also produce all the things humanity needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars were invested in the US , in England and in the euro@@ zone , in all the prosperity producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , rails , equipment and so on and so on .
3.@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until we compare it with the 5.@@ 1@@ tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars that were at the same time lying around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did nothing to infl@@ ate the stock markets and raise real estate prices .
thus debts and un@@ productive capital are the twin @-@ tops that are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand , which , as in an endless loop , supports the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which could be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up ,
un@@ intentionally brings about the circumstances leading to the fact that O@@ edi@@ pus kills him .
this is my hatred with capitalism --
his very wa@@ st@@ eful character . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents , and especially to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the rescue of the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue , what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy , of course , included too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
but it would be a mistake to mi@@ tig@@ ate the significance of the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy due to these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive thing in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it was deprived of the working arms , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but was more important and decisive that they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal votes in questions of state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like a candle , which lights very bright , it is burned out quickly .
however , our present liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the toil@@ ing poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which in the end was a stat@@ ute for rulers .
for liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a more democratic zone .
in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , there has been a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two since the time when this separation of politics and economy has begun , and the economy gradually under@@ mines politics and em@@ powers it .
are you wondering why the politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because these days one can be in the government and still not in power , because the power has mig@@ rated from politics to the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hatred with capitalism .
if you think about it , it &apos;s about like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that have dec@@ im@@ ated so sustain@@ ably the animals from which it feeds itself , that they are star@@ ved at the end .
it is similar to the economy that has can@@ ni@@ zed politics so far that it is har@@ ming itself by the self @-@ created economic crisis . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , inequality falls , the overall economic demand falls , and the managing directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their businesses .
the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the twin @-@ tops , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind .
if that is true , it is obvious that we need to bring together politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; retains control , just as in ancient Athens , except for the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the toil@@ ing poor only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new types of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers by automation and robots .
the problem is , so long economy and politics are separate areas , autom@@ ating the twin tops to become higher , wa@@ sting waste , and deeper social conflicts , like it -- very soon , as I believe -- will come in countries like China .
so we need to re@@ structure the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we democrati@@ ze the re@@ unified sector , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear like a documentation .
the question is not , therefore , whether capitalism will survive the technical gains that it has produced .
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is super@@ se@@ ded by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; Matrix , &quot; or something similar to that of society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; in which machines are serving humans and humans spend their energy in exploring the universe , or indulge in a high @-@ tech version of ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long discussions the sense of life .
I think we must be optimistic .
so what would it do , how could it look like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples .
in the area of companies : please introduce a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital will follow you from one job to another , from one company to another , and the company -- no matter in which one is working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all revenues originate from capital and from revenues and the concept of wage labor is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction more between those who belong to the companies , but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but who do not belong to them . no more exchange between capital and labour , no gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no up@@ lifting twin @-@ tops .
in the area of global political economy : please introduce yourself in a nut@@ shell that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the Cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time , not the technical means had to be implemented .
today we have them , especially against the background of a unified politics and economy .
the world I describe to you is at the same time liber@@ ating in which she prefers privileged individuals and Marxist , because it is buried by the separation of capital and labour in the tr@@ ash bin of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all else , it is a world in which we can imagine a true democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better .
thank you .
Fr . Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you write yourself in your biography as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything I have just said is relevant then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and the economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers calls &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
through the transfer of this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we are experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
as Ha@@ ye@@ k , that is why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am completely confused .
BG : indeed , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you aren &apos;t confused , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have very clearly stated what you think of the West &apos;s view of China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of democracy .
as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most plays away -- the area of the economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in a sense , if I can say that pro@@ voc@@ ative , China resembles the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that &apos;s a mistake historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical of the democratic development .
what one can observe in China is similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now preten@@ ding to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ acks of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many people are curious about your experiences as the finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I sen@@ sed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half @-@ year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ appointing , because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to say goodbye to compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the continued denial that a massive fault line has passed through the euro@@ zone and continues to massi@@ vely threaten the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which was , by the way , the first suggestion that revealed this denial .
right to do . unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , have also voted for denial .
but you know what &apos;s coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to get an economic system that is not viable to live through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ...
if there is a minister of finance or any minister who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he claims he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the request for extending the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the don@@ ors &apos; sides to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they merely wanted to bring our government down , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that slept through the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Troika &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the don@@ or who imposed this policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive sound of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
for if they do not survive , the released forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not only have disa@@ strous consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post@@ modern 1930 , what it seems to me , it will be equally detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
by Roy Price most of them have never heard , although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very enjoyable minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is tender at Amazon Studios ,
the Amazon TV production company .
he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ fres@@ ur and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; Films , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fighting industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy can not pick any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are on the right side of this corner .
this curve is the evaluation distribution of over 2,500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows get this rating .
if your show is valued at nine and above , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; breaking bath , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ ting , where , after watching a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you already need special intelligence to enter@@ tain &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the mean yield , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t exc@@ ite .
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is there , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon is doing such a thing , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and introduces them online , where they can look at everyone for free .
and if Amazon comes out for nothing , one grab@@ s it right ?
millions of spectators are watching these episodes .
but they don &apos;t know they are being watched while watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you record when you start the show , when you pause , which parts one ski@@ ps or looks again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact they collect the data , process these and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House ends at 7.5 -- thus somewhat above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
instead of holding a competition , he and his team have watched the available data about the Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the reviews they give the shows their course , which shows they like , etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , what producers , what actors .
when they had all the parts together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; house of cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets an 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course the question is : what happened here ?
it has two very competitive , data @-@ sav@@ vy companies .
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is that ?
because logic somehow states that this should work with everything .
if you gather millions of data for a decision you meet , then you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics than Back @-@ Up .
you optimize it by very powerful computers .
the least you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work , then this is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time when we use more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the Multi @-@ Health Systems company here ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes into contact with this software in this room . come into contact with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in jail here in the US and asks for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge takes place or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be real bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . that &apos;s not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of experienced firms are sometimes wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it could predict out@@ breaks of flu , a bad way , through data analysis of Google searches .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ minated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked perfectly , year by year , until it suddenly stopped working ,
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the withdrawal of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data of experienced firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data flow increasingly in decisions of life -- at work , in the enforcement of law , in medicine .
so we should make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably use many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for cancer therapy
over the years I have recognized some samples of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dissemin@@ ated .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first , dis@@ assemble this problem into its individual parts , so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a branch you put the items together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to put the parts together again and then to come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it all : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , which they otherwise wouldn &apos;t have been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these pieces together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; wasn &apos;t in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they compete for TV ideas , then they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as the show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is telling us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget this , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a hunting or no @-@ question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- exactly here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will try out a technique demo later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have made some choices in my life so far , whereby I should have listened to the ball in hind@@ sight .
but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace it with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball will be smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right corner .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data , it still pays to make decisions , to be an expert in what you do and take risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
