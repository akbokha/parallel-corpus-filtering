<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA had illegally listened to telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, in which the CIA literally overturned Iran into a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter didn't like at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government has determined against Risen and asked him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn he became a symbol of the government's pattern to judge whistleblower and spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitution, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media does not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave ones they reveal.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to jail.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something exceptional happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they believed for years that it was essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, reporters and sources can hide more and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of splitting and risking assertions, this could also do its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, are secretly worried about his telephony,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, his credit, and even travel links with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistle-blot and crack.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblower. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result of a whistle-blowers went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional amendment because the government has more and more possibilities to spy out all." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology allows government to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "and indeed, they can do so from the moment in which they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software that didn't exist yet, when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is SecureDrop, an open source release system for whistleblower, originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, who has been developed and developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer procure information secret, and many of the information it would require would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureAnywhere, however, is only a small part of the whole in order to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new espionage technologies that jeopardise all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it is important to us to ensure that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to show misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers," ""</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to know about abnormalities in the supply of soldiers and wants to report from overcrowded hospitals. or the next environment worker who strikes alarm for contaminated water of Flint. or a Wall Insider that warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] This week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents from the resident law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca saying:" "" "okay, we need an anonymous enterprise. can you set up this?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of news, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has letterheads in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a $2 billion mark leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others who are nervous about the next release, and on the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agent or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems weep away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should that happen to us?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In the whole world, media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and obscure their wealth -- something we've been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem very confusing to this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matryoshka doll.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who lies behind these things.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what it is." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there were no prominent Americans so far who came to this scandal in these revelations.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "now it's not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle that these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some US states you need less information to provide less information to form a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">"" "" "" "this kind of intransparency in the USA allows employees of school districts to rip off schoolchildren." ""</seg>
<seg id="69">Scammers have allowed scammers to rip off especially vulnerable ears.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here with Global Witness, we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "it really shocked us that all of us up to a lawyer made suggestions on how he could transfer his money." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was given money. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">"" "" "" "it's not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our covert investigator." ""</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "it's not about a single top politician, involved in a scandal." ""</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to deal with this, we need to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very gloomy as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist I see quite a lot to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "over the past few years we have seen an increase in transparency, which concerns the owners of companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The issue attracted political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU registers in central registers at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind here.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties introduced a draft law in both parliament chambers, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"" "" "" "we need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy that get up and say," "" "Intransparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of intransparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together we can finally end the intransparency, which now enables this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I was abducted and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies I made a backyard sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda remained standing and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my artworks.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country. after that he would go to the Peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It got late. I became tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "and I thought," "" "Oh, man!" ""</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he said he would go to the Peace Corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to land abducted in the boot of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself saying," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "one voice in my head said:" "" "uh, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">"" "at night I lay in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," "" "Oh man! what did I get into it?" ""</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of bed, sneaking at toe tips to the door, and locked my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art that he had purchased from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my perspective.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To house people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let us make a time leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate draws and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could make something about it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including a mattress and breakfast each morning.</seg>
<seg id="128">"" "" "" "ha!" ""</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "we created a website and thus founded" "" "Airbed and Breakfast" "" "[Airbed and Breakfast = Airbnb]." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floors for 20 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure our cheese-ham-omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them throughout the city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stopped.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were at the same time finding new friends and paying our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into the roll.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if one could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented the investors: "we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, bathrooms, the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite strangers to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody who is still with comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you are contemplating the things that you can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie, we learned that design is much more than just look and feel - it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we strive for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked cell phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This soft touch of panic you can sense now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked cell phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most people feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So most of the guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just like that, who actually has Al Gores mobile phones now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is channeling for the president's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">They have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name; if he had told where he came from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 assessments that all say: "he can hold very well unlocked cell phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to release your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-thought-out feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for the people to leave negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had left their judgements before placing them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are in terms of age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly, we trust the people most that are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting if you add a person's call -- in our case through assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three evaluations, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stands out commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little, like" "" "Hi!" "", "you won't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "one tells too much, for example," "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is rather not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, such as "Great artwork in your apartment! I make vacation with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckon was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down those prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a requirement that had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is running very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who did not allow parties to celebrate parties or have devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests standing in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, over 123 million spent nights only had a fraction of a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people are trusting one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, wonderful things can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his judgement:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attack because of sedentary activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives even though they don't know them properly.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital if you die and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books past.</seg>
<seg id="220">They let you stay even longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not every stay works.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled over this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but now it's just" "" "rental industry" "" "to be called" "" "rental industry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People place a part of themselves openly, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, this is comparable to Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travel would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place you visit, a group there would have to wait to fill a thoroughly and show one at a tavern tour that has never been heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would create apartments from scratch?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would take the thought of a common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships, instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces owned by the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered to residents. students who were looking for a stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were taught to people whose children were moved out. incubator programs were launched,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 78,000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be so crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was a warm hospitality even before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it amazingly,</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda runs past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what design we can use in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the airport security check.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media are people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met Muslims, it is great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtegern-Fitness-Fanatikerin,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I wasn't born like that.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do that.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I made the decision to oute myself.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why do you suppress yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time it was a declaration of independence for me, in contrast to the pressure I felt as 17-year-old to adapt myself to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted passively the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought after, questioned, doubted and ultimately believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was confident and slow abandonment that deepened with every reading of the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes makes me cry.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone perceives you, you fully understand, and yet loves you somehow?</seg>
<seg id="287">That's how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began, like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">"" "later, after my marriage, I had a child and basically lived the" "" "Egyptian-American Dream" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"" "I was sitting in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word" "" "breaking News" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, planes flew into buildings, people jumped out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was it?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical fault?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="299">I changed the TV channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists..."... in the name of Islam... "...," Eastern origin... "..." Jihad... "... grindingly Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my country being attacked, but in the Nu the actions of others turned me into a suspect.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day, we had to drive through the Midwest of the USA to move into a new city and start the postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I behaved -- as we went silent -- as deep as it went into my seat, and I was the first time afraid to be recognized as Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then I heard and read and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said:" "" "be vigilant," "" "" Be careful, "" "" "Remember in well-lit areas," "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed inside the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday this week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "and again the warnings began:" "" "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I looked at the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people that were held for Muslims, free up and beating.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really burns hits on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something didn't feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">"" "" "" "I have put the anger of the people on the terrorists." ""</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are tough.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today, we can actually say people: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">The question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumour is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are futile because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims, like all other Americans, are not a tumour in the body of the United States, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America more secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">There might be a few parking spots free but not stopping the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque guides people to look more tolerant towards people of other faiths, and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And like me a head of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told, people are actually not radicalized in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">During the radicalization process, one has found that he begins online. first, the person is cut off from their church, even from their family, so that the extremist group can make a brainwashing, which causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behavior and their ideology is a traitor or by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we have to stop people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, like Ku-Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">"" "both groups claim their ideology on their" "" "holy book" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but when you look at them, they do not drive what they read in their" "" "Holy Scriptures" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality, which makes them read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. each minister, with whom she had spoken, brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her anger, she was a main target for instrumentalizing extremists who promised her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam re-established the connection with God and its community.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of blaming her for her anger, he showed her constructive ways of a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does ordinary Americans work?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show that if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We are more accepting an authoritarian government system, conformity, and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows that if test persons submit news in which negative about Muslims were reported, they rather agree military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood against Muslims pushed upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulating the public to undermine the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear hurts us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">When assigning collective guilt, it is not just about having to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, generous person she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when has my brother become such a savage young man?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Only a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan, who visited her in the afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot Deah eight times.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the start.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us by fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion freely.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat, we were silent, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took it out, drew my shoes, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw allowed me to stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, for half of them were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who had come not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had brought courage and compassion to panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think that we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say to those who might say that you are holding a TEDTalk, a thinker with draught, working in a classy think tank, so an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't be fooled. I am completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">"" "" "" "I am so ordinary as it is allowed." ""</seg>
<seg id="402">If you look at Muslims around the world, and I did this with the largest study of Muslims all over the world, people want ordinary things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people like an exception appear to rule, then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>

<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about becoming a billion dollar business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones.</seg>
<seg id="409">An autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRAC Centre in France has built a six-metre-high tower of 1 500 bricks in front of the public before the air-packing system in France. some years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting, airplanes reach high speed and acceleration in tightest spaces.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-winding structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to wear loads, deal with turbulence and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to cross the limits of possible in an autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to work autonomously, it must be collectively known where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands can be" "" "started" "" "and" "" "land" "" "at the highest level." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device trying to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starter pilots, it is efficient in the forward flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starter motors it can float, and therefore has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that the flight unit, no matter what position, achieves the optimum position and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often face fundamental abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be, for example, what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled aircraft that had only two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically simple remote control unit. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It only has a moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No valves, hinges and transverse rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, in the inner life a lot happens so that it can fly stable, and move in the room everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear starter. to get it to fly, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The odds of throwing it right if everyone is watching is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the monospinner is an exercise in contentment, this machine is here, the omnibus with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is very symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, he receives the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in space in all directions, no matter which direction it rotates or even rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some are imaginable in models, the rest is learned directly during flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at that.</seg>
<seg id="451">If flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two propellers.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise direction.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">If something goes wrong - a motor or propeller falls out, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further, even if limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">"" "" "" "we will demonstrate this by making half of the plane flightless." ""</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercially available micro-quadcopter -- each one weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly secure machine on the ground would like to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For guys like us, wages are in development and creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchantment our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="469">Three billion years ago, two black holes circled around each other in a very distant galaxy, so the mass of three suns transformed into pure energy in a tenth of a second.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they lit brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the whole known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not use their energy in the form of light.</seg>
<seg id="473">Finally we speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us first arrange the events temporally.</seg>
<seg id="476">More than 1.3 billion years ago, multi-cell life was created on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God stands for us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from the Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detectors to search for gravitational waves, which originate through colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most people thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognised her as crazy geniuses so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the Laser-Interferometer gravitational-waves-observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up period, the precision of Ligo could be significantly improved, which significantly improved recognition performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is now called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational waves rousing the two colliding black holes through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector too.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the parting of my father-to-death father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, that was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has studied gravitational waves from black holes for 23 years and their through observatories like ligo measurable signals. what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crushing in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">Instructional teachers in courses for relativity theory often perform a really silly dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"" "" "" "stretch and dust, stretch and dust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched and stretched by the waves. the elongation of an average person was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means 20 zeros after the comma followed by a 1. therefore, one explained the Ligo staff to be mad.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre-long laser detector, and that is already absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, the hunt for the waves as follows:" "" "the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will certainly be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite handy, because so you can create a picture or a map of things by taking the light around you from several points.</seg>
<seg id="509">With sounds, that is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually, impossible to produce a picture of things that are particularly significant to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">For example, your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume in order to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now just Alice" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo, the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can hear the universe literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">To listen to the gravity, about the collision of two black holes can tell us about the collision between two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, chirp: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">If the two bodies rotate very quickly, you can hear the same chirp with an additional key change. this sounds like the Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, embodied in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- hears Ligo the following: [Surrendes noise] somebody who knows what he needs to hear recognize this as a noise of -- SH:... two black holes with a 30-fold solar mass, that spin around as fast as the rods of your shaker.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve around one hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent importance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves an entirely new way to researching the universe as it was never possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the all and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in All we can - practically or basically -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in super-novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">However, the exciting physical processes occur at the core, which lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through because these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them since the Big Bang is obscured by his own light.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And most importantly, I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things right in the first casserole we had not expected.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this subject: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, as Ligo observes them, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak, the sauerknochen for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different view of the events in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately also how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and All.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than listening to the Big Bang itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of big dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">You dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for a year I would say to all" "" "Yes!" "" "that I was afraid of." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">"" "no matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say" "" "yes" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be on TV live?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what I was afraid of, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear to stop talking, my social fear -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes," "" "has changed my life." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes, which changed my life deeply, to an unexpectedly kind. it started with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three unbelievable daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. Emerson, the smallest one, calls all the" "" "kittens" "" "for inexplicable reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the South.</seg>

<seg id="572">"" "she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">From then on I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I'm doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very proud.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an astonishing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" sawing to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think things out, stir you up to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make TV, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are at the same time in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Every program offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">"" "" "" "the budget for an episode of a television channel can be between three and six million dollars." ""</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days with four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programs simultaneously: 24 episodes: grey's, 21 episodes: 1, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours Television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for one season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series run on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I created myself, and not just produced, so still overhead. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else does it?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you, that all of you who work so hard, whether you run a company, a country or a classrooms, take a business or a household, take me seriously when I speak of work so that you understand that I'm not just around the computer and imaginative, and it is true when I say: I understand that it doesn't dream of dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I deepen my work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I set up troops, as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As a bearer of a high sound, I run a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible. and the best part is the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is working well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy street, I could go on it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume that when I tell them the sums of money, I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't get me wrong, that's what she is doing.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the buzz -- when I began working with television production when I began working and working and working, creating, creating and working together, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The buzz is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a swamp, then you can't strive differently than on size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being able to do otherwise than to strive for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it's called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I'm not made for failure, and I only know that I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you that I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more overlapping boundaries, the more work there is, the more things at the same time, the more I write history, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the marathon, I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the swamp, the swamp, the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overloaded, exaggerated, burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mum is a single institute.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "kittens, I want to go to Shonda-Land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzz of the engine stamped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job any more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The buzz did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as usual: the same Titans work, 15 hours days, reworked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegating, a titanium does not sleep, does not give up, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no summons.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a showcase Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do when what you do, the work you love, suddenly faded?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think," "" "Today, stupid author Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you do, you do, you love what you are doing, being a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives you the buzz when you already knew the swamp when the buzz stopped, who is it then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern states waitress" "" "asks me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way outside, late and she says," "" "Mom, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she doesn't call anyone" "" "kittens" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I'm a Titan and mourn my swamp, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mom, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about this.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" "" "Everybody Poops" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding, because my pain and panic, in solitude and in the absence of summons, I can do nothing except to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, tender voices, wax crayons, and the song in which it is released, or whatever the girl in "Die Eiskönigin" release.</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something inside me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't immediately, but it happens, it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The swamp comes back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzz, but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The buzz, the working-sum, the titanium-humming, that's just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe myself with the aid of broadcasts and TV-hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The buzz is not a force and it is not working-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the current that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real buzz is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real buzz ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words to me, for what God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this to a fixed rule, so that I can free myself from any debt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the humming again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">"" "" "" "play is not as good as working." ""</seg>

<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at work than at home.</seg>

<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "honestly, I call myself" "" "Titan" "" "--" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>

<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst in soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I mostly feel stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always take my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is OK.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the buzz of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why did we stop playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you think me naïve, for a daydreaming.</seg>
<seg id="742">You are right, but you can do it too!</seg>

<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else.</seg>

<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have every day to do with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability for self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"" "they certainly have one of the best known ones, the" "" "deep brain stimulation" "". "in doing so, one implanted an electrode deep in the brain, in order to influence the circuits of the neurons in such a way that the neurological function is improved." ""</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease that suffered from severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story started 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was chief doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that the brain swells the brain and increases the cranial pressure in skull-brain traumas.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, you have to reduce the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find proper nutrition, temperature, humidity and the surroundings to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">That is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you know from biology classes that stem cells are immature cells that can transform into each cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the fetus stage, they are responsible for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they remain in us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to extract a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we re-planted them at the sampling table of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we re-implant these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we re-implant the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we re-planted the cells in a healthy brain and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared as if they were removed again, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury and re-planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew into mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were re-planted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells we dye in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets of one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable level of skill, we spent the motor-motor area in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could not move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Exactly as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralysed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, as well as with the ape.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached its level of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side, they see the monkey, who recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we re-planted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the plantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that we were also very exciting results.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">"" "Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" "" "I know someone who can do that." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, one has to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate and so on.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years will it take for someone to come to the hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority permit us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then it is necessary to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select patients to perform the treatments and assess whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you need to apply this to a multicentre study.</seg>
<seg id="897">First you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it's safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for your visit to TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">"" "" "" "we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society." ""</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchangeable.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved doubtful that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth, while policy remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy vanishes with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was misunderstood to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- should not affect the austerity programs that were realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rebellious friends who told me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you to an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Euro Group would be wrong, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and anti-democratic democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies are milked, our future bleak and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I would like to point to an interesting contradiction which is currently threatening our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin-peak paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain that casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the debt mountain,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which is one of the wealthy savers and corporations, who, however, are too anxious to invest there where it would be productive and bring income with which they would be able to wear the debt mountain and also produce all the things humanity needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion dollars were invested in the US, in England and in the eurozone, in all the prosperity producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, rails, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until we compare it with the 5.1trillion US dollars that were at the same time lying around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did nothing to inflate the stock markets and raise real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and unproductive capital are the twin-tops that are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand, which, as in an endless loop, supports the pessimism of investors, which could be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally brings about the circumstances leading to the fact that Oedipus kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hatred with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His very wasteful character. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents, and especially to finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the rescue of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue, what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the social form in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The athenic democracy, of course, included too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">But it would be a mistake to mitigate the significance of the athenic democracy due to these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive thing in the Athenian democracy was and is that it was deprived of the working arms, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but was more important and decisive that they gave them the right to political co-determination with equal votes in questions of state-of-the-state.</seg>
<seg id="935">"" "" "" "the Athenian democracy did not last long." ""</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, which lights very bright, it is burned out quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our present liberal democracies have not their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While Athenian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the toiling poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which in the end was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a more democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In today's democracies, there has been a relentless struggle between the two since the time when this separation of politics and economy has begun, and the economy gradually undermines politics and empowers it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because these days one can be in the government and still not in power, because the power has migrated from politics to the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hatred with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it's about like a herd of carnivores that have decimated so sustainably the animals from which it feeds itself, that they are starved at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy that has cannized politics so far that it is harming itself by the self-created economic crisis. the power of corporations is growing, political goods are devalued, inequality falls, the overall economic demand falls, and the managing directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their businesses.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism distributes the "demos" [the people] from democracy, the higher the twin-tops, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we need to bring together politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" retains control, just as in ancient Athens, except for the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the toiling poor only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new types of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, so long economy and politics are separate areas, automating the twin tops to become higher, wasting waste, and deeper social conflicts, like it -- very soon, as I believe -- will come in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we need to restructure the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we democratize the reunified sector, otherwise we end up in a pathological monitoring hyperautocracy, which makes the film "Matrix" appear like a documentation.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is not, therefore, whether capitalism will survive the technical gains that it has produced.</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is superseded by a dystopia, similar to that in "Matrix," or something similar to that of society in "Star Trek" in which machines are serving humans and humans spend their energy in exploring the universe, or indulge in a high-tech version of ancient Athenians "Agora," in long discussions the sense of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it do, how could it look like to have this "Star Trek" like utopia instead of the "matrix" similar Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of companies: please introduce a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital will follow you from one job to another, from one company to another, and the company -- no matter in which one is working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all revenues originate from capital and from revenues and the concept of wage labor is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction more between those who belong to the companies, but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, but who do not belong to them. no more exchange between capital and labour, no gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no uplifting twin-tops.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy: please introduce yourself in a nutshell that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the Cosmos," in units of "Cosmos" -- and every government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the surplus of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">"" "imagine that this fund is investing in" "" "green" "" "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare." ""</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time, not the technical means had to be implemented.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, especially against the background of a unified politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is at the same time liberating in which she prefers privileged individuals and Marxist, because it is buried by the separation of capital and labour in the trash bin of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else, it is a world in which we can imagine a true democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Fr. Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You write yourself in your biography as a libertarian Marxist.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything I have just said is relevant then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and the economy is... Do we not do this, technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers calls "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transfer of this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we are experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">As Hayek, that is why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am completely confused.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: indeed, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you aren't confused, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have very clearly stated what you think of the West's view of China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most plays away -- the area of the economy -- is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a sense, if I can say that provocative, China resembles the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that's a mistake historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical of the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What one can observe in China is similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now pretending to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smacks of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many people are curious about your experiences as the finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I sensed that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "to say goodbye to complacency, and the continued denial that a massive fault line has passed through the eurozone and continues to massively threaten the development of the whole European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which was, by the way, the first suggestion that revealed this denial.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Right to do. unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, have also voted for denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what's coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to get an economic system that is not viable to live through political will and authoritarianism, you might be able to delay it for a while, but when the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a minister of finance or any minister who is in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he claims he has made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the request for extending the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the donors' sides to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government down, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions that slept through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they had been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"" "it's worse than during the" "" "Great Depression." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "none of the" "" "Troika" "" "of the donor who imposed this policy:" "" "that was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive sound of talks, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they do not survive, the released forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">"" "" "" "this will not only have disastrous consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to take the path of a postmodern 1930, what it seems to me, it will be equally detrimental to the future of Europeans and non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for being with TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">By Roy Price most of them have never heard, although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very enjoyable minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is tender at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The Amazon TV production company.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelfresur and describes himself on Twitter as "Films, TV, Technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fighting industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can not pick any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are on the right side of this corner.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of over 2,500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows get this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and above, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "breaking bath," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addicting, where, after watching a season, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left side, here at this end, shows like" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "" "-- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve." ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you already need special intelligence to entertain "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the mean yield, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't excite.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is there, and of course it's the first time Amazon is doing such a thing, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and introduces them online, where they can look at everyone for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon comes out for nothing, one grabs it right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators are watching these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">But they don't know they are being watched while watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show, when you pause, which parts one skips or looks again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact they collect the data, process these and this results in the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom over four Republican US senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't so good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House ends at 7.5 -- thus somewhat above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a competition, he and his team have watched the available data about the Netflix viewers, so the reviews they give the shows their course, which shows they like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, what producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "house of cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"" "" "" "house of Cards" "" "gets an 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go." ""</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">It has two very competitive, data-savvy companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you gather millions of data for a decision you meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics than Back-Up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimize it by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least you can expect is good TV, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, then this is a bit scary because we live in a time when we use more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the Multi-Health Systems company here?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes into contact with this software in this room. come into contact with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail here in the US and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge takes place or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be real bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. that's not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of experienced firms are sometimes wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it could predict outbreaks of flu, a bad way, through data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked perfectly, year by year, until it suddenly stopped working,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the withdrawal of the publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of experienced firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data flow increasingly in decisions of life -- at work, in the enforcement of law, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people unimaginably use many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Over the years I have recognized some samples of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, disassemble this problem into its individual parts, so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a branch you put the items together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help disassemble a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to put the parts together again and then to come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, which they otherwise wouldn't have been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these pieces together and make a show like "House of Cards," wasn't in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first as they compete for TV ideas, then they chose "Alpha House" as the show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "this is telling us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I think things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget this, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it's also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it's amazing. for decisions using a hunting or no-question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "most likely" "" "-- exactly here at this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">"" "" "" "I will try out a technique demo later." ""</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have made some choices in my life so far, whereby I should have listened to the ball in hindsight.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace it with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball will be smarter and smarter. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data, it still pays to make decisions, to be an expert in what you do and take risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data, but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
