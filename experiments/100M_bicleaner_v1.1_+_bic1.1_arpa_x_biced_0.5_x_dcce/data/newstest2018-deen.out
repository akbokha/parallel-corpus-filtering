Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Irish institution , where young people today are to meet today .
a cryp@@ t chapel , where now for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel is dug .
farmers cultivate the former bottom of farmers .
Munich &apos;s oldest official map promotes exciting stories about days .
it anno@@ ys when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows it , which had to be exciting , because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i took a green meadow instead of a circum@@ navigation road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bayern of the State Government , are anything but current - but precisely because of this very revealing .
especially when comparing them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how towns and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich @-@ based Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a carpet of tiles , which you can &apos;t recognize as such .
more detailed maps were incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities , so @-@ called urine sheets .
these were based on Bay@@ er@@ isches Ver@@ mess@@ ungs@@ verwaltung from 18@@ 10 to 18@@ 64 , and from the first surv@@ eyed surv@@ eyed in Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops finally departed with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville of 9 February 18@@ 01 : it was the present neighbours who created the idea of a land @-@ covering Bavaria @-@ card .
Elec@@ tor Max IV Joseph further promoted the project , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian surv@@ eyed administration .
the judging sheet for Munich dates from the year 18@@ 56 and is to be found in the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek ( Bavarian State Library ) as any other .
the comparison morning / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has grown in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is send@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was conven@@ ed 21 years after the map was created , in 18@@ 77 , as a Munich part of Munich .
today the send@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ send@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 1878 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one can see nothing but fields - at first glance : in zo@@ oming a small @-@ cut map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand@@ written numbers numbered from the so @-@ called &quot; ur@@ anium &quot; from which the property tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots do not occupy more farmers there today - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sonne &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of send@@ ling .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the site of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of today &apos;s district of Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or from the hill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , people were once locked with del@@ u@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich district Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt was created &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
starting in 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden led the institution - the psychiat@@ rist , who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , ended the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Irish &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he forbi@@ ds the personnel to use violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients first place was first , and was expanded to 500 places later .
at some point this capacity wasn &apos;t sufficient anymore - the reason for the construction of the cir@@ si@@ r@@ ene facility in Haar 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ikum in Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psych@@ i@@ atri@@ sts since 2006 , has been located there since 2006 .
young people in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um are now meeting on the grounds of the former Augsburg prison .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with educational establishments .
West is the football pitch of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential houses from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was built - architec@@ turally reminiscent of the original construction of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during World War II in bomb attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the shopping cart called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich too .
the Al@@ lied bom@@ bers tore many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a great remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days were the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn track .
with the sli@@ ders , the old Munich @-@ map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
Om@@ bud@@ sman publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association to promote coloured people has issued a warning to coloured people who are travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discri@@ min@@ atory politics and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the Mis@@ sour@@ i state , which is to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i to take special attention while travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , race @-@ based incidents occur in recent times throughout the state and be noted here , &quot; stated in the group &apos;s opinion .
a recently approved Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which makes it difficult for people to win discrimination , as well as the state prosec@@ uting authorities who dispro@@ portion@@ ately aim at minorities , prompted the group to issue travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights , which happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during the trip and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without acc@@ using a crime .
the Council also points to a recently published report by the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i General Public Prosecutor , which is shown that black mot@@ ori@@ sts in the state will stop 75 percent more frequently than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be prepared to bring their deposit money or let their relatives know they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i reported 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s hate crime report program , which ranks the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it more difficult to su@@ e a company because of housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the States had adopted immigration laws that local law enforcement authorities commit to arrest people on account of immigration violations , which will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing .
travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but lately interest groups have deployed the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
the fence project is elementary
the Fischer@@ bacher Wei@@ de@@ j@@ n Project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the members of the CD@@ U and Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac provided a picture on the spot .
at the Court of Justice of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the CD@@ U @-@ village association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ uties .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first granted insight into his farm in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , supplies 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodated in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste only regional .
since he is also the BL@@ H@@ V chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he described the fence project as &quot; vital importance . &quot;
I cannot produce profit@@ ably on such steep surfaces .
the grass@@ land care for a lot of work , much needs to be processed with the br@@ ush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight with the conditions and top@@ ography here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ised Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the parent company and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer , even if he does not carry out bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognised the importance of the fence project and is happy with the support of leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are the farmers would have to be supported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that the re@@ for@@ estation of the land could be removed for quite a while . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they will continue their operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of funding , farmers often stand in criticism
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were f@@ enced in 2013 .
the area of disclosure is therefore 40 hectares , which cannot be for@@ ested up to at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total costs of EUR 71 500 , half of the leaders were promoted , one quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisch@@ bach .
thus the farmers kept 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of pasture fence .
&quot; the great advantage is the durability of the f@@ ences , &quot; Schwen@@ de@@ mann explained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and farmers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter Weiss : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here the best foods are produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Protection Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg is a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art promotion of expan@@ sions .
the aim is to maintain the Black Forest .
the prerequisite is the presence of a conveying setting drawn by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the f@@ enced area must not be slu@@ gg@@ ish ( inclin@@ ation over 35 per cent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation .
the request of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway for the Fis@@ her@@ bach &quot; Wei@@ depl@@ eting Project 2018 &quot; project .
the area of disclosure amounts to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin attacking the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as much as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ do Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tru@@ mp regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the President &apos;s proposals to dras@@ tically restrict legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ters would have told him if he had done it .
but it resor@@ ted to its importance , and in particular the importance that it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus was added to its base 17 years after the monument was completed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem that you refer to will be added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is fac@@ tu@@ ally correct , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Laz@@ arus , the only one in which a state does not only invite some old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , your oppressed masses , who y@@ earn to breathe freely , and the miserable garbage of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; miserable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our screens was better to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is in fact a conflict around the meaning of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who sat down to place their words after their death on the base - knew very well that they took a highly political action .
the sculpture was to show links between French and American re@@ public@@ anism , depicting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical portra@@ yal .
Laz@@ arus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ ants .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Laz@@ arus did change the importance of the statue , the people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the great scre@@ am R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty did not invite anybody , but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ ation@@ ist who brings the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here .
the importance of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative deed of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horrible journeys on the deck of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp would ever like to acknowledge .
their torch should not enligh@@ ten the way , but to ign@@ ite hatred that is their only source of power .
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ dges Scottish Members of the Great Britain Team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship header &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 , starting on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special develops &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the UK must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think there is something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ cher , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle is elected team captain by the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best overall number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir carries on this road and last year raised five British and two European records .
it will take part in 1500 m and 5,000 m races .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1500 m , is another Scot@@ sman who was supposed to watch the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
the team captain says they are &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also med@@ als and fin@@ als .
&quot; being so special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honor , but knowing that my team@@ mates voted for me and chose me , makes it something special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I &apos;m very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on platforms .
as for my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to sit on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will simply be a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; block &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critics of Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the inc@@ it@@ ement of voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers struck him for anything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he clas@@ ped with criticism , certainly .
but he has not sil@@ enced his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dum@@ b we are led as sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 persons who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and this is why the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him of this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na , and ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a Republi@@ can Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state that is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary hot @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to play his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , blocking of people who come to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum called officially and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokesperson A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the Gover@@ nor and argued that blocking the comments is nothing but a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not profound .
the priest cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the news show &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t like this idea even if a number of people take a position on the same issue , they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated Spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call another &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or being deleted a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in previous times when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles or to arrest and silence demonstr@@ ators .
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is su@@ ed by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue was in Virginia last week .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County passed the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable por@@ to had a similar effect as the internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter @-@ pens proposed his leadership .
and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions critici@@ zed his position on the agreement of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ m@@ ingly over@@ powered his ministry , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project .
but he has not put them into silence .
free speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are based on our nation .
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance club
the former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an organized the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year led to Arch@@ er@@ field Links to the final round before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved fame with this event , &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty said .
&quot; the players will see this course from his best side , he &apos;s in a great state .
Jer@@ ry made a great job when he saw this place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , even though he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not been able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I won them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to the promotion on home soil .
this event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a little bit more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the guy from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you feel this additional pressure too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing it again , and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad how it went so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer due to passive smoking
in the past two decades fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists from the University Medical Center Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer deaths per year can be attributed to passive smoking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said director Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on the subject of 1994 .
at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new study is published in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hous@@ ings prove to be very complex
the construction works in the v@@ ill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; reasonably in time , &quot; says the director of the building station Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house @-@ connections , the situation is more complicated than presum@@ ed , since in the underground much se@@ amounts , which is not noted in the plans .
traffic , which always hin@@ ders construction work , is a major problem for the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of mot@@ ori@@ sts in front of red lights and barriers is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are allowed to drive through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ dec@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p company have been working on the bridge for weeks .

poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , she does not use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her log house in En@@ arot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai province in the in@@ quiet Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the stolen Kn@@ ol@@ le is removed and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the lo@@ am floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. washing clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a dach@@ less room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were not assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course it can be dangerous to work late : most of the villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink difficulties , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 5@@ pm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occupying troops .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up the independence of the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the Jak@@ arta government , which maintains control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers from it .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided in Papua and West Papua where the independent part of Papua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island .
the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ u@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour car ride with the rented car .
there are no public transport links .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and made of corru@@ gated iron roofs , which were converted into different yellow @-@ brown tones by rust .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her vivid , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , dark shirt and bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold country .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high @-@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has mined gold and copper worth 3.1 billion US dollars .
in addition , Papua is worth $ 78 billion worth of wood resources .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for Papua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military preserves a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid almost $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars in one officer .
Pap@@ uan demands for greater autonomy threaten those golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal high@@ lands in the 1970 @-@ ies were committed to genocide in line with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3.@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we value everything &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report of the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as un@@ lawful exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electrical attacks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as every week incidents happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the screws have bol@@ stered since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development changes because Muslim economic migrants come from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung cant@@ ines sell roasted chicken and g@@ ado g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served .
local people are fighting to keep up with them .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native , who moved to the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; it has cost the native Papua , the mom@@ my mo@@ m &#91; the women &#93; of Papua , their market . &quot;
the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised during his campaign in 2014 to address ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Papua .
the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the Pres@@ idential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken , because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s initiation .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ am@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn off their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took offen@@ se in their tone and came back with four soldiers later , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , 16 years old , Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so severely beaten that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered at a football pitch in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting arches and performed the Wa@@ ita dance - in a circle constantly and a bird song im@@ itating - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago strain .
some demonstr@@ ators began throwing stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent by an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official TI@@ ME document that has not been released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ah , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto quarter of En@@ arot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was in the mood to listen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I suddenly got into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ah still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but he says that the ball came out of the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who just bears a name like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , the TI@@ ME in a glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot;
the Che@@ ap inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were being attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokesman of the Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the news about the kill@@ ings only arrived on the following day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filtered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Jak@@ arta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three weeks before Jok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , Jok@@ ow@@ i expressed a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical ab@@ norm@@ alities in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so that it won &apos;t happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he will set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism for sett@@ ling historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the injuries have occurred long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 @-@ s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tac@@ kling these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wir@@ anto had a retreat when he spoke with TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence vote of 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua were already included , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with bitter gul@@ li@@ bility .
&quot; I have been interviewed four times over the past three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ evic repeated the view that the people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police shot villa@@ gers in the neighborhood of Pan@@ i@@ ai neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to take a unconscious man into the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s sit@@ ing office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing up warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called upon the officers involved to hold an account and withdraw the police Brig@@ ade from the area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a source of trouble for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the &quot; Free Papua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of Papua by attacking spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM guides come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them Ta@@ di@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to this , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years and taken arbitr@@ arily in custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; securing national sovereignty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ am@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
the people here are building everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruits and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five fields of sweet potatoes each .
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown , which since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ u@@ ire airport have arrived in a larger number .
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and weal@@ thier migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we rarely have capital or the necessary skills to compete with their own companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai family council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
beyond that , restrictions of reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists , Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp , were deported from Papua with a lack of coordination with related institutions despite their rare permission to shoot .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ i &apos;s electoral campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ rest east@@ ern@@ most provinces of Papua and West Papua : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six p@@ acific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokesman of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there are free media , making it difficult to cover the evidence for human rights cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , locals broke their silence and urged him , &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the session but would remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua people probably won &apos;t vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sho@@ oting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Gob@@ i , the chairman of the tribal council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , except that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is located in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice to Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he must pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai shot down a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ pse of a victim was buried in a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know that they may never give justice to them , but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ evic with lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what else can we do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the world &apos;s highest towers in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to escape from the 3@@ 37 metre high , 79 @-@ story building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is accidentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the alarm and scre@@ aming people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; said a resident who called his name as George ang@@ ab , Reuters .
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said the fire fighting units against 4.@@ 00 a.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire and cooled down the building .
the government said she worked on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions on the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from facing , the exterior pan@@ eling for decoration or insulation .
in Britain , the police said that the system of plates for insulation and facing on the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : more best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has been pleased with its large Davis Cup @-@ Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the session in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup single was only supported on two odds , not spar@@ ingly supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
although they are often very long , but also very much cher@@ ished five @-@ set classics , the traditional rate remains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of member countries voted for the reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was only slightly missed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but we are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will continue to work on improving the application .
after many in@@ consisten@@ cies it was not until the vote that the proposal came to cast the final on a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only comparatively minor details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host right in the first round in the following year .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements for training places , etc . , will be facilit@@ ated and the players will have to complete fewer official media appointments before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 of 5 US travelers take forbidden objects into the aircraft , find a survey out
a survey among air passengers found that more than 20 percent intentionally or intentionally prohibited items were smu@@ g@@ gled by the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while they accidentally carried forbidden knives or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they were late discovered that they were mistakenly travelling with fire@@ arms , am@@ mun@@ ition or explo@@ sives .
the survey for more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules .
of the respon@@ dents who admitted that they have know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent m@@ illenni@@ als were compared with less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X .
the most common items that were deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent gave to know@@ ingly borne objects with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es also confirmed that they had deliberately brought illegal drugs to the aircraft .
the company said it had consul@@ ted travelers throughout the country to find out how many in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently taken smu@@ g@@ gled goods through airport security and how many could have done it intentionally .
it is no surprise that the people who are most likely to wear smu@@ g@@ gled goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - bear the certainty of those who fly the most frequently .
the company , however , points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing .
people are often uncertain what fluids they are allowed to take with them or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of items confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
for a while people thought that T@@ SA could look at books as smu@@ g@@ gled goods .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Elektro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to present with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far , he has so far under@@ lined that a part of the customers has already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la boss El@@ on Mus@@ k for the first time betra@@ yed another , less brilliant figure in the announcement of the latest quar@@ terly balance : the canc@@ ell@@ ations in the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k has often adver@@ tised more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery is just beginning .
now Mus@@ k ad@@ mits that the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 orders have already been withdrawn by 6@@ 3.000 .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is merely non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reservation payment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations are suggest@@ ing that Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to 12 per cent of all orders could become a problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
its argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2018 , all models will be combined - 500,000 , by 2020 one million . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are made per day .
who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new production lines without any major disrup@@ tions in practice without any major disrup@@ tions .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if it comes to larger delays , the non@@ com@@ mitt@@ ance of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because then the company cannot prevent unhappy customers from running in dro@@ ves .
EPA chief P@@ ru@@ itt reti@@ res due to dela@@ ying the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to cut emissions
one day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce the emissions of Smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change as his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of the state &apos;s environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint , which was raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about a period running on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for O@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance for one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a before his appointment , was a reliable opponent of tough@@ er environmental regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly failed to block or delay regulations that resist the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ sion regulatory rolling back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington has decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , which obliged oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement released on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that its turn @-@ around in o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for carrying out and then waited to set the deadline for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings and we take delivery deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority that gives us , seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; yet the opinion of the EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available full @-@ powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on solid policies and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive reform of the o@@ zone rules .
the draft law approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set to vote in the Senate .
the New York Public Prosecutor , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of States that had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the group wanted to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York included in this case California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ian , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil O@@ zone arises when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and every year contributing to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of the public health sector and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered on P@@ ru@@ sion &apos;s surprising change of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the tru@@ mp government to tackle environmental pollution and its special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ our celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church will be invited to the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.@@ 30@@ pm to a seren@@ ade .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village , the historical St. Hil@@ arius complex is a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z seren@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ bl@@ ure their concern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique village jewel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in a documentary book in the Wu@@ ert@@ tem@@ berg pri@@ mor@@ dial : &quot; Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the &quot; Vog@@ t@@ ei &quot; at the Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the wor@@ ding of the document , on the Hill of Tum@@ linger , besides the former parish church , there was also a beautiful courtyard , to which the church or the pat@@ ron@@ age belonged and not the other way round .
there were also people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ amt Freuden@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the village image of Tum@@ our , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the community centre of the village .
ancient maps dating from the period around the year 1600 reinforce these historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval church law .
a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied with a priest still remained the owner of this church and was able to inher@@ it this church .
associated with this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two dig@@ its at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942 .
during the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were cut and the bells were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 , French troops were en@@ camp@@ ed near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and the church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remnants of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the church was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower was left .
in the New Year &apos;s Eve in 18@@ 34 a storm split up the church tower and half collap@@ sed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished .
only the present tower @-@ tower today was preserved as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today , Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em take care of the &quot; Schaff@@ haus@@ er Rent@@ als &quot; as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius installation .
the organisers invite the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ bl@@ gens on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth seren@@ ade on the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
it is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler High School Freuden@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the final word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3 : 30 pm .
at the end of the seren@@ ade , a trunk is taking place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organisers set out fantastic views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the seren@@ ade only takes place in dry weather .
the organisers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius complex , which is of importance to tum@@ ors and hearing @-@ dig@@ gers .
friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ bl@@ gens are particularly committed to the care of home care , such as the Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini .
association wants to permit approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see any legal requirements for the construction and has therefore turned to the coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim refuses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has asked Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw his authorisation for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen , only at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal there was a wind force concentration zone .
in this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
such zones are intended to prevent &quot; con@@ val@@ escence &quot; of the landscape .
while the city of Vier@@ sen had already decided to change the land use plan a second wind power zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette had been decided by a change in the land use plan - but it did not appro@@ ve the Düsseldorf district government because of a mold failure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning law , the granted approval decision is still un@@ lawful and therefore to be taken back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break the City Council again decided the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the place where the issu@@ ance of authorisation for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letters have entered the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes her to the occasion of re@@ viewing the matter again .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday refused to express itself in terms of the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a NEW subsidiary , plans to build four @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , has concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hect@@ are site .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be met - this equ@@ ates to roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ member households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s city council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch Wind@@ park near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind power plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was wounded fat@@ ally .
two more persons were injured slightly .
the road stopped for hours .
according to police data , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch drove the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 year old mother as a companion .
city and traders plan &quot; home shopping &quot; -@@ weekend
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the commercial association and the city council want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to l@@ ure the inhabitants to the shopping spre@@ e in the city centre .
as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to what offers their own city does away from the usual supermarket commodity .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
in addition , local firms are to present themselves with their training places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the region .
in preparation for commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags pointing to the action @-@ weekend , Christian König .
the Municip@@ ality and Trade Association co @-@ operate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the trade association and the city go into a further stage of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive city centre &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes new promotions , such as the first &quot; active day &quot; to the well @-@ known Sunday , conversations with all business travelers and hosts in order to move them to active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential is to be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened again .
this includes passengers and tourists .
but many locals also lost sight of the inner city when shopping .
in the end everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the city center - up to land@@ lords , the businesses of the whole city and clubs .
it was necessary to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network which had partly spread , King said earlier in the spring .
Birgit St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Mühl@@ hausen , announced that Germany &apos;s third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day , for the first time , will take part in five Thurin@@ gian cities for the first time .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , these are Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ er@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote appreciation of local commerce and emphasize its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action led by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Industry and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct environment with his purchase behavior .
two deaths and several injured after an explosion at U.S. school

a first mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ement later was also found dead .
the dead were employees of the school .
as an accident , the authorities suspected of working on a gas pipeline .
at the holiday season only a few people stayed in the building of the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy .
Tru@@ mp res@@ igned after full tran@@ scription of phone call Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription of phone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leader of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tru@@ mp called for a phone call with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned boundary wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president accused him of publicly den@@ oun@@ cing the Wall . report@@ edly , he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States , and s@@ wore to pay Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull was also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull said that a trade for the USA refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia would be &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade which was given by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the US .
Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most unpleasant phone call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford massacre : activists perform rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ching as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ old Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white rider to reach the bridge , a group of white men stepped out with rif@@ les to block their way .
the captain of mo@@ bs - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous stre@@ ak - took a long train at his cig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
inside the passengers flo@@ ated in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams torn the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged by the passenger seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is just a reproduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neck , almost everyone in the audience met very real si@@ ghs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , civil rights activists have come back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were re@@ yn@@ ched by K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one has ever been accused of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organising the post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of the state Georgia and a lifetime civil rights lawyer .
it serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must get justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a bai@@ li@@ ff takes a towel over the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI files received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ching process .
but no one was ever accused .
although the susp@@ ects remain free on foot for decades , citizens &quot; rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice enabled the black people in Georgia to vote for their vote in the summer in the summer .
about at the same time as the election , according to the FBI the black farmers Roger Mal@@ com a white landlord , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight down - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s &apos;s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she bore was not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
but when they were then removed from the prison and approaching the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison has prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FBI &apos;s report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and supp@@ ressing the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you let yourself register and if you vote , then this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual delivery of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de .
their representation is vivid , po@@ ign@@ ant and founded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and even harder to see , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about Lyn@@ ching because we are confronted with the ug@@ liness of all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I &apos;ve done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest of the Black - pushed into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ coordinated overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the chef @-@ clan member for many years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to those times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester scre@@ ams and push@@ es him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , wa@@ ving away from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona said the fire .
there is a pause .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; Ras@@ cona asked .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think that white people were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n --- he &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the other black actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you only have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and precisely there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins again .
this time when Ras@@ cona said the N @-@ Word , he says it sharply and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition will end violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman clothed with a mour@@ ning dress is over the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays be@@ aming praise to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred yards behind it a group of about four dozen people caught silence and tears from their eyes .
the audience is divided almost equally between black and white .
a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the street .
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive humidity for almost eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de took place , the air feels gh@@ ost@@ ly .
when the last notes of the songs sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the body &apos;s name .
children sit on their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mut@@ tered a little boy as if he wanted to remember it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the ch@@ ord and wipe off their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit that the clan member has played .
Nick Ras@@ cona hu@@ gs two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that it is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you did this for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience sat together with the actors for dinner .
at a table a white pair of Atlanta talks about the night@@ mare with a black couple that they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky fought to find words , which feeling left the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ x is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today this is called only police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone adm@@ ires Broo@@ ks court at his table , he eats and recalls the civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reproduction is inspiring in a certain way , as it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so , if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ conc@@ iled the Wagner @-@ ians in Bayreuth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf relies on a colorful fri@@ vol@@ ous staging in front of a gigantic six @-@ story setting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows a bul@@ ky street corner , including the Berlin Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before that , an open Mercedes @-@ Benz car , in which the Rhein@@ go@@ chter pos@@ ing as a rock beer , or alternatively an Is@@ etta .
st@@ acked oil barrels reminiscent of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - which moves through his &quot; Ring &quot; production .
the three Rhein@@ gold daughters - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful .
ess seduc@@ es Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , conf@@ ers a body into the trunk in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier and enter the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderfully fi@@ ery Hagen , which en@@ circles the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when he sm@@ iles Siegfried .
later also Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) has to believe in it .
the audience thanks the ensemble with powerful applause .
Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ce and Con@@ duc@@ tor Jan@@ owski are celebrated stor@@ my , who hum@@ bly bow down and de@@ fle@@ ct the hands of the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows for the first time on stage - in light of the great heat .
the performance was eag@@ erly awaited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team .
in 2013 , he had to leave a g@@ own of the Pfei@@ f@@ konzert above him , there were five years later great jubil@@ ation , in which the scattered &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls went underground .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner should have been pleased about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one real@@ ises that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the dpa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf but it has also grown to an understanding of its point of view .
I draw a positive summary .
max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : normally in st@@ einf@@ urt at the furniture market , once a week I will be helping here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked at school in an open day .
what are your experiences with it ?
crowd : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ time volunteer .
how does it come from ?
quantity : I made Ab@@ itur .
and then a civil engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully cancelled .
I realized for myself that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else , work with people .
and then I asked what you do .
do a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , at the focal point maybe , really is .
and was it like that ?
crowd : I collected great impressions .
in the winter semester I will start my studies in the social system .
I will study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker training and studying in Ham@@ m at the university of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you are doing his FS@@ J .
one can make it from the old people &apos;s home to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .
unlike in civil engineering studies ?
crowd : well , here &apos;s not about calculating st@@ atics .
you always have other people in front of you , each having a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager who has been taken out of the family , must always be dealt with individually .
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have any reservations ?
crowd : I &apos;m not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
a lot of love , much kindness .
there are also some negative moments , but life is that way .
Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that they will cut further 3,000 jobs and cut their intermediate dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces .
the job breakdown , which General Director John Fall@@ on announced mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , is in addition to his previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs have already been lost .
in May , Pear@@ son announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in May in order to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning .
the company , which last month sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year remained unchanged after an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kon@@ vo@@ i Attack of Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul Afghan capital , killed a soldier of NATO and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , a declaration made by NATO .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died during the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in a NATO statement , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had occurred when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated at Bag@@ ram in the US military hospital .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , of which 20 % were in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bom@@ ber killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
on 31 May , a huge bombar@@ d@@ ment killed in the centre of the city more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack of the country since the US @-@ led troops forced the Taliban out of power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp considers increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul also have caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policies and in particular in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA Ref@@ ill Dec@@ ision to Del@@ ay the Smo@@ g Ru@@ le after Pla@@ gues
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama administration , after which the states are obliged to cur@@ b the Smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place a day after 15 countries su@@ ed the agency because of the step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone regulations 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said that it will show the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and from responding to our state partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June the intention of EPA to define the O@@ zone Regulation - in which in a part of the country emissions should be measured in order to define where inc@@ isions need to be made to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - in order to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 largely democratic states , together with Colombia &apos;s district , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp attempted to return a wide range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda to boost economic growth according to Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have spark@@ ed the demo@@ crats and nature reserves who are worried about the effects of major emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ing air that contains o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reducing lung function and increasing respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
community wants common space
in the end , the decision was clear : at two votes the Municipal Council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ tz@@ els decides to set up a community space in the future retirement residence .
before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing part of the land is signed , says mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it will still take a while until the area belonging to the church community has so far been in the community , there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be stem@@ med from a private investor .
there is a discussion about a community space .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council ho@@ ver before seeing such a common room not as a meeting place for the inhabitants of the people &apos;s just living , but openly entering the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision taken by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided last autumn by funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the construction is in the rehabilitation area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the establishment of a community space would be , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports T@@ j@@ aden , capable of promoting 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proposed resolutions are to signal the investor that in this respect he does not want to throw a cub@@ it between his legs , the statement that both saddle - what is le@@ aning against the surrounding environment - as well as the pitch roof - which reduces the lifting height and makes building more economical - would be possible .
need@@ less to say , Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mann means this addition .
when it helps : unanim@@ ously he passes the body .
it is not that easy in the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many own buildings with which one does not really move forward so that one now rest in the common room from the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is absolutely referring to the common room - but absolutely against a communal participation .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface there is no surplus , but a real counter@@ value in the case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers &apos;s request to appro@@ ve the proposed resolutions may be found in three advoc@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two votes in the original program that summ@@ arises Stefan H@@ aller : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we summ@@ ari@@ ze the decision , we make a huge step in closing a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with Auto : Rad@@ ler is thrown on the road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car in Gar@@ ath on Wednesday and severely injured .
as the police ha@@ sten@@ ed , the 82 @-@ year old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road from the road Schwar@@ zer Weg to Hil@@ den on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg .
the Senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger in the same direction granted him priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder went to the street , he apparently did not heed the traffic .
he joined a car with a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ gn@@ ant .
FC Bayern Munich must give up at the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must leave the game against Dortmund .
with human resources the FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season .
seven professionals lack the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
the personnel take care of the German Football Champions of Bavaria Munich before the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must also ren@@ ounce the B@@ V@@ B on David Al@@ aba . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was confirmed by the Itali@@ ans on Friday .
in addition , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats over the past six years , An@@ cel@@ otti had the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official game of the season .
&quot; football is also a tactic , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans .
the game was sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 viewers , divided the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
in the resin of star mig@@ rate to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the resin , the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shall arise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the plan for the Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg ( Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg ) .
a Plan@@ etary Trail exists in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star@@ path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes against the need for information of many hard @-@ go@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ at@@ tain@@ able installations in five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in@@ quired St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber .
the information on the boards should be complemented by internet .
for this reason , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later the star@@ path train is to be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star@@ path , the viewer experiences a lot of interesting facts , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star was shining stronger than another , even though it was far more distant .
it is also possible to see in which con@@ stellation a selected star can be found and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating the highest observ@@ atory in Northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
frequently , from there , the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y with the naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 , in the Uni @-@ Stadt , there is something similar to the planned star wer@@ g - the Plan@@ etary Trail - at the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen .
starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary Trail leads up to H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ es with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to @-@ degra@@ ded Plu@@ to at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun &apos;s exactly 75 metres away measures 70 centimet@@ ers away .
the total distance of the planetary path is about four kilometres .
while the light from the sun to the Plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fixed star would last half a year .
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who were to be on a collision course in order to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion , went down the hall to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing organization super @-@ spring weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through a unanim@@ ous vote on the former four @-@ division World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia put out the right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
when the pair posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko &apos;s manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I rose up for bronze &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to come down on lightweight .
and he must move on lightweight trucks &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that is what the fans demand .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxes need this battle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
climate asked whether it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound debut this year to arrange a date with Gar@@ cia next summer ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also took interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell following their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode because all fans have asked for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said , and later expressed himself openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he guess Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he might take part in his Saturday fight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks that the three combat champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slowly , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted the Ko @-@ Off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact , then boxing .
both said they could feel the momentum that was built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the fight which must be done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been waiting for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mik@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four injured after a tire burst
in the event of an accident at the A@@ 7 , four persons were seriously injured in the afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost control of his vehicle at 4.@@ 30 a.m. shortly before the outlet of the market .
the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where it over@@ turned and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was locked north@@ wards for about an hour , then traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three @-@ monkey works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping for the 2 : 2 to the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that optim@@ ising the defense formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first round of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result also that there were not the two opponents at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to look better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the triple @-@ chain should also be further optimized .
and the For@@ tun@@ en doesn &apos;t want to catch a gate after a collision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , there will be no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is able to cope better even after the experience in preparation with the three @-@ leg@@ ged chain than with the four @-@ leg@@ ged chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is confident of his cause , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prerequisite is , but that we harmon@@ ise even better and we don &apos;t have so many play@@ mistakes in construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can talk about a mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we stand with four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly be able to speak of a good season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only judged the start of the season after six to eight days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to a storm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ y and Hoffmann believes that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her , as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an ascen@@ sion favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know so 100 % where they are at present , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defender of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
admitt@@ edly , the guests from the Rhin@@ eland make their way to the meeting in the finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we sweep them away , just because we have the claim to come under the first six , is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the second Bundes@@ liga , which you have to beat in advance , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as boss coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; making such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results published by Swedish asylum seekers
recent results of testing for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authorities for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ inal@@ stra@@ et ) have started conducting tests last year .
they should examine the assessment of the age in the case of the asylum procedure , after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for mistakes in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees that were minor .
until today , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6.@@ 8@@ 80 cases to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; probably 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years of age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er lied about his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there were 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det investigated the 5@@ 81 results , she found out that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , when X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the En@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus from the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves the evaluation of the biological ri@@ pen@@ ess of people to see whether they went through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot say , we should not pret@@ end if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of assessing a child as an adult is low . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is that if the person is under 18 , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a seven tons of heavy concrete was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , construction manager at the Department of Road and Transport at the Freiburg Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April the work began at the same time on all three refurb@@ ishment @-@ needy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the construction end is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be respected .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is an arch bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red sandstone and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges are leading across the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge can@@ opy .
this is a marginal fix@@ ture , which is also used as an operating route .
on the southern part of the bridge , a bridge can@@ opy should be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is supposed to be gone .
the special thing is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridges .
a special finger tip feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable , connected to which many companies are connected .
the local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
fish and cra@@ y@@ fish first had to be f@@ ished .
for bridges between the building yard and the round@@ about towards Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach entrance , the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is completely closed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the three brid@@ ging measures amount to 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : ban on German potato salad
it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , which is otherwise difficult to reconci@@ le .
the parties represented in the circle of volcanic Eifel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag this day , because the Af@@ D invites in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer hall in R@@ ond@@ ell , according to the poster &quot; great election campaign . &quot;
and well @-@ known names start at the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top @-@ winning duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the Vice @-@ President Be@@ atri@@ x von Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on the spot already hours before the start of the event don &apos;t want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ eag@@ les , but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; originally , the city @-@ picnic was planned under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All at a table &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now takes place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a colorful picture that is present .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chairman of the forum A world and one of the decisive organizers , is really happy : &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which also the Af@@ D could eat without problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police has ordered many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing their presence , especially at the station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D vul@@ can@@ ic Eifel reported that he tried to make such an event and got the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes there are not enough parking spaces available .
so the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pe is happy that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
he says : &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
this also does it : at about 8@@ pm there is a band for entertainment at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , in the Stadthalle various speakers , including the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Junge .
in the hall there are about 200 listeners who are waiting for the top candidates for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Vice @-@ Chair@@ woman Be@@ atri@@ x von Stor@@ ch to hold her speeches .
the police presence remains unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour the Af@@ D @-@ event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can move - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one strikes trump@@ ets
&quot; &quot; &quot; a re@@ union with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wolf@@ enb@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is available in the series of Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ konz@@ erte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 p.m. in the monastery church . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and lau@@ re@@ ates of numerous international competitions and held solo positions in Europe &apos;s top @-@ class orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both combines the desire to not only transc@@ end the boundaries of their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of different genres .
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new ro@@ be , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music , &quot; together with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz@@ ech@@ op@@ ener N@@ ils W@@ ogram , mixes classical jazz , jazz and free playing to a fascinating piece of art .
this core of the program was premi@@ ered in Freiburg only this spring .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously integrated into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheeses and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart spoke openly about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was the one of her &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately went out bit@@ terly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in spite of all this , the brun@@ ette portra@@ ys the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was in love with everyone I have been working with . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I &apos;d have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived and believed in du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it has never pu@@ zz@@ led me or hin@@ dered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I never liked it to be taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she especially suffered from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but at school time when she liked dressed like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girls , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public doesn &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to relate to a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself in front of the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tru@@ mp that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the demo@@ crats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thought ... Today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a coach , I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp announced a big announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , according to For@@ bes , is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes finds out that he has coal mines in five states and inherited a coal store by his father .
it is worth approximately 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation on Thursday evening in which it said : &quot; the change of the party of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic party that would rather hin@@ der us from making our country great again . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 govern@@ ements and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party , which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive one , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the R@@ NC chair@@ person Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing scandal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e praised on Thursday what he described as a clear ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing scandal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be included in the sport again .
Russia &apos;s Ath@@ le@@ tics Director , D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin , said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who have been grab@@ bed gold and silver med@@ als at competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) on state @-@ supported dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire congress have been pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized by itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been achieved , but Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the spoiled system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still inadequate and banned trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in London after a speech at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
funeral P@@ act for Mali St@@ ressed Sol@@ di@@ ers
during a funeral service in the North H@@ essi@@ an Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1,000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city with high security precau@@ tions .
for an un@@ explained crash , Secretary of Defense Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she described the two other pilots as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pros of their trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice , which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter .
at noon , only the members of the church took their leave .
after that , the funeral service started in the circle of the family , closest friends , from representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the German Armed Forces Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
roses down , the relatives were standing arm in arm at the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers pursued the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Minister of Defense of the Le@@ yen described the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sh@@ attered &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ mann set up the flight operation of the military helicopter Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six qualified tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment , to whom the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the crew couldn &apos;t turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show the Le@@ yen Council : the use is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral ceremony , the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
when and where to be buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
that divided the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de cathedral church .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , he said further in the announcement .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired and also puts the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prinz@@ reg@@ enten@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik has not received the title and the function he wanted , he does not see himself as equal to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the leader of the Danish royal house .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ bility , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in London in 1965 .
at the Th@@ ames he worked in the French embassy .
while his later wife always had the sympath@@ ies of the people , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his nearly fifty @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik said about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was swa@@ ying , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ l@@ ises I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation in this country to be the brand of socio @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
according to Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , after the loss of red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , he does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday the parliament voted for the dissolution of the parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising resignation of a Green MP from their parliament in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Sunday elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ westen substanti@@ ated her move with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for election 2018 in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD@@ U leader Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to encourage his Group to record it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this meant that CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
to date , the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag is scheduled to be scheduled for January 14th .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority .
however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it indispensable that the parliament resol@@ ves its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Constitution also envis@@ ages the possibility that the Minister @-@ President with@@ draws trust and el@@ ects a successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these options must be checked legally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will calm@@ ly discuss all questions if they are legally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; but something kur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she described herself as a follow@@ er of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arians to return their land of land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it goes without saying that she returns her country of land , which she has received over the green state list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Anja P@@ iel said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We depl@@ ore the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I decided to have no pron@@ unciation in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the violation of the Anglo @-@ Saxon Gre@@ ens , El@@ ke T@@ westen , to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the head of the S &amp; D Group on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly choose the Land@@ tag .
the exit of T@@ west@@ ens costs the majority of red @-@ green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her pen@@ ultimate vanity and fru@@ stration her personal interests for the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critici@@ zed SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a scandal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony is doing this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to make political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nieder@@ sach@@ sens CD@@ U leader Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his dep@@ uties to include El@@ ke T@@ westen into the CD@@ U .
the group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused T@@ ests of distor@@ ting the results of the 2013 country elections with a personal career .
the CD@@ U was the strongest force in front of the SPD , but SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one vote in Land@@ tag .
Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from fo@@ stering , Herr Schmidt ?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .
how could the scandal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is in the interview with the editorial office of Germany ( R@@ ND ) and answers .
Mr Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from contaminated eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal States provide the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ Char@@ gen on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , according to everything we currently know , a health hazard is practically impossible .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has turned off immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany &apos;s concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade has the same responsibility as manufacturers to ensure that the products sold are safe and safe for health .
if the return level of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not able to transport .
un@@ loaded eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time not the farms are to blame .
are production plants and consumers in the same boat ?
according to the state of knowledge , the production companies do not have immediate debt .
rather , they must expect economic damages due to the alleged illegal practices of service companies .
as always , there are too little controllers in the case of a serious incident .
is there only a lack of personal or conclu@@ sive competence ?
it was precisely the official controls that have uncovered the process .
however , the truth is also that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded from 100 percent .
precisely because of this , a consistent clari@@ fication of such events and the transfer to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s parties in cases where criminal off@@ ences may be available are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear several times that I am expecting a complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular al@@ er@@ ism really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the consumers have the right to only get safe and traffic @-@ capable food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an insec@@ ti@@ cide not approved in the food industry is used , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pan@@ ac@@ kl@@ ist means manufacturers , retailers and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ borne animals is not acceptable and must be terminated without delay .
at all levels it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure .
I expect all relevant authorities to solve the problem quickly and without gaps .
how the financial rules of football on Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded issues of European football clubs will not distur@@ b Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spain to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the executive organisation that over@@ sees the European game has the power to for@@ bid teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules launched by the UEF@@ A in 2011 mean that PS@@ G has to prove that the transfer from Ne@@ ym@@ ar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to extract the Brazilian from its contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make the money loose for Ne@@ ym@@ ar to sign it and bring it into a galax@@ y of other stars , given the funding of the team by the power rich family of Qatar .
clubs may spend a lot of money on the purchase of players , but must counter@@ act legitimate income sources that allow them to break the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini following his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that associations that had taken enormous debts in their quest for success effectively dec@@ eive and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration on the debt of clubs to monitoring their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Abr@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - a tough@@ er issue .
during the current three years of the FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the presi@@ dency in 2015 , his UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to deter from excessive spending .
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly increase the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount of invoice for the duration of its contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the sum of redemption for the next five years amounted to EUR 4@@ 4.4 million in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs who could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company would sponsor the PS@@ G , if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered to be a legitimate income .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the P@@ SA sponsored by Qatar Tourism Authority was infl@@ ated .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar could come about payments by the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have cont@@ ested that Ne@@ ym@@ ar World Cup ambass@@ adors will become and such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easy to figure out .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive to any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G via Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Transfer , announced on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .
they talked about the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than € 10 million with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last financial year have to be published .
PS@@ G expects Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s arrival a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and jer@@ sey sales .
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
the Spanish league was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s departure by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kat@@ ar &apos;s last owner to PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga vis @-@ à @-@ vis a state that finances an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consistency of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play , because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new provider of chocolate chips
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Board Cho@@ colate has made board chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet co @-@ operation is in front of a possible end : the airline writes the order anew .
Swiss spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on request from the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; of Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some 17 million small , red @-@ and @-@ white chocolate bars distribute 14 grams per year prior to landing to passengers .
the Swiss didn &apos;t want to provide any information about the costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of about 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but even more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious job for a producer of chocolate producers .
as many applicants do in the new tender , Swiss will not want to reveal .
but only Swiss manufacturers are in question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to renew the contract over the spring of 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a statement .
the Swiss have been distributing chocolate bars on board their flights since 2006 .
before the Swiss signed a contract with Mig@@ ros &apos;s daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has built the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
the opportunity to place the logo was introduced Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of co @-@ operation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline co@@ operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights , the customers of the First Class are spo@@ ilt with goo@@ dies from the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in the business class nas@@ chen passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi of Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y is also spread on the short circuit , both in business and in Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the eigh@@ ties , for the 90 @-@ years @-@ Gr@@ unge era ( when the pioneers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch @-@ comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook capable era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd humour ( it contained an original story for a promising vegetable that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by raising themselves to the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play hor@@ ny kids who will grow - they nevertheless managed to win the last part of the squ@@ ad .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the watering can principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ he years like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The Hand that cra@@ ck@@ les the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point , a character sticks through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gra@@ cious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now a novel@@ ist , has not yet forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) has not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy @-@ vi@@ cious plot involved in the Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s sub@@ li@@ pp@@ ies of &quot; singles &quot; whose former big @-@ man @-@ on @-@ camp Andy feels like an old boy .
it &apos;s the moments of random ma@@ dness that could inc@@ ite this fran@@ chise as a sort of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches what I call his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater &quot; whose final scene will show the band how to visit the movie premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Amazon now reminds of another kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his east @-@ to @-@ west ring @-@ war icon@@ ography . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comedy created by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka is to be a found television series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est fighting for truth , athei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregory and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues are dub@@ bed by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice ags for viewing ( the police spends the time watching chess on TV as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Find out the voice &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is so committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ agan &apos;s mask - that it often plays like one . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which was reduced to a lower length could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ sati@@ re , because Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef are constantly visiting the American embassy , whose Lobby is always occupied by two big men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can all make all food for a v@@ ow .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian creators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
strike against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police is a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ Kreis district , Rot@@ t@@ weil , Constance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office shared Constance on Friday .
fifteen accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years , and arrest warran@@ ts were already issued against them .
in addition , officials made large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros .
two people were arrested during the same ra@@ ids in Italy .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two will probably be extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
the action was attended by Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators .
over 300 polic@@ emen were deployed .
the Maf@@ ia &apos;s members are accused of organised crime , violent acts of violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ bery and black@@ mail .
since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the fight against organised drug trafficking in southern Germany .
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the major deployment was accompanied by four civil servants from Palermo .
the studies focused primarily on Italian nationals with regard to the Italian Maf@@ ia .
also an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account .
Weise lam@@ bs large gaps in the for@@ eigner &apos;s register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the alien register in Germany shows substantial short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ management decisions in the case of asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Affairs of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the foreign country register .
defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to some serious mis@@ decisions in the case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; warned the newspaper &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
according to the Register , ten million people are registered with foreign citizenship , including about 5.@@ 7 million out of non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore administered by approximately 600 foreign country authorities in Germany .
because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , the quality of the data has not been good in parts so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases data had been found by 1921 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data entries can slow down revers@@ al processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
meanwhile , the German government has apparently begun sending refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they are entered from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , in the paper it is said that BA@@ MF will carry out such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - after Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 this was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , refugees from the EU state are responsible for reaching them first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant is travelling to another EU country , this state can send it back to the entry country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ministry now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile the reception capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has increased significantly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy gave guarantees for the inclusion and accommodation of family guarantees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments sufficiently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other EU states would also send refugees back there as part of the Dublin Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the domestic political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing fraction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children threaten un@@ lawful reception conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the lack in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach had already provided blood don@@ or service for other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
Jürgen Gre@@ ene , who , with his 100 contributions , now distributed 50 litres of blood .
traditionally , the community acknow@@ le@@ dges the multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood in the community &apos;s session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is awesome how our body is laid out for it and we pay respect for don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , even un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ised Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the district prepar@@ atory leader of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the preserves are broken down into their constitu@@ ents .

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is likely to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation over an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while maintaining interest rates on family income in the middle of a stronger pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted on 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with less members striving for a rise in this month as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly infl@@ ation@@ ary report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure would continue on domestic income , while inflation in autumn is likely to rise to just under 3 % .
but it sign@@ aled that in the next few years interest increases would be necessary to raise the inflation stimulated by the Bre@@ x@@ it , and she said that credit costs could possibly rise more than anticipated at the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw part of the mamm@@ oth business package which was published one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks over the next February , although it has been said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the rate of interest the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central prog@@ nosis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice as pressure on the real income of households continues to strain consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the rate of interest they repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; somewhat bigger &quot; scale than the markets would expect .
the markets are forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the bank emphas@@ ised that increases would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell according to these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change will come after the recent dis@@ appointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations on interest raising and GDP increased to 0.3 % in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the preceding three months .

the latest infl@@ ation@@ ary report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases , since the tigh@@ tening becomes even worse before it gets better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy could not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ comes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming years , but she added that wages will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year prog@@ nosis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak pound , which will compensate for a proportion of lower consumption expendi@@ tures .
the decision comes one year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the fun@@ nel .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final decision on interest rates , the call for interest rates increased because inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July demanding an increase of 0.5 % .
inflation has fallen from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that this was expected and it would attract them again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that the excess in proportion to its goal of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wholly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the recent decline in swap rates , mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the len@@ ders are looking for shops lou@@ dly looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals are exp@@ ended and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be the controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment after a fight in front of the High Court in September following a fight in the N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis before sexual intercourse ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now delivered from health care via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court uph@@ eld the Supreme Court &apos;s decision last year that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance him .
the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described it as &quot; crucial moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced in all of England in April 2018 .
pre@@ exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV drugs used before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infection risk .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also opt @-@ in for possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the program is £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive purchasing .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting evidence of how it is used , recorded and implemented on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of the biggest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive Officer at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre@@ p , if targeted towards needy and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiations with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Green , CEO of the Ter@@ rence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority now has to be that the study is quickly carried out across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , as the pre@@ p test medicine was acquired , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , shadow health minister , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of delays and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation , Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of delays and hes@@ itation , the government is welcome and over@@ due . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt will bring us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that they will contribute to the cess@@ ation of the spread of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , shr@@ unk from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne hasn &apos;t packed her bags and sold .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first inspection , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for jo@@ ie .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively in order to solve the requirement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were st@@ acked on top of each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only a matter of building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama .
for the mezzanine a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to allow it to work longer .
in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cutlery and j@@ ars of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
collap@@ sible kitchens are nothing new .
the special feature of this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering art went inside , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important , so that when you push the door very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day , you will sell the land - or how your property will be appreciated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious benefit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and that help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical power sockets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself by a good design and an increased square metric number of some standard into something quite amazing .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute over one of the largest real estate imperialist Victori@@ as worth more than 500 million dollars .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors away from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets are to be divided .
Paul wanted to reti@@ re from family business since 2014 , but a sharp conflict over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family purchased a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood in 1973 .
the West@@ co jeans family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail outlets .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money has been invested in real estate and the De LU@@ TI@@ S portfolio now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to an agreement with her dec@@ eased father Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; principal operator and the dominant personality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in owns property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth $ 17@@ 6 million .
the breakdown of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I considered for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place .
the Brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , like Paul claims to have ruled him .
Col@@ in argues that this is not true , but suggests Paul to admini@@ ster some possessions in@@ competent .
in an early aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs increase , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both parties held law firms .
Mrs De LU@@ TI@@ S and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen stores from the late 1950s and bought a store in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood Property , in which Col@@ in opened the first Je@@ ans@@ load of the family .
Col@@ in says he began West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De LU@@ TI@@ S says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S group of companies , with Col@@ in claimed that Mark was paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million in leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has kept himself very restra@@ ined , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
only Col@@ in replied by SMS to say &quot; I really can &apos;t say much &quot; because the case is before the courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul chose to acc@@ use me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , and added that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our issue will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s appointed new Chief of Staff to limit the president &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the White House Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more even course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met on his first working day with senior officers , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s White House which he wanted to repair : poor information that was put into the hands of the President . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring his media diet .
President Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s relationship with television ranges decades back - and now , where he is in the White House , his television commerci@@ als are still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Tru@@ mp was anno@@ yed because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were convincing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February towards Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keeping Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit under control , according to six former electoral campaigns , insi@@ sts that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit was ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps these campaign officials know something that we don &apos;t know about others - that Tru@@ mp@@ s twe@@ ets would have made even more ignition without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp did not send .
if his collabor@@ ators manage to keep anno@@ y@@ ance from him several times , their efforts have paid off .
but nobody has consistently prevented the fact that Tru@@ mp has spark@@ ed controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tru@@ mp material that may promote their views of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ers to supply the President for strategic reasons without question@@ able information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that tru@@ mp can react like a volcano on negative press cuts , especially those with damaging le@@ aks , and that it turns out to find out where they originate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was exactly what happened at the end of February when somebody was malicious a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh to &quot; be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson has been permanently ban@@ ished from Twitter due to ch@@ ic@@ anes or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false alleg@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked them .
Tru@@ mp read the article and started asking employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the general secretary of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still striving for influence .
these un@@ changeable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped .
the police throughout Europe will be sending post@@ cards to dangerous criminals this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
as the addresses of the most sought @-@ after criminals are not known , references from the population will be raised and asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday of the action that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advent calendar from winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experience had shown that many fle@@ eting to vacation destinations were hiding , it was called Euro@@ pol .
21 post@@ cards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries have been compiled .
since 2016 there has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ e@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times this has been viewed .
36 of the online votes could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to evidence after the publication on the website .
travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to &apos; Million@@ aire @-@ Series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some determined travellers on the foot of war , who have negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn by the community to rec@@ laim a field from their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous road of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of vans after they were thrown out in May without having been deter@@ red by a tren@@ ch dug by the Council to prevent their attacks .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense systems and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous resident said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones onto the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced by shame to implement it , as it was useless in dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , were moved forward and are now back again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more came yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Birmingham Council knows how to handle it by holding long teachings to protect her parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue paying my local charge if the Council fails to stop this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a local people who didn &apos;t want to be called : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we &apos;ve just seen the last round of these travelers , just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the Soli@@ hull Council said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with Soli@@ hul@@ ls police . we take the necessary legal steps to keep them moving as quickly as possible .
in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible announce anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling them 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create an image of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof to Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and is to be opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Bir@@ k@@ enhof Hotel through the then ambi@@ ente company company l@@ t@@ d. on April 13 , 2014 , approximately 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also revenue from the tourist tax .
in autumn 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees coming to the district , the hotel building was offered as a collective shelter , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the municipal council .
but above all Freuden@@ stadt Mayor Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious prospective buyers at the house .
he should keep right .
the Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els group with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you will find Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has been standing for some time already before the entrance , and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are done .
the floors have been torn out , ceilings partly de@@ composed , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is a lot to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a beautiful hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest Style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should later become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer puts out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities .
one does not want to be positioned at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale downtown level , Sch@@ erer emphasizes .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread broad@@ ly , explains Sch@@ erer .
individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already held talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , so sha@@ ver .
the performances of the city were identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
according to the level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to determine exactly .
under one million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the external plants are also brought to the front man , which is already clearly visible .
there is a large terrace in a courtyard , which is open to the public by the restaurant that is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : us Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator uses Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tru@@ mp , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller was said to have deployed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent weeks , the committee has received the work , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calling on people familiar with the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the newspaper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller extended and intensified its investigations .
the station CN@@ N reported that there are already first inv@@ itations of the body in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence services have bl@@ amed the Krem@@ lin for a long time , purpos@@ efully interfer@@ ed with the 2016 presidential election campaign .
Mu@@ eller was investigating whether there were agreements between Tru@@ mp@@ s election campaign team and Moscow .
the investigations will focus on several men who acted as advis@@ ors to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also scrut@@ in@@ ised more and more Tru@@ mp@@ s in a private and business environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote several weeks ago that the Sonder@@ erer Tru@@ mp had personally put into the centre and investig@@ ates whether the President might have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ciary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine the present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether it should be charged .
the Grand Jury is therefore also called the Prosec@@ ution .
most of the time they are turned on when they are larger and controversial .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the Board can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor to charge persons for hearing under oath .
according to the CN@@ N station , charges have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
those who participated in the meeting had been asked for a statement , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tru@@ mp J@@ r. , Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s advis@@ er and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his former election boss Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were in the conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the suspension shows that Mu@@ eller would not in@@ timi@@ date himself in his work and that if necessary , he wants to act quickly .
however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the collection of an indictment .
however , the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tru@@ mp .
in the midst of the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to represent Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the history of Russia is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the issue gives the Democrats a chance to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement that he knew nothing about installing a Grand Jury .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I &apos;m usually working secretly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates all measures to expe@@ dite the work of the Special Agent in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fashion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that he was not going to be determined against the president .
there is no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the statement .
but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this expul@@ sion , accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp had become lou@@ der , he wanted to im@@ pe@@ de the judi@@ ciary .
in June , Com@@ ey testified before a Senate committee , Tru@@ mp asked him for an investigation against the former national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
following the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator and its employees .
this triggered speculation as to whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller wants to release Mu@@ eller .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair surrounding the later rejected President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on by the President of the Ministry of Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators set up bills on Thursday , after which the investig@@ ator could no longer be dismissed as simple as possible .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the West@@ ant@@ ar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg desc@@ ended from the scar@@ let @-@ shoe of the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin .
this was confirmed by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the Kol@@ oss , which weighs about 1 tri@@ l@@ lion tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , dri@@ es north@@ wards and will probably need two or three years until it mel@@ ted .
with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that have registered in the past three decades .
it is not a danger for people .
the extent to which climate change has played a role in the decline of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear according to research data .
on the whole , however , there have been a series of unusual breaks of ice @-@ cu@@ dd@@ iness in the region for some 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fac@@ tual background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
so far the Kol@@ oss which has been broken down has been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .
it continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks off .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e was disturbed by the balance of wa@@ xes and breaking @-@ ups a few years ago .
a complete cow@@ ard was torn down there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is in danger as the front edge has never been as far away as it is currently .
in addition , the iron plate stands under tension and can fall apart , if a piece breaks at a key point .
the melting of ice shelf and ic@@ eber@@ gs does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice cre@@ ams as much water as it results after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could potentially raise the sea level , but only slightly , writes the British research project for observing the Antar@@ ctic ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth biggest ice shelf in Antar@@ c@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the open ocean some 200 metres .
it regularly breaks off .
&quot; although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; under scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will grow back or go back in the long term and possibly collapse , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Our models say that it will be less stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these researchers do not reverse the demo@@ lition of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many ice @-@ co@@ aters of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades .
this long skirt of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to the research program of the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med up around three degrees in the past 50 years , counting on the areas where the temperature is the quick@@ est .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f to staff
because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U demands to leave the employers association to become more attractive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just before the summer break , the working @-@ day has gained 41 new positions in the administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 1,@@ 100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now , 17 trainees have completed their first working day .
the teachers in the circle are obviously very sought after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were recorded for the places that were in place this year .
nevertheless , the group still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
currently there are still 50 vac@@ ant positions in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann .
doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration , are sought .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative jointly with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG to counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to meet not only short @-@ term demand for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application shortage .
the overall concept should orient@@ ate itself in@@ war@@ dly and extern@@ ally , show concrete measures for cross @-@ entry and involve an education campaign , demanding CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that you did not know before .
other cities adver@@ tise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of the public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a high number of employees who leave the service illness or age @-@ related .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is time to act so that even more jobs will remain un@@ occupied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , president of the CD@@ U , still go beyond the common application with his party .
he made a big surprise already in the day of the circle , when he publicly challenged personnel costs and start@@ led the rest of the parties .
people want all possibilities to be reviewed which allow discharge from the municipal employers association .
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice , the county administration with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should strive for a Hau@@ te @-@ rate , &quot; nations .
so the CD@@ U tries to pay the employees and officials better than it actually fores@@ ees the tari@@ ffs for public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money is available only when you move to a higher level , which is oriented to professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution law .
last but not least by the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone on migrant rescue boats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they cannot continue this unless they comply with new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Interior Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis &apos;s warning came a day after Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German relief organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their crew had worked together effectively with traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express himself in detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor of Ambro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , saving lives is our top priority . so we are sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all accus@@ ations currently raised after collecting all the information and assessing the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had monitored the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October .
it is thought that the crew will take the ding@@ h@@ y migrants aboard , which will be delivered directly from traffi@@ ckers , and that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can turn off so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s acts , whose contents were published by Italian media .
the crew is suspected to over@@ ride the authority of the Italian coast@@ guard , which monitors the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must above all have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate organization Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
in the meantime , Minn@@ iti once said that the number of migrants entering Italy after the rescue measures has declined sharply in recent weeks , indicating that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe .
An@@ sti@@ ege and Tri@@ als
&quot; &quot; &quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bik@@ er , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate for four days to enjoy tri@@ als and sights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were three friendly guides available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome bonus .
the first tour led to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim during hot summer temperatures .
there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest and the up@@ stream plains .
in between there were repeat@@ ed@@ ely long queu@@ es for the long trials .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once again , a viewpoint at the viewpoint , connected by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flo@@ at@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the last two days a lot of altitude metres were announced again .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and mountain huts brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed cur@@ ative br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .

after 17@@ 3 kilometres and nearly 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group met the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporting and cultural .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga presents itself for e @-@ sport
are the sports stars in the future in front of computer consoles , rather than struggling with wind and weather over the stadium racing ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high guests included .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have also recognized the first Bundes@@ liga , who are increasingly involved in this field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 followed the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sports department in mid @-@ July and two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire quite new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are still several associations going on on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organizes the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified for example .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the former coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people still go into the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent E @-@ athletes under contract , one could be much more present on these markets online than to send only once a year to the federal government to Asia .
what is it all about ?
in the event of e @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the FIFA World Cup are fo@@ iled at a competition level .
as in normal sports , the pros have long established themselves , in which the pros are competing against each other .
and by 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official programme .
but is it all about a proper sport ?
for many , the performance is definitely getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bing has also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport , because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical responses that you find in classic sports - such as increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , it needs cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction capacity .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console but also their bodies and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ l also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more an issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls were difficult to perform on online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing .
the scientist emphasizes the high integr@@ ative effect of E @-@ sport .
the players are on the road internationally , which is like a big global family , there are no inter@@ cultural barriers .
a study by the Unternehmens@@ beratung Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
in three years , sales are expected to lie at 130 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; admitt@@ edly , this is little against the € 2.4 billion in the Bundes@@ liga . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte Consul@@ tant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
internationally , many countries are already on the move .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team NR@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport @-@ competitions Uni@@ kr@@ n .
a lot is happening in Europe too .
in a Norwegian school , E @-@ sport was introduced as a lesson , says F@@ rob@@ bing .
in the Netherlands and France , according to D@@ utt , the football league clubs are obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison Germany dec@@ lines Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ CEO R@@ ött@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to decay only in nostal@@ gia and to clarify the old times is not enough today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but also to align the company with the modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digital@@ ised world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thinks D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t stick to it that only football stays the way it was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter condemned to suicide because of the lyrics that Conrad Roy pushing for suicide
a Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls for suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were suspended on prob@@ ation .
Carter was convic@@ ted in June for the neg@@ ligent murder of Conrad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is in@@ consol@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until his appointment .
she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Carter was standing there with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she ended his life in order to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown regret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters At@@ tor@@ ney said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance which they depl@@ ore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Ju@@ dge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he didn &apos;t find that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness had a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a public prosec@@ utor read an explanation of Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no day when I don &apos;t have the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for eternity in spite of all my sor@@ rows that we will carry with us for eternity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , testified that she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that she would never take part in the marriage of her brother or be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer this single person with whom I have been together every day since I was born , is a pain that I will always keep with myself for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to commit another , commit suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang on , spring from a building , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that by any press she should benefit from the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Carter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder of her British fellow resident in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , posted a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ mir : learning from the new mini @-@ lens of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ mir was allowed to run for the Audi Cup as a captain is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern won a big season for the Con@@ fed Cup winner - there is no harm to extra motivation .
something was different in his place in the cabin , that Joshua Kim@@ mir immediately saw me , even though the additional piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp L@@ und and no Manuel Neu@@ er were to be seen , he made the rush to his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner afterwards , after his first deployment as Bavaria captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the entry could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign from the coach could also indicate Kim@@ mir .
not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f , made up of youth players , de@@ bu@@ ters and just off holidays , but he .
sugar is preferably distributed to those who have a lot to do , which one wants to keep in a mood .
those who have been chosen to take on the heritage of L@@ ept@@ une can only use a little extra motivation .
Kim@@ mir confirmed : &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fl@@ es@@ hed across the field as a mini @-@ runner .
right behind , that &apos;s his position , the white Bin@@ de on his arm did the rest .
and at all Kim@@ mir worked in this starting formation like the one who can best take the ru@@ dder in his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ well played tro@@ upe .
he had a look for the whole while many others were busy with himself .
V@@ idal thus , to over@@ play his missing fitness ( barely folds ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on the de@@ vil@@ s , come out to the achievements of the Asia @-@ trip ( fold also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le were not neg@@ atively affected by their first appearance in the Bayern Tri@@ cot .
after all , it worked out very well .
Sü@@ le went to Kim@@ mir , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both acted sovereign .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and Sü@@ le also tried a couple of times in the play @-@ up .
his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; not as we hoped it . &quot;
but he also showed a good performance in the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game storage , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also fet@@ ched for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as usual this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the newcom@@ ers , one saw following the game afterwards .
for example , Ru@@ dy did not give one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but determined six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ mir said goodbye to his new fellow players after a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard an interesting proposition from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you simply have to win every game in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises d@@ ress@@ ings speed
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is reflected in more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V inquiry about a change in economic policy - and at the same time add the old minister .
Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing gras@@ ps the wishes of the economy which has all blocked Lem@@ ke . &quot;
the largest turn@@ around is natural in infrastructure policy : the gap between the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
this year the Ministry hopes for a planning process until 2021 should be the construction law .
a role in the plans of the country also allu@@ des to the west circum@@ fence of Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Office of Transport .
the aim is to put the track into operation in December 2020 , says Minister of the Interior , Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
nat@@ us sees this as a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of Commerce ( Chamber of Commerce ) ( Chamber of Commerce ) stri@@ ves , as is stimulated by Wis@@ sing , to raise a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label at the wine to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports since 10 years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people wanting to establish their own company , the Chamber of Commerce pra@@ ises .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier offers an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new master bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 euros is planned for the passed championship test and 2500 euros if graduates will be self @-@ employed within ten years after the master &apos;s training .
but the home@@ work schedule for the country remains long .
according to Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , the main managing director of the Chamber of Commerce , Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , the main managing director of the Chamber of Commerce , said :
of 56 new engineers who want to recru@@ it Wis@@ sing at state @-@ owned mobility , only 29 jobs have been occupied until now .
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
CD@@ U cau@@ cus Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf pointed to the calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country is investing more than 20 million euros in the preservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018 .
in addition , Frank nat@@ us expects a concept of the country as to how it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
sober@@ ing is the broad@@ band expansion in the country .
in 2016 regional companies had rated net supply in an I@@ HK survey only with a score of 3,@@ 4 .
they are compla@@ ining about stagn@@ ating internet connections and out@@ breaks .
former Minister of Economy E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits on the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private college in Karlsruhe , where it already cleared the field after four months due to in@@ consisten@@ cies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Audi is expected to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - automobile manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction
one day before Audi &apos;s announcement , BMW said that it would offer the software to update in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
the BMW Group said the company believes that &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; and thus applied to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to prohi@@ bit or restrict diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles to be modified in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support the compliance of rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of autom@@ akers to install equipment to neutr@@ alize the exhaust gases em@@ itted by diesel vehicles also take on what makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of bl@@ aming the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called switch @-@ off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were charged , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics in the engine development of Audi was arrested in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be put to trial in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was included in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been expanded .
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could seriously strain Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s winning .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft travels through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message .
if you want to go back to Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and this is not a normal raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the building department wants to clear up .
on the raft you can see a big Inf@@ otran@@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a garbage dump .
the start of a campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to shar@@ pen the understanding of the Is@@ ar as a worthy game of wildlife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
already last summer the raft ran over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behaviour .
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ ol@@ n@@ oses and the Lau@@ ghter Against the suffering
at times Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most widely published carto@@ ons , the ni@@ es of his characters are his trademark .
also with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still working on a film .
his message : laughter because there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he proposed himself as a drawer for greetings cards - what frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris he was able to make a breakthrough at the end of the 60 &apos;s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again , the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures are ro@@ cking in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own data , he still sits on the drawing table , working every day for almost ten hours .
over cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches , his dro@@ ll figures continue to spread widely worldwide .
he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters for six years .
the main character in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - which has a jack of thousands as a counterpart .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film that will come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ di@@ llo writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
that is why he rather focuses on the TV series , which , as his original drawings , is produced verb@@ ally .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence is threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
la@@ ven@@ der is , due to the conditions reminiscent of dro@@ ught and due to diseases transmitted diseases , which scientists and farmers are trying to find solutions causing great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert in the CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years , which in spring brought much less rain and in autumn much more .
this has effects on the lifetime of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a small ch@@ ic@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transfers d@@ warf @-@ goats , and in very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there is a lot in the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the solutions that are considered include a better distribution of water and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dro@@ ught .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1,@@ 200 year anniversary .

the assassination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the Week@@ ly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure : they are supposed to take their children to the office , which in 2009 were the goal of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or leaving them at home .
security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies .
they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary to submit percep@@ tions and stomach feelings .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the government &apos;s pay@@ roll or cart@@ els , a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no break from violence , and while the bodies are pil@@ ing up throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to has been in office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 after attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .
among the latter is her editor and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep though his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Building . two re@@ porters in the 1930 &apos;s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mares , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a special prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was established in 2010 to handle the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders connected every year with drug trafficking and organised crime , journalists are rarely tried by journalists .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are in@@ consol@@ able and although the terrain is now more tre@@ ach@@ erous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without information about the murder@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefits , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we are all str@@ anded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; twel@@ fth river . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
ru@@ mo@@ urs tend to move around freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country since rival fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that one or more people are shot in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug king@@ doms , which are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes to the United States .
nevertheless and despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was crushed with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
at first there was in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed gang@@ sters bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was not to force Val@@ dez , after requ@@ esting another newspaper , which had published the same story , to leave the country for its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to set up Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without hitting the drug problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , sales and advertising .
re@@ porters dar@@ ed to publish hard @-@ fitting investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to handle .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her coverage in Latin America .
in the same year Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award for the protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history , wherever it led .
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task you &apos;ve acquired as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ my . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you tell what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who cur@@ ses like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is his love for routine his destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death has also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her job and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean businesses , their secret starting and run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
if it smells wrong , stay away from it .
the anger is , the publisher of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to J@@ avier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , no mobile phones were allowed . days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ class neighbourhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in joke , some of the re@@ porters questioned whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who the Gover@@ nor described as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is months since the re@@ porters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the edition of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has focused on three main stories .
there was the assassination of brother of former well @-@ known Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state expendi@@ tures focused on the city &apos;s hom@@ etown .
and there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block away from the office of the prosec@@ utor , conducted a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug traffi@@ ckers and authorities .
a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolutionary Party ( PR@@ I ) , who ruled almost all the political planes throughout the century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ profile incidents of corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few months earlier , the readers of Val@@ dez had considered the best information about ab@@ duction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers that protest against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the staff have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez grab@@ bed a few signs and went the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its .
journalists all over the country have become more lou@@ der by writing in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez leaves Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ciary in the Val@@ dez case .
during a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they told the truth .
she has since then asked her to be re @-@ divided by the government because she is worried that her anger viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; society &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were infected with organised crime under a ceiling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media @-@ guard group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and civil servants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; R@@ ami@@ rez said .
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border @-@ state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Cart@@ el : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones lay beside her separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the daily El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assassination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana was doing by Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of its director in 2004 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the front page titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as it seems to the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue their work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that drug trafficking is frigh@@ tened by him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that &apos;s why I became a re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer , when suddenly all their phones began to h@@ um .
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with tape riv@@ ales and security forces near the seaside resort of Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed deaths .
the war continued to escal@@ ate , as promised by a number of Kart@@ ell em@@ b@@ assi@@ es in the region .
from the ker@@ bs , they have posted the news on the Ri@@ odo@@ ce website about mobile phones .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ ens grew up close by - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a glance at the polic@@ emen who kept watch to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid at all , they did not show it .
under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his traces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the same day J@@ avier was murdered , the practitioner asked me to send them to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening one .
researchers have now found out that the first findings of the incredible N@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mountain worker were so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even find that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they had something of an &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report published in the magazine &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reserved &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , which lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period .
his unbeliev@@ ably well @-@ preserved condition has astonished scientists who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es are the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he dug in the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
he met something out of the surrounding rock out of the place , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years discovering the wild animal inside the 2500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth @-@ lum@@ ps .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you b@@ link a little with your eyes , you could almost believe it has slept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chief author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum where the creature is to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although covered with arm@@ or and resembles a shifting tank , probably was threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as a counter@@ fei@@ ting , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to ming@@ le better in its surroundings and avoid its enemies , experts say what was suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by bigger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million year old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild beast and called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli according to the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours researching it carefully .
the surprising preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ our over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds the animals living today .
it points to the fact that the din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by meat eating din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution fav@@ oured the conce@@ al@@ ment of the confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of roe deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , which sign@@ alizes that this No@@ dose au@@ r@@ rier was subjected to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong predat@@ ory behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es must have been the chal@@ k time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to examine the animal for clu@@ es about his life , including his conden@@ sed performer , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern flu@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dose @-@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but remains in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early part of the circle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you &apos;re just playing a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it is asleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors .
this includes the ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he dug in the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on 21 March 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the reserved ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that hung from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were sw@@ amped by western Canada , until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the underwater hull of the din@@ osau@@ r kept its arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the cut@@ est cover still b@@ ump@@ y tank plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as rare as winning in the lot@@ to .
the more I approach it , the more confusing it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin cover still the b@@ ump@@ y tank plates carrying the skull of the animal .
his right front foot rests on his side , his five fingers are spread to the top .
I can count the scales at his sole . &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass kar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , miles @-@ long hours - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the Autobahn Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon .
according to the first data of the police , between the outlets Adel@@ ant@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) , about 30 vehicles , among them probably trucks , crashed into each other at 5 : 00 p.m .
there are no indications of the exact number of the injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a matter of light to moderate injuries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large bid for rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely locked in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich an approximately ten @-@ kilometre long back@@ log was formed .
like an A@@ Z re@@ porter , it also came on the counter @-@ track to massive han@@ di@@ caps - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade noted the characteristics of the vehicle drivers , who now have to reck@@ on with delicate pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 , a second accident occurred at the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : you sit in the train and sleep .
or one is en@@ gros@@ sed in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ alo .
comes the conductor and awak@@ ens a sen@@ sel@@ ess or pul@@ ls the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket control .
one simply confirms by mobile phone that one has taken his place and thus evalu@@ ates the ticket .
currently , a test run runs on two tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the offer , we expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be available on many other routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the train ticket de@@ valuation without creativity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use them , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have booked an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
you also have to buy it via the app of the train , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway .
last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : one climbs into the train , calling his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a button for the electronic de@@ valuation appears in the test customers .
the train companions receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
if the train companion arrives at the ticket control at place Y he knows that there is a passenger with already de@@ valu@@ ated online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , keep on working , keep silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should take advantage of passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to travel comfortably without any ticket control by our train atten@@ dant , simply check in the DB Navigator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , member of the marketing board of DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket control checks are among the biggest off@@ ences .
because often you have , in any case , however one of the fellow travelers do not have all the documents you need to de@@ valu@@ ate online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document you have to show .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passengers , which leads to bad mood in the part or large room and delays in controlling their own tickets and takes the time to take care of other matters .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this applies only to the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sha@@ ken to its core .
only one day after she arrived in New York City , she was sitting in St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a post from someone from high school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as nobody else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on her tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ uson , Mo . , live on twe@@ ets .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thought Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she dropped her mobile phone to return to T@@ we@@ ets on the Can@@ field drive later in the evening .
there were photos of police and people crying out , and from a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns father who had a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ uson police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman reas@@ sured his gun and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not usual , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt ch@@ ills .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and cried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 11 o &apos;clock , she fet@@ ched her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that they would go to F@@ erg@@ uson the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ uson is the theme of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinem@@ as starting at the 11th .
it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and power of resistance stem@@ ming from the perspective of people living in the community and having filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter , wearing a flower dress and a matching crown , drove to F@@ erg@@ uson , the two discussed a conversation that they had many times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ uson because the police have killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take her away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know and see it and be re@@ ared in it .
it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to get free to free ourselves .
even though I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blat@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep them away from them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station when they arrived at F@@ erg@@ uson was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists waited for the potential non @-@ accus@@ ation of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter were joined by a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to prot@@ esters .
slowly , a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism totally changed after 9 August , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and noticed that she was President of the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met with Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one question came from Fer@@ rel@@ l : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often by wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resili@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently said in an interview , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ uson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ ct in@@ mates .
his involvement brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other indigenous people followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me , how these people are represented , because so I shall be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ells &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a Messiah @-@ leader but a community coming together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most open participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ells &apos;s life as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ ells &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the overall movement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that is why we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but she insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook her energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no coincidence , although it was at the forefront of the game , because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel her energy through the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ uson have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
but she still cl@@ ings to a song and she feels bound to this memory since she went into F@@ erg@@ uson three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ at@@ ren@@ zy &quot; : TV readers discuss bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though it hasn &apos;t been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been spl@@ itting the population in pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the subject is hardly cold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the topic is discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some say to the bit gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; does not need a person &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ del@@ usion ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) .
while pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , of which the rest of the shops also benefit , the opponents fear that then the pedestrian prec@@ inct is bleeding .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct markets offer their products .
at the beginning of the construction work will be concluded .
the Galerie @-@ M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility to sit outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Simone Zimmer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been selling almost weekly in the farmers market for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land women again and again very gladly .
we have also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like to see that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing is located in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it might not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s the shopping centre in Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets , I find that unnecessary .
there is already enough in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer and is reasonably priced at the top .
as you can see , retail stores are rented in a shopping mall only by larger firms , because the local r@@ ents are often not tra@@ dable for a retailer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; too bad , special shops almost no longer exist and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit into Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market hall be present during construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes out sometime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or does the ghost bit gallery already manage to sell all the shops out of Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that will simply not work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and no one needs a shopping center that is empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to have a real farmer &apos;s market , instead of this gallery .
but there &apos;s no room for a farmer &apos;s market thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess building projects in Bit@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the farmers market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing &apos;s DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ ti@@ bly similar - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st pressed a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after being classified as secret diplomatic messages about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on August 2 , is called a Bec@@ oming St@@ resem@@ b@@ lance ( a matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combines her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and a ground@@ breaking dissi@@ dent whose sentence was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA that could be extracted by Mann@@ ing and created out of the 30 portraits , as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look , a sharp , though some intellectual comment not just about the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the law of es@@ pi@@ onage , computer fraud and theft .
her picture was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie in which Mann@@ ing visi@@ bly sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came just from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette but@@ ts and che@@ wing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to produce an image of how these people could look .
that was the time she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she couldn &apos;t attend this time and she couldn &apos;t be photographed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a portrait of a DNA .
the artist and her imprisoned m@@ use became un@@ equal spectac@@ les , which in the course of two years exchanged several letters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they even created a comic illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which fores@@ aw a future in which the President of Chelsea would convert judgment and it would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome type of happy coincidence .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tru@@ mp performs a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender forces in order to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to infl@@ ame the rigid divisions that he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a particular reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called with her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her sur@@ name is marked with a heart ) an end to &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ fold of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific lex@@ icon of the artist ) , as surprisingly similar , at least in biological respect , we are all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people hopefully will take with them is that our gen@@ ome will not take care of who we are and how openly genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic novel .
she shows Mann@@ ing how she appears with a hands @-@ free phone in her hand from the United States of the United States of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they make your speech cold , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not yet seen the exhibition in person - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ons , who gather together like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also aimed at how everything was written in the exhibition , up to size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had her on the wall , but I wanted her to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed by Chelsea , like the movement that stuck behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for killing
a nationwide human @-@ hunt is in progress for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee at Oxford University , who are looked after as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injury .
on Monday for murder of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued arrest warran@@ ts on the basis of murder of Cook County &apos;s County Court .
the documents tell that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches .
a common warning system published by the Chicago Police Department is that the cor@@ pse was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead in the place of events , and det@@ ectives investigating the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police actively seek the two susp@@ ects said officials .
since 2007 , La@@ them has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ ete , the vice @-@ president of university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them was now being assessed and excluded from entering the campus of the Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal case examined by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co @-@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ ete . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speaker of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the UK police and are ready to help U.S. investig@@ ators in any way possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to be .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly ur@@ ges the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce each other , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip that said something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will finish the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the timetable , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA schedule was updated in this regard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of WA@@ DA &apos;s road@@ map to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re @-@ establishing R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not include anything that might cause concern for Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the results of the examination approved by the WA@@ DA by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on alleged state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has gotten a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
but there were no government programs , and we won &apos;t give anything that does not exist . &quot;
Mut@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission .
talking to the Russian sales outlet at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov agreed to problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has proposed to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the WA@@ DA by conducting dop@@ ing control in Russia in the course of dop@@ ing sc@@ and@@ als .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow organization in July , WA@@ DA Director , Olivier Nig@@ gli , declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moving in the right direction in order to be used again .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure happiness with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the p@@ olls did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - dec@@ eit@@ ful .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has called people from outside to help .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at the wa@@ xing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to perform surveys , offer special groups and demographic groups , employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers permit to circum@@ vent the C @-@ suite executives and address directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
saved as a favorite to look at new things you post ... &#124; Hello , just wanted to mention , I liked this article . it was funny . keep oon posting ! &#124;
in addition to the Sn@@ ap P@@ olls and P@@ olls of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows which units have most complaints and which executives have low approval outcomes - so you can re@@ boot , why .
companies come to see that they have to stay at the forefront of workplace culture so that you do not become the next U@@ ber , who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als , since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment in which those who have spoken have been punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ LIN@@ T this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and compliance sector could be worth more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the financial website of Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
converter has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
he has recently registered as a client .
like G@@ LIN@@ T , Conver@@ cent allows companies to send tailored &quot; Pul@@ s- &quot; P@@ olls , collect sensitive answers in real @-@ time , and view the heat cards of your problem areas .
it also provides an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , which allows employees to report bad behavior .
and if the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public opinion has included regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that treats its employees poorly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has appointed Conver@@ cent for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
previously , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to prosec@@ ute the complaints of employees .
now that the Enterprise Conver@@ cent uses , problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed more quickly - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment li@@ tigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Engagement in 2002 , after Arthur Ander@@ sen &apos;s accounting firm collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron scandal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right &quot; that companies recognized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Conver@@ cent offer their software as a service , and debit the companies with recurring charges for using their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
in February Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million .
a total of $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners secured his entire funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing research complex that shows that today &apos;s employees are expecting more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets like Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only stak@@ es .
the staff want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their votes , and that the work that you do is worth it , then feel stronger to make this company successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In who uses both Conver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors reach returns when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
when the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ aker of a company does not take action .
in fact , when a company asks staff about your feedback , it can have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come fast enough or not at all , this can breed dis@@ appointments and dem@@ oti@@ fy employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask about 4,000 suggestions , you must be prepared to have 4,000 talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the business management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that rely too much on collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow the staff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem related to G@@ LIN@@ T is reported .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize multiple teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always receives new insights on the employees , and it hopes that in the long term , this leads to a better bond of workers in an industry known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers then you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it goes to 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A foot@@ ball@@ ers enter@@ tain on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their jer@@ sey parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these idle minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in the Summer Cour@@ ses will return to their final exam after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center next morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the boys , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday to Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ CL@@ A should start at 7 : 15 PM to meet the already fully packed schedule of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood performed practical exercises .
they are supposed to do 18 exercises over August . 20 before the beginning of formal preparations for their start against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he supported the change of rules of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the multi@@ busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they move on , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will stop their practices once the camp is finished , which in view of the clear sight of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjoining Lus@@ kin Center , a high @-@ class hotel that has already been ki@@ cked with foot balls , which will scra@@ pe a protective net behind a door@@ post , will not be an easy task .
Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then sett@@ ling there to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video tape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third parties and show their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network said on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect potential false reports and send them to fac@@ tual surveys that may display results of the fact check out of the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they also have influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan that social media networks should be punished if they do not manage to quickly eradic@@ ate hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review will be launched in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the recognition which stories of fac@@ tual test@@ ers are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to be testing its feature to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ ies and 1980 @-@ s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his comfortable seat in the Be@@ w@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and now has become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a Yor@@ k@@ shire m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , emerging British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des which is based on an archive : it wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expectedly emotional .
&quot; I just responded to the thumb@@ print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &quot; s that worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb pressure ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell smoke , because at that time a fire was lit for the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were also involved .
Ah , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( &quot; To be honest : I &apos;ve over@@ rated my welcome greeting , &quot; ) it seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in dit@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape pat@@ rons , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access only in 2006 , when the last hei@@ rs , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which aristoc@@ rats said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , cards that represent who possessed something : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could think that country conflicts would be boring , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guys , let everything go its way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to sink into English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of an u@@ pro@@ ar that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &quot; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex , &quot; Rho@@ des says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like The Pri@@ est , which tells the story of Jesu@@ it pat@@ rons , who hid the family Dar@@ rel@@ l for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gler is depicted Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; gentlemen seemed to be a cro@@ ok , always making debts and spending money on things they could not afford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men solved their debt crisis by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking guys , with a talent to promote Er@@ win . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the end of his deployment in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences
he has taken a two week stay in Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go again , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the closure of the 30@@ 1 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f has launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) on Friday .
even until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep the logo and slogan confidential .
at the end of August there will be a festival on Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th Island as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking for the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think this ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote on her website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that as a Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizen , we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it is said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , she is competing with other local authorities .
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f can pay a mid @-@ five @-@ figure amount to its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on reti@@ re@@ es and promotions in the officer &apos;s cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal procedure .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
the meeting did not take place in the building of the general staff , as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the He@@ ads of Government , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and Minister of Defence , Interior , Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part in the proceedings .
in this way , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the number .
the government attracts the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed .
since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the Ex@@ ile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as the wire @-@ driver of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 persons who have been directly involved in the attempted coup attempt has been negotiated in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the coup attempt as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gift of God &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely clean@@ se the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan is really in control of the army ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published an article titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ ease in Military Head@@ quarters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the General Staff , there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the head@@ cover ban for soldiers , wrote the paper .
in any case , the major rein@@ for@@ cements of the army and the security forces continue .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan report@@ edly fired another 73@@ 95 public servants , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the lords of the country .
three times they appe@@ aled to their role as Guardi@@ ans of the secular state order .
following his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed the power of the military step by step , not least calling on the reform agenda of the European Union .
former officers say , Erdo@@ gan has targeted milit@@ arization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer , who was seeking asylum after the attempted coup attempt , would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a few years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if that is true , such a development could not let Nato get cold .
anyway , in the alliance after the pur@@ ges , there are doubts about the readiness to use the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , quoted by the media .
he prefers to reduce the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the draft law should be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do this by the US to change the way citizens are issued from other countries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate circuit for the shuttle bus
over the past few months , over the past few months , over the future of the S@@ utt@@ les S@@ utt@@ les has been denied - now it is supposed to be very fast .
at the end of the year it is planned to be built on the ailing road on which the tourist train runs .
according to the Ministry of Transport , construction works are scheduled to commen@@ ce in the long term in order to secure the future of the S@@ utt@@ les R@@ utt@@ les .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g route , the country is well known for its tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Transport Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the repair of the track was estimated at about 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country sur@@ passes 75 percent .
the contract , on which the shuttle will also be ordered in the future from the country , is currently finally agreed , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the South Thurin@@ gian railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a duration of eleven years .
this means that the Race Shuttle will be ordered regularly by December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular railway connection between the train stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
in recent months , a pilot plant has been tested to determine whether the route is being used by a large number of people in order to order it again in the future .
in addition , the track is heavily b@@ ump@@ y in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
just as you thought it could not be even more crazy in 2017 , a new report about technological developments in the area of sex robots will come .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Rob@@ otik ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we need to start taking their ascen@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of them and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey at the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern exp@@ u@@ sions have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adjust &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes even more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman look progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern exp@@ u@@ pping have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion using pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female characteristics , the allu@@ sions to rape , when one goes a step to fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. , resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , rest@@ less one most .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy has a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy .
their origins and their increasing sophistic@@ ation point to somewhat darker and deeper into our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as an optional en@@ core .
most men will of course not keep sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notices its increasing popularity , they still remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what tran@@ spir@@ es out of the marginal zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly evolved sex robots are appearing in a time when the rights of women are threatened all over the world in which there is a president in the White House , who has promised to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most horrible aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the hand@@ maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the swal@@ lowed body and the po@@ unding eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .
the aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to real women as real@@ istically as possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots pose no real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot be separated from their companion or simply go away .
they have no mediation or background story , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission .
in other words , they are counter@@ f@@ eit slaves .
or to put it in the Rede@@ mption of 2017 : maid girls
Tru@@ mp@@ s great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney an ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense
it has become a tru@@ ce of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions that have pol@@ arized the U.S. elec@@ torate , have also split families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving Day there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tru@@ mp &apos;s relatives .
we are all trying to make our filter bubbles burst .
less noticed is the power of Tru@@ mp@@ s to bring together families .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ right poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family for a long time , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tru@@ mp in the White House , everyone whom she knows , including the republi@@ can kin@@ ship , with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and wholly strange on the same side .
around the dining table that is certainly a good thing , but it falls to me in a further context that this also brings significant risks .
the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; we refer to the cru@@ el@@ ly possibility that his k@@ itt@@ ens will not be rep@@ elled one day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there is still a more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario , in which Tru@@ mp re@@ public@@ ans the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison with its standards .
today I think of an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax returns ) - both in comparison to Tru@@ mp are indeed a very mild crime .
when Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must only be mentally healthy in order to qualify as im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York Parks Department , and the top three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cr@@ un@@ chy and the animals twist to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ per@@ mitting music con@@ veys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not over the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the topic pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not counting - but a big round@@ about in the north of London .
the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magical experience , as here two two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can walk on it and have all a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street , it is the same , plus the option to pay the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this does not only result in a slow@@ down of what is actually a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required .
the poor woman in the department store stood ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tically gr@@ ins@@ ing while I was tired of making her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts to his hand joints , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell .
on the occasion of murder , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence by an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 , firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a noc@@ turn@@ al intru@@ der who hid himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say they are too transparent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National law enforcement agency said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us risks that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .

as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the Vier@@ t@@ kl@@ äss@@ ler from F@@ itt@@ ens and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and the secondary schools .
three of the students went to college in the future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , School Director Angel@@ ika S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 students of the four classes headed by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der chose a young eagle growing up in the hen farm , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the lower band performed a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The eagle in the hen farm &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to breed from its chickens .
instead of a chicken herd , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of him was crum@@ bling ; the eagle had spread out his wings on a high mountain .
after that the classes showed three and four in the recording of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , who wore cylinders to make the bet .
the Eagle stands for integration , said school director Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
the young animal is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
she wished every four @-@ t@@ amer that he felt accepted in his new school .
the following followed thanks to the colleagues , the former school director Michael Müller , who always starts with lessons and the parents &apos; representatives .
the cu@@ cum@@ ber time is over , class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher said .
after two years of teaching , she left school very reluct@@ ant , as it had been a really great time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , they can rely on the Vier@@ t@@ kl@@ äss@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , all students had a song of summer time and holiday season .
with the children , great joy broke out .
eight first @-@ grade students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , divided the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television .
on the morning of 1 August , a group of illeg@@ ally killing people was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released , while an investigation is currently underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated the control of the free camp and lay claim to anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose .
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
must diesel drivers take part in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.@@ 3 million cars .
they should improve the emission characteristics of cars from emission classes Euro 5 and in part Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 dies@@ els or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action obligatory ?
no , the software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously apply only to vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the retro@@ fit ordered by the Federal Motor Transport Authority ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a swift implementation in the coming months , but not yet called an exact date .
Daimler has announced to write to every affected person .
if an inspection is due anyway , that will be done in its framework .
how long will the retro@@ fit be drawn up altogether ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from the political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen that the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do , which do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE advises you to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would reti@@ re , so S@@ met@@ e@@ anin .
does a massive price fall of Euro @-@ 4 cars now threaten ?
the ACE fears this .
but in the regions where the b@@ ans are threatening .
in rural areas , there is so far no loss of value for older diesel .
the ACE advises to wait for sale .
ll Cool J received Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize giving to President Tru@@ mp promises to become political .
one of the lau@@ re@@ ates does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets the first ra@@ pper one of the cov@@ eted awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
this year singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the honored .
the awards are handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tru@@ mp will host a reception and participate with his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony .
the award winner Le@@ ar , announced with progressive TV series , already announced that he would not miss the participation in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presi@@ dency has decided to neglect the arts and human rights completely - even depri@@ ving them of the means - and that is bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that she will use Tru@@ mp to make her view clearer .
the Kennedy Center , named after former president , John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital .
the former prize winners are Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city liv@@ able
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs City Engineer , will reti@@ re next year .
the place is already written out - suitable applicants are however ra@@ r .
for the past 31 years , W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been .
and the work is still great fun for him , as he arran@@ ges in the press conference .
he reports on varied but challenging tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , he is surprised that no application has yet been applied to the requirement profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
so - considering the regular notice periods - should still be enough time for a famili@@ ar@@ isation .
since Has@@ lach works for the Administr@@ ative Community as Lower building rights authority , the applicant must show appropriate degrees .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if it would no longer be able to fill it , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg .
but the proximity to the city is important to the city and itself , says W@@ acker , who reports about a good working climate as well as good atmosphere between authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , several major projects have accumulated , looking back on the h@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is confident about the building office and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen park@@ platz are encountered .
the zig@@ z@@ ag bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still subject to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will strike at around 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes W@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
in terms of design , there is plenty of room for a city builder .
Has@@ la@@ chs &apos;s own building yard and gar@@ dener can be re@@ acted flexibly on many occasions .
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors .
since the ol@@ d@@ town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what fits in &quot; when new buildings are approved , emphas@@ ises the out@@ going town builder .
in any case , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister bears high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything works here over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , that his successor remains long , W@@ acker hopes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and remain with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city .
if you want to bury Roland W@@ acker , after information from the city of Has@@ lach , you should be able to instruc@@ t a completed degree as a diploma engineer or a b@@ achel@@ or with the subject of architecture and have good technical knowledge in the fields of construction and construction planning law .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ( Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ) under@@ goes civil and civil engineering , construction planning , underground facilities , administration of urban property , municipal farm with building yard and city nur@@ series as well as Lower building rights authority , including monument protection .
bike thrown on lines : Süd@@ bahnhof locked
according to the police , the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bike off the railway track in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the leader@@ ships .
these were so severely damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out from two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since the night .
near the scene of the crime , a ros@@ y sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Lus@@ ati@@ an empire , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesman Christoph Pos@@ ch on the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ator would have brought himself into great danger and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the system , as well as the delay of delay and the cost of rail replacement traffic , pat@@ rons of the railway customers could also come to the perpetrators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum went out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was rec@@ tified on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the south railway track could be guided without disabilities .
just under ten passenger suits were dropped on Friday morning , two of which concerned the long @-@ distance traffic .
freight trains failed , but they had delayed .
according to Ö@@ BB spokesman Christoph Pos@@ ch , about 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate may sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study says exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the inc@@ urable condition affecting approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while suffer@@ ers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the intest@@ ines to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hiding in the food do not penetrate the body .
cells capable of trig@@ gering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue .
if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
experiments have shown that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell in mice occurs that carry a specific bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal portion of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promotes more tolerant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ li@@ eus , if the same system also s@@ wir@@ ls in people .
post @-@ doctoral researcher Dr Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was separated , did not have this .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi which normally live in the ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal tract .
the mice of the mice were sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species were found that were present in mice with immune cells , but without them in mice .
mice were taken up in a sterile environment so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received L. reu@@ ter@@ i and immune cells .
in order to understand how bacteria acted to the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i were able to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to im@@ mature immune cells that were isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed into the tolerant cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of the mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same tolerant cells as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the internal surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
Manchester United signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the 40 million Po@@ und Sig@@ nature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pres@@ e@@ ason play before the UEF@@ A Super Cup ki@@ cked off against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira were mar@@ ching at will .
however , M@@ atic had been excluded from the blues @-@ Asia @-@ tour of the blues and only made 45 minutes to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks soccer , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him sooner than later be ready . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho started his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted three more new obligations , but he insisted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to meet three of its four priority new obligations .
&quot; three of four to get , I thank the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four from four for me , but they have taken great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner into the sky .
the pilots flew away from Seattle in the U.S. state Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US state Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
on the radar screens was the form of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new grav@@ estone for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
how the wind turns : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD leader , social democratic prime ministers were always looking for Berlin with a certain concern before elections .
but there was no fire from the party centre , but no head@@ wind from the Con@@ federation - that was the most important wish of the elec@@ tive fighters .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the staff from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House have been monitoring the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year is not even described in the approach with the head@@ wind .
there were deep@@ enings .
and one by one .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once again shows : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising resignation of a Green MP has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the Sunday elections , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from the CD@@ U and the F@@ DP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green @-@ Federal Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner asked El@@ ke T@@ ests to give back her mandate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transfer to the CD@@ U signi@@ fies a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate &apos;s will .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ ester must immediately restore her mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal Managing Director and election leader of the Green Party editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD leader si@@ gh@@ ed when the new hi@@ de@@ mic message reached the party centre on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , the SPD @-@ prime minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without its own government majority after the takeover of the green Euro MPs .
it is the preliminary cul@@ mination of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what is next .
the Mis@@ ers started with the un@@ expectedly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , not more , the comrades so@@ oth@@ ed .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
and it became even worse - and everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the di@@ ps , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ sh@@ te ble@@ w the party smoothly .
in the weeks afterwards , the comrades tra@@ vers@@ ed again .
then , when they had just kno@@ cked out new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg came .
and with him the next deep @-@ beat came .
mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD leader , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because in the crisis communication he made quite anything wrong , which one can do wrong .
since then Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival .
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Inves@@ tigation ( TV )
because of the VW exhaust air and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been critic@@ ised for quite some time .
other survey values were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , Wei@@ l tried to set accents in the Con@@ federation over the past few weeks .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin also did not remain secret in Martin Schulz &apos;s environment .
they allowed him to grant him a stabili@@ zation of the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could happen .
in doing so , Wei@@ l finds no fault in the party @-@ internal constra@@ int of the Anglo @-@ Saxon Gre@@ ens .
and Schulz is not at all .
for the time being , comrades try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed to the Gre@@ ens , and here , above all , the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arians of the T@@ owns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ arable and democratic as Mrs. T@@ owns puts her own career in the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the Party Left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ westen has not been elected for direct candidates because of her person , but on the land list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens , said the Lower Saxon parliament .
the logical consequence is that it res@@ ig@@ ns its mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , lam@@ ents an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a leading candidate in the federal election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U members fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he demanded clari@@ fication of the background .
I want to know if there has been more or more commitments from the CD@@ U Lower Saxony have given .
sponsor@@ ing funds for city centre III
anyone who wants to renov@@ ate his house in the years can soon get support from the country .
on top of that , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg Urban Development announced on Wednesday in emotion .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a look back on what has happened so far .
since 1991 , there have been some areas of rehabilitation .
at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two @-@ thirds of the funding amount .
in the area of rehabilitation from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still at 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the existing renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is important to further develop the inner development , and not only to open up new areas of construction .
on April 4 , the President of the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Karlsruhe obtained the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III .
the amount of funding amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500 000 euros from the country , the rest from the community feeling .
how does a remedi@@ ation area come into being ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; so sh@@ ing@@ ler is going to investigate where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether there is any interest in the planned area at all .
if necessary , the territorial limits could then move again .
the pi@@ er represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal state programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the restructuring would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the programme is the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , the improvement of living and working conditions and the preservation and expansion of the infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , that is , per plot .
the renovation area would then finally be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the grant period for funding has been running since January 1 , 2017 , until April 30 , 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year , however , it would be possible to take stock of the survey once again , as part of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire for filling out .
in November or December , it is planned to take place as soon as possible , so that the restoration can begin next year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then explained that every Commune had to carry out the above @-@ mentioned preliminary examinations .
the aim is to assess and to decide when and to what extent the urban development is to be evaluated and to decide when .
for the respective property there will also be a remedi@@ ation note written in the land register .
once again , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come back to sens@@ ations and get a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that the project was a key success factor for the project .
this is why there will be questionn@@ aires sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which deals with the structural condition and restoration views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; budget and housing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data on size , distribution and residents of a residential area can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rainbow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to fill out if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is important to note that a filled out questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not condu@@ ci@@ ve to fo@@ stering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler stressed that the distribution of funds after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funds for later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; renovation . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , has im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology by Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has partner@@ ed with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .
the technology is similar to a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks on homes and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional charge of £ 300 per castle .
the married father of one has now incorporated both at home and his BMW Z@@ 4 technology which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pa@@ yer thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month , costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military provided to the TI@@ ME magazine up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the cent@@ re@@ piece of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all over 50 countries .
the helicopter , manufactured in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , was exhibited in addition to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a Wis@@ con@@ sin fire engine and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House military bure@@ au called for the presence of helicop@@ ters in a frag@@ mentary order or cargo , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superior , the deputy military commander of aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the news showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long remained until the lawn between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 was cleared this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would need for the return flight .
the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the security staff of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the aircraft .
from the recordings provided by TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal states to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the determination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; replied the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was called the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave an impetus to reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One , from politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to use their use only for a photo op is unusual .
Tru@@ mp conducted an investigation in February , when the presidential plane was against the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of news that compla@@ ined about the use of the presidential jet by his predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which shows products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 occup@@ ations frequently carry out training flights in the Washington area and South La@@ wn to set the US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tru@@ mp was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 performed 58 exercises in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted at the training requirement of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
helicop@@ ters also flew 11 hours on that day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers took over the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokesman for Sik@@ or@@ sky said the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget@@ ary desig@@ nations for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the US Secretary of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft over 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers on the basis of estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ s@@ ements for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but also take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract completion .
at that time the former spokesman of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
it is of course appropriate to emphasize that . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine car .
in the White House , Tru@@ mp talked to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and talked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tricky task
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leader of the second tennis league took place in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; championship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the TC Blau @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the Tab@@ ellen@@ zimmer Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
despite five games still flaw@@ less , the leader of the second tennis league made sense for reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in a quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially at the back positions I find the team very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imports from the high North provide for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to the Davis Cup &apos;s bets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ er@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is as always hard for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser crew for the trip to the high North is convenient .
Maxim@@ e Jan@@ ez could give his debut for blue @-@ white .
while the competition in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ chman does not succeed in playing the Bundes@@ liga , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) played at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec ( Czech Republic ) for his first time in this season .
the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was on the ball yesterday with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ sky at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el .
he should be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories last Sunday against the club on the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ gar@@ z could again move into the team again .
if it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still the number one of the Junior World Ranking in January 2016 , someone from the train@@ ee around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay fills the cad@@ re .
how America can harm the O@@ MV
Donald Tru@@ mp was not really happy when he put his signature under the law to tigh@@ ten sanctions against Russia on Wednesday night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his hurry to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress had packaged a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he et@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Moscow reaction was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed the US offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft plans to punish European companies that will help the Russians build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors of O@@ MV are al@@ armed , which together with other European companies co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian East Sou@@ ls Nord Stream 2 .
the drug is enormous .
however , it is too early for an assessment of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp would have to raise the sanctions even per executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looked at what the group could oppose and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is moved into the spotlight in the series of Net@@ fli@@ x
in spite of the second season of Nar@@ co , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar Killer , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over .
the seasons three and four have already been confirmed by streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ ins of the show .
with the third season the DE@@ A has focused its attention on the world &apos;s most successful drug trade : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; led by four powerful sponsors , they operate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a For@@ tune 500 company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ az@@ ar ) is the leader of the Kart@@ ell , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican compound , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .
in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian prosec@@ uting authorities to support the war against drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ co will begin on September 1 .
R@@ ole Re@@ ward : the City represents 46 kitchen aids
the city re@@ organizes the K@@ ita lunch table itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the municipal kinder@@ gar@@ tens the clock is turned back .
on September 1 , the town of Kre@@ feld will take over food supplies in the city &apos;s day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
cooking is still out of house : a cat@@ erer takes care of this task and supplies fresh Gek@@ o@@ gens .
the town runs 46 children &apos;s day sites in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 children at lunch time receive a warm meal .
in the past Kit@@ a@@ Year , 28@@ 00 children were sitting at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are cared for by 45 hours of the week are in the day@@ time K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 14 : 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time employees have kitchen service from 1 September : they heat up the cooked food , add salad , raw food and fruit , divide the meal individually , give away food , clean off , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are permanently assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz .
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ line units - decides on the ho@@ ur@@ ly range .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now firmly attached to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for hosp@@ ital@@ isation to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also what it is about : healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare the food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known power in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleaning of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen forces - will be done by special cleaning personnel in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen capacity , also has the charm that it has found in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign exchange for the city as the most economical , it is from the press office .
and that , even though 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong with some 750 people in the education sector , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN .
elections can only be representative if all members of the Society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , senior director of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women will run in the provinces in the provinces . three women run for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credible if women fully participate and be involved in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections will take place on 5 April .
the Taliban have issued threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role .
this year the elections for the first time will pass the power peac@@ efully from a democrati@@ cally elected government to the next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ on said a strong role for women will increase the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afghan independent electoral commission reports that 1.2 million women were registered by a total of registered 3.@@ 6 million voters .

men try to eradic@@ ate 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to depri@@ ve a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
according to the police , the men told the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2.@@ 55 P.@@ M. because they wanted to phone with the girl &apos;s mobile phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request but continued with her friends .
after that , one of the perpetrators tried to attack the mobile phone and the necklace of the girl , which , however , was ab@@ used .
the duo fle@@ es without loo@@ t .
the two young men could later be arrested by the police .
the investigations run .
G@@ MB ap@@ pre@@ hen@@ sion on investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ dy@@ nasty factory in Glasgow
a trade union wants to make sure the long @-@ term commitment to production at its Glasgow factory in Glasgow , for managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company was silent about the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which is produced by other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea Kek@@ se .
in recent years Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in the past few years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the manager of the company G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s call on &quot; concerns that the financing for moderni@@ zing production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
G@@ MB Senior organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross affects our members .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers focus heavily on the local community and the Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and of chronic production decline , the Eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only yesterday received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will react directly to it as we value the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly .
we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , continually review our business - and that applies to all of our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility fully and entirely . if our operations are changing at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warned of Ne@@ ym@@ ar three years ago ?
the La Liga homepage may regret their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main is not rel@@ inqu@@ ished in its persecution of Ne@@ ym@@ ar after having given an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger his release clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years ago in front of the world record attack ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds .
after finishing , Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP a week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way Ne@@ ym@@ ar forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans board is insi@@ sting that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival in San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G President before this prospect ?
when Manchester City held an interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ i@@ fi had a severe warning for each club that wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ i@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to subscribe to one of our players , they will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish association expressed interest in the PS@@ G medium @-@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circum@@ stance , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offerings for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .
sco@@ oter tos@@ sed and damaged
in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown offen@@ ders intentionally revers@@ ed one in the Königs@@ felder Straße in front of the property No. 30 , and so on the fair@@ ing of the vehicle executed Saxon damage of more than 200 euros .

on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um was on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au on Thursday evening on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au on the way towards Le@@ ese .
in the area of the b@@ ypass of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him in his lane , so that he had to leave to the right .
the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the lead .

the driver of the forthcoming passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without wor@@ rying about the traffic accident .
according to the accident victims , it can be good that the car driver had not noticed the accident at all .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report rati@@ fies Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is what author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann writes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the final report on the abuse scandal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues to provide discussions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Wei@@ ghted , spokesman for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared by the former Regensburg bishop and today &apos;s Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology .
it would be very useful for the prestige of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their false evaluation of the processes at that time .
on the other hand , the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that in the reporting of violence against the dom@@ ites , &quot; two measures &quot; were measured .
regarding the ass@@ aults in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that it was &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; which would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation &quot; is striking , such as the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , Histori@@ ker@@ in and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ pi@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis also said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; you like to go to the church and this is a bon@@ ded fres@@ co . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put@@ ts a very normal educational tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cope with che@@ ek@@ y children as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would be unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to previous decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports of abuse , Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann writes , who auth@@ ored the &quot; Mein brother of the Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; I must take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he analyzes the results of the final report .
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber , who was commissioned by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence were applied .
especially in the case of high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the pupils could also be more severe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , contrary to numerous other alleg@@ ations , many victims estimated the general humanity of R. estimated and , in many cases , could even combine positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal is reli@@ eved by the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; is a contradictory picture of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
on the one hand , many students emphas@@ ise their &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , it appears also as a ch@@ oline and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became pal@@ p@@ able to the fore when a cathedral treas@@ ury didn &apos;t bring a top performance musically .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you make the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in it .
just eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or co @-@ knowledge in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school also ex@@ propri@@ ated outside its sphere of influence .
it is possible to blame him at all , to experience it too late or to have taken first hints seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was felt by virtually all those surv@@ eyed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , the vast majority of his student Georg R@@ atz@@ inger describes it as &quot; warm , &quot; &quot; popular , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , biscuits and candy , and &quot; always moved from the grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which also led to break@@ outs .
the fact that he didn &apos;t just grow@@ l up with chairs and threw the key on the ground , but also distributed ear che@@ ws and attracted too che@@ ek@@ y boys to the hair or ears , he himself has already admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for this .
for his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question of both parents and teachers in the present time , the 1960s and 1970s .
do you also know such cultivation methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us , who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state college .
compared to what is actually about in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school , these are tri@@ vial cases .
one wonders whether it is not more familiar with his acquain@@ tance and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI &apos;s brother , that many media fell on him straight .
many who have never understood him at the Bavarian pop@@ e are still working di@@ lig@@ ently .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , the report also reports a great deal about abuse on the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also some involvement or co @-@ knowledge with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to be entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the afflicted on behalf of the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing was very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse , however , is that most victims are silent .
if they didn &apos;t even confi@@ de to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then surely not a choir director , who would have been a colleague of the cul@@ pr@@ es professionally to a certain extent .
how do I evaluate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s R@@ atz@@ inger role with regard to the mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a questioned student put it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see any case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely re@@ aliz@@ ations and could have stopped the respective perpetr@@ ator .
I consider it ... even for really absurd , to assume that it was just for him ... to be more penet@@ r@@ able or clear or even more open than to their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , trust teachers , etc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that one talks to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report concludes with the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the students and / or their environment concerned before him could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus exemp@@ t from any co @-@ existence .
thus , it cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to an ad .
therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these vile crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media there was much to read from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence of violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former master @-@ master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
must he live with this repro@@ ach ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed in reporting to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the midst of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is precisely the mis@@ use of the report .
it is kept clean : between the pre @-@ school and the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence , we say , other repro@@ aches .
in addition , the report covers events from the period since 1945 , so also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the whole terrible test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were regularly har@@ assed and portrayed , and suffered irre@@ plac@@ ably , all took place at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions had to be ruled .
but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys first when they were already on the Dom@@ sp@@ litter @-@ gymn@@ asi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on this was , as most witnesses emphas@@ ise , the subject of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; primary school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one was only happy to be escaped and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heavenly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different on the gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in whom the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the most , the accus@@ ation remains to have looked away .
but despite all efforts the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and from his predec@@ essors at a school where he was not working and was responsible for ( such as the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then only around 1993 .
do Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently abandon the ears before the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ litter @-@ Gymnasium , which the report even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the pre @-@ school , the punishment will continue to be practiced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in the face of the danger of negative press releases he recommended urgent action .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed when test pun@@ ishments were banned in Bavaria too long ago .
before that they acquired themselves in a legal grey area , just as everyone of us knows .
it was difficult for him to assess where the suffer@@ ers were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed , and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
that &apos;s just not right .
it was only in 1980 that the test penalty in schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis asser@@ ted that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards to the time of that time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pit@@ fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the danger of assessing the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess has already been right .
but this is of course not true for sexual abuse , which at all times was disgu@@ sting and not for what was broken up in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls .
this is all quite dre@@ ad@@ ful and I am glad that it will finally be worked up .
but at the same time , I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipline and punishment , thus to draw ear @-@ arrows and to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then forbidden , it has kept strictly forbidden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what picture of his time ago Georg R@@ atz@@ inger played in the conversations with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject of testing also come to terms with the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells from his perspective , as the dom@@ ites played only a minor role .
nevertheless , I don &apos;t know that he led there a strict regi@@ ment there .
but even this must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g from the hitherto rather nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with cookies and candy alone , a rebel@@ li@@ ous boy does not have a great singer and can stand before any success , regardless of which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ sur@@ mounting .
what kind of person did you experience George R@@ atz@@ inger during the conversations with her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through work on the book and beyond , I really got to know George R@@ atz@@ inger thoroughly and again and again as mira@@ culous , humor@@ ous , gra@@ cious , deep @-@ believing and aff@@ ection@@ ate people , from which one can &apos;t imagine that he could do anything even a fly .
I regularly get in contact with him , like many former dom@@ cats today , 23 years after his em@@ iss@@ ance , visit him , visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family .
those who did not forgive him to this day , that he was once strict with them , are clearly in the minority .
today , most of the dom@@ ed cats are thankful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , sure , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect@@ ful person to which they still look up today and who are down@@ right hon@@ oring them .
and please , once again clearly : all that is presented to him are education methods that were on the order of the day at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can be happy that we have long since overcome this time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is most un@@ just , a man , only because he is promin@@ ently and has a more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intention behind it , only too obvious .
for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him .
now he would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great mer@@ its , and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany , nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
