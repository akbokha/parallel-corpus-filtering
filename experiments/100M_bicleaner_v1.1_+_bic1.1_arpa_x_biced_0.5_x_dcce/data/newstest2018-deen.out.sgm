<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irish institution, where young people today are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel, where now for the S-Bahn tunnel is dug.</seg>
<seg id="4">Farmers cultivate the former bottom of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Munich's oldest official map promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows it, which had to be exciting, because the Auto-Navi took a green meadow instead of a circumnavigation road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bayern of the State Government, are anything but current - but precisely because of this very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how towns and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich-based Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a carpet of tiles, which you can't recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">More detailed maps were incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities, so-called urine sheets.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were based on Bayerisches Vermessungsverwaltung from 1810 to 1864, and from the first surveyed surveyed in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops finally departed with the peace of Lunéville of 9 February 1801: it was the present neighbours who created the idea of a land-covering Bavaria-card.</seg>
<seg id="18">Elector Max IV Joseph further promoted the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian surveyed administration.</seg>
<seg id="19">The judging sheet for Munich dates from the year 1856 and is to be found in the Bayerische Landesbibliothek (Bavarian State Library) as any other.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison morning / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has grown in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is sendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was convened 21 years after the map was created, in 1877, as a Munich part of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today the sendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after George Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one can see nothing but fields - at first glance: in zooming a small-cut map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbers numbered from the so-called "uranium" from which the property tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots do not occupy more farmers there today - but small gardeners of the plant" "" "Land in Sonne" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of sendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">Theresienwiese, the site of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the area of today's district of Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "" "at the Gasteig" "" "or from the hill" "" "Auf der Lüften" "" "- but also in large letters" "" "Irren Anstalt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, people were once locked with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich district Irrenanstalt was created" "" "On the Auer Lüften" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Starting in 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - the psychiatrist, who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the so-called" "" "Irish" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he forbids the personnel to use violence against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients first place was first, and was expanded to 500 places later.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity wasn't sufficient anymore - the reason for the construction of the cirsirene facility in Haar 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-Amper-Klinikum in Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists since 2006, has been located there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in the Munich Salesianum are now meeting on the grounds of the former Augsburg prison.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football pitch of the TSV Munich East, east of residential houses from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015 the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was built - architecturally reminiscent of the original construction of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during World War II in bomb attacks." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "Main Square" "", "the shopping cart called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich too.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allied bombers tore many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A great remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days were the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn track.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the sliders, the old Munich-map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Ombudsman publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association to promote coloured people has issued a warning to coloured people who are travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory politics and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the Missouri state, which is to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls for afro-American travelers, visitors and Missouri to take special attention while travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents occur in recent times throughout the state and be noted here," stated in the group's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently approved Missouri law, which makes it difficult for people to win discrimination, as well as the state prosecuting authorities who disproportionately aim at minorities, prompted the group to issue travel warning, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights, which happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard before." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more fuel during the trip and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without accusing a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recently published report by the Office of the Missouri General Public Prosecutor, which is shown that black motorists in the state will stop 75 percent more frequently than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be prepared to bring their deposit money or let their relatives know they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri reported 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report program, which ranks the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it more difficult to sue a company because of housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the States had adopted immigration laws that local law enforcement authorities commit to arrest people on account of immigration violations, which will contribute to further racial profiling.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately interest groups have deployed the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">The fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weidejn Project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The members of the CDU and Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac provided a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the Court of Justice of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the CDU-village association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first granted insight into his farm in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, supplies 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodated in five apartments Feriengäste.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest milk" "" "is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengäste only regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also the BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the fence project as "vital importance."</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot produce profitably on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland care for a lot of work, much needs to be processed with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight with the conditions and topography here," "" "emphasised Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parent company and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not carry out bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the fence project and is happy with the support of leaders." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare the farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">"" "" "" "I hope that the reforestation of the land could be removed for quite a while." ""</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they will continue their operations," "" "said the Mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Because of funding, farmers often stand in criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The area of disclosure is therefore 40 hectares, which cannot be forested up to at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total costs of EUR 71 500, half of the leaders were promoted, one quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers kept 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the durability of the fences," Schwendemann explained.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and farmers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter Weiss:" "" "here the best foods are produced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Protection Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg is a state-of-the-art promotion of expansions.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to maintain the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The prerequisite is the presence of a conveying setting drawn by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the fenced area must not be sluggish (inclination over 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">The request of eight participants with 24 parcels, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway for the Fisherbach "Weidepleting Project 2018" project.</seg>
<seg id="96">The area of disclosure amounts to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as much as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdo Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN on the President's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitters would have told him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But it resorted to its importance, and in particular the importance that it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its base 17 years after the monument was completed.</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "as Miller Acosta," "" "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem that you refer to will be added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is factually correct, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state does not only invite some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, your oppressed masses, who yearn to breathe freely, and the miserable garbage of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable waste" "" "on our screens was better to see." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict around the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who sat down to place their words after their death on the base - knew very well that they took a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was to show links between French and American republicanism, depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical portrayal.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the Exilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus did change the importance of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great scream Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty did not invite anybody, but rather an early neo-conservationist who brings the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not enlighten the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative deed of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often horrible journeys on the deck of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever like to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not enlighten the way, but to ignite hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Cup 2017: Neil Black lodges Scottish Members of the Great Britain Team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"" "the performance director of the United Kingdom's athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the world championship header" "" "will make a massive contribution to the team." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017, starting on Friday.</seg>

<seg id="134">"" "" "" "I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think there is something to do with what they have done." ""</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butcher, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle is elected team captain by the team.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "Eilidh is quite modest." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">Their speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">"" "the passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best overall number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-distance runner Muir carries on this road and last year raised five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in 1500 m and 5,000 m races.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1500 m, is another Scotsman who was supposed to watch the victory at the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says they are "hugely proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also medals and finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"being so special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me, makes it something special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team." ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on platforms.</seg>
<seg id="155">As for my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to sit on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">"" "I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will simply be a great atmosphere out there." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="160">"" "" "" "block" "" "critics of Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the incitement of voters." ""</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers struck him for anything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He clasped with criticism, certainly.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not silenced his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "because in 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb we are led as sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 persons who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And this is why the American Civil Liberties Union accused him of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"" "the governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with" "" "Na, and?" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "it is only Facebook," "" "said many people." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary hot-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to play his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, blocking of people who come to the Governor's side - which is a public forum called officially and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the Governor and argued that blocking the comments is nothing but a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profound.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the commentary box of the news show "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I don't like this idea even if a number of people take a position on the same issue, they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the Governor's staff referred to as" "" "concentrated Spam attack" "" "would probably call another" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or being deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in previous times when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles or to arrest and silence demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticize Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue was in Virginia last week.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County passed the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banished a voter from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit to the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable porto had a similar effect as the internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter-pens proposed his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions criticized his position on the agreement of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain, overwhelmingly overpowered his ministry, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not put them into silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">Free speech, disagreement and discourses are based on our nation.</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means accepting that.</seg>

<seg id="440">One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce the emissions of Smog-causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the change as his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of the state's environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint, which was raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">"" "" "" "it is about a period running on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for Ozone." ""</seg>

<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was the Attorney General of Oklahoma before his appointment, was a reliable opponent of tougher environmental regulations for a long time.</seg>

<seg id="450">"" "" "" "under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for carrying out and then waited to set the deadline for implementation," "" "said Pruitt who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job." ""</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumour celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church will be invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30pm to a serenade.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historical St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth Benefiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and promoters of Tumblure their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">"" "Walter Martini stresses:" "" "it is a unique village jewel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in a documentary book in the Wuerttemberg primordial: "Graf Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the" Vogtei "at the Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the document, on the Hill of Tumlinger, besides the former parish church, there was also a beautiful courtyard, to which the church or the patronage belonged and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">There were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt from 1858, beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the village image of Tumour, the "mountain" of the third, the community centre of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Ancient maps dating from the period around the year 1600 reinforce these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and occupied with a priest still remained the owner of this church and was able to inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Associated with this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two digits at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were cut and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796, French troops were encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and the church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remnants of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the church was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Eve in 1834 a storm split up the church tower and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the present tower-tower today was preserved as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today, Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem take care of the "Schaffhauser Rentals" as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius installation.</seg>
<seg id="494">The organisers invite the friends and promoters of Tumblgens on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade on the old cemetery to St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>

<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheim Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, since at the time in Viersen, only at the border to Schwalmtal there was a wind force concentration zone.</seg>
<seg id="509">In this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are intended to prevent "convalescence" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">While the city of Viersen had already decided to change the land use plan a second wind power zone in the Boisheim Nette had been decided by a change in the land use plan - but it did not approve the Düsseldorf district government because of a mold failure.</seg>

<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a NEW subsidiary, plans to build four-metre-high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheim Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, has concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare site.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be met - this equates to roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-member households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen's city council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich Windpark near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind power plant in Übach-Palenberg in the district Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the financial rules of football on Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded issues of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Spain to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the executive organisation that oversees the European game has the power to forbid teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules launched by the UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG has to prove that the transfer from Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to extract the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make the money loose for Neymar to sign it and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the power rich family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs may spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but must counteract legitimate income sources that allow them to break the break-even point in their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini following his election to the UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that associations that had taken enormous debts in their quest for success effectively deceive and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentration on the debt of clubs to monitoring their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - a tougher issue.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three years of the FFP period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to deter from excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly increase the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount of invoice for the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the sum of redemption for the next five years amounted to EUR 44.4 million in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit PSG along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs who could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan company would sponsor the PSG, if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered to be a legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsored by Qatar Tourism Authority was inflated.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments by the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar have contested that Neymar World Cup ambassadors will become and such a maneuver for the UEFA regulators could be easy to figure out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG via Neymars Transfer, announced on Thursday the people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They talked about the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press since they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than €10 million with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year have to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars arrival a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and jersey sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers, on comprehensibility, motivation for use, and new user requirements, with a view to improving IAB's web presence even further.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymars departure by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the president of La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Katar's last owner to PSG." ""</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, shrunk from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I looked for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with them and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first inspection, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, plenty of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for joie.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">"" "" "" "Erfan had to think creatively in order to solve the requirement." ""</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steel work is quite complicated," "" "he explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not only a matter of building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and jars of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special feature of this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering art went inside," "" "explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is very important, so that when you push the door very easily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day, you will sell the land - or how your property will be appreciated," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious benefit.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things you touch and that help to create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you don't love the electrical power sockets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">"" "these are important, but they don't play with your heart." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself by a good design and an increased square metric number of some standard into something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, as Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute over one of the largest real estate imperialist Victorias worth more than 500 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets are to be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to retire from family business since 2014, but a sharp conflict over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family purchased a business in Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="1360">The Westco jeans family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail outlets.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate and the De LUTIS portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">"" "according to an agreement with her deceased father Colin - by Paul as" "" "principal operator and the dominant personality" "" "described in the De LUTIS family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third." ""</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The breakdown of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I considered for the best objects," "" "he wrote in 2015 in a first Affidavit." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The Brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, like Paul claims to have ruled him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but suggests Paul to administer some possessions incompetent.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early affidavit, which was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs increase, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both parties held law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs De LUTIS and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen stores from the late 1950s and bought a store in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood Property, in which Colin opened the first Jeansload of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he began Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De LUTIS says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to their sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," "" "she wrote." ""</seg>

<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De LUTIS and their lawyers.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps appointed new Chief of Staff to limit the president's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the White House Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more even course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"" "" "" "when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met on his first working day with senior officers, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House which he wanted to repair: poor information that was put into the hands of the President." ""</seg>
<seg id="1395">"" "Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relationship with television ranges decades back - and now, where he is in the White House, his television commercials are still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if Trump was annoyed because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were convincing," "" "said the former election adviser Sam Nunberg in February towards Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keeping Trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six former electoral campaigns, insists that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that Trumps Twitter habit was ever" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we don't know about others - that Trumps tweets would have made even more ignition without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about tweets that Trump did not send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his collaborators manage to keep annoyance from him several times, their efforts have paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has consistently prevented the fact that Trump has sparked controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">"" "" "" "POLITICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisers to supply the President for strategic reasons without questionable information." ""</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say that trump can react like a volcano on negative press cuts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that it turns out to find out where they originate." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">This was exactly what happened at the end of February when somebody was malicious a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh to "be the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson has been permanently banished from Twitter due to chicanes or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has voiced false allegations in the past and has revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started asking employees about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">"" "Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the general secretary of the White House, Rob Porter," "" "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.</seg>

<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is to be opened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Birkenhof Hotel through the then ambiente company company ltd. on April 13, 2014, approximately 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also revenue from the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In autumn 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees coming to the district, the hotel building was offered as a collective shelter, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious prospective buyers at the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should keep right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The Luisenhotels group with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">You will find Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The former Hotel Birkenhof has been standing for some time already before the entrance, and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renovations are done.</seg>
<seg id="1459">The floors have been torn out, ceilings partly decomposed, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single construction site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is a lot to do until March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a beautiful hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest Style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.</seg>

<seg id="1468">One does not want to be positioned at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an upscale downtown level, Scherer emphasizes.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread broadly, explains Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Individual vacationers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="1471">He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, so shaver.</seg>
<seg id="1472">The performances of the city were identical with those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">According to the level of investment, Thomas Scherer doesn't want to determine exactly.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Under one million euros, he reckons.</seg>
<seg id="1476">The external plants are also brought to the front man, which is already clearly visible.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia-Affair: us Special Investigator uses Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller was said to have deployed a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "in recent weeks, the committee has received the work, wrote the" "" "Wall Street Journal" "" "calling on people familiar with the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper evaluated the step as a sign that Mueller extended and intensified its investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The station CNN reported that there are already first invitations of the body in connection with a meeting between Trumps oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence services have blamed the Kremlin for a long time, purposefully interfered with the 2016 presidential election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller was investigating whether there were agreements between Trumps election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigations will focus on several men who acted as advisors to the Republicans in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller also scrutinised more and more Trumps in a private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote several weeks ago that the Sondererer Trump had personally put into the centre and investigates whether the President might have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to examine the present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether it should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">The Grand Jury is therefore also called the Prosecution.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Most of the time they are turned on when they are larger and controversial.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Board can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor to charge persons for hearing under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN station, charges have already been issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">Those who participated in the meeting had been asked for a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr., Trumps's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former election boss Paul Manafort were in the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the suspension shows that Mueller would not intimidate himself in his work and that if necessary, he wants to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">However, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the collection of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">However, the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to represent Russia's affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "the history of Russia is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "the issue gives the Democrats a chance to" "" "feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor Ty Cobb explained in a statement that he knew nothing about installing a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"" "" "" "but I'm usually working secretly," "" "he stressed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "the White House advocates all measures to expedite the work of the Special Agent in" "" "fair" "" "fashion." ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that he was not going to be determined against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">There is no reason to assume that something has changed, it was said in the statement.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller was only used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this expulsion, accusations against Trump had become louder, he wanted to impede the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1511">In June, Comey testified before a Senate committee, Trump asked him for an investigation against the former national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>

<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic iceberg drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the Westantarctic, a gigantic iceberg descended from the scarlet-shoe of the barely seven-fold size of Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was confirmed by the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener-Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The Koloss, which weighs about 1 trillion tons and 5800 square kilometres, dries northwards and will probably need two or three years until it melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that have registered in the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">It is not a danger for people.</seg>
<seg id="1524">The extent to which climate change has played a role in the decline of the iceberg is unclear according to research data.</seg>
<seg id="1525">On the whole, however, there have been a series of unusual breaks of ice-cuddiness in the region for some 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">So far the Koloss which has been broken down has been part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks off.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this horseshoe was disturbed by the balance of waxes and breaking-ups a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete coward was torn down there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger as the front edge has never been as far away as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the iron plate stands under tension and can fall apart, if a piece breaks at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of ice shelf and icebergs does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice creams as much water as it results after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could potentially raise the sea level, but only slightly, writes the British research project for observing the Antarctic (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth biggest ice shelf in Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the open ocean some 200 metres.</seg>
<seg id="1540">It regularly breaks off.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the record," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">"" "under scientists, whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will grow back or go back in the long term and possibly collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said," "" "Our models say that it will be less stable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers do not reverse the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many ice-coaters of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the research program of the British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up around three degrees in the past 50 years, counting on the areas where the temperature is the quickest.</seg>

<seg id="1563">The overall concept should orientate itself inwardly and externally, show concrete measures for cross-entry and involve an education campaign, demanding CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you did not know before.</seg>

<seg id="1582">Minnitis's warning came a day after Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German relief organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their crew had worked together effectively with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express himself in detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor of Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>

<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had monitored the boat from 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that the crew will take the dinghy migrants aboard, which will be delivered directly from traffickers, and that smugglers can turn off so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's acts, whose contents were published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The crew is suspected to override the authority of the Italian coastguard, which monitors the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa must above all have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities.</seg>

<seg id="1751">One day before Audi's announcement, BMW said that it would offer the software to update in more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The BMW Group said the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," and thus applied to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is located - to prohibit or restrict diesel vehicles.</seg>

<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the undertakings as a recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support the compliance of rules for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>

<seg id="1777">At times Mordillo was one of the most widely published cartoons, the nies of his characters are his trademark.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Also with 85 the Argentinean is still working on a film.</seg>
<seg id="1779">His message: laughter because there is too much suffering in the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist, he proposed himself as a drawer for greetings cards - what frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stops in Lima, New York and Paris he was able to make a breakthrough at the end of the 60's: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match," and then in the "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again, the artist was inspired by cities.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Large, roundish Mordillo figures are rocking in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1787">In the early morning, according to his own data, he still sits on the drawing table, working every day for almost ten hours.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Over calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, plush toys and watches, his droll figures continue to spread widely worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1789">He has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters for six years.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The main character in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos most popular animal in his drawings - which has a jack of thousands as a counterpart.</seg>

<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">Lavender is, due to the conditions reminiscent of drought and due to diseases transmitted diseases, which scientists and farmers are trying to find solutions causing great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, an expert in the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which in spring brought much less rain and in autumn much more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifetime of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"" "there is also a small chicade, a micro-bacterium that transfers dwarf-goats, and in very dry weather there are very many of them." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1802">Lavender oil not only attracts tourists, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the Weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure: they are supposed to take their children to the office, which in 2009 were the goal of an attack with grenades, or leaving them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, Allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary to submit perceptions and stomach feelings.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government's payroll or cartels, a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no break from violence, and while the bodies are piling up throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has been in office in December 2012. 589 after attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and her inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep though his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce Building. two reporters in the 1930's, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a special prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of murders connected every year with drug trafficking and organised crime, journalists are rarely tried by journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa although they are inconsolable and although the terrain is now more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">"" "" "" "without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefits," "" "says Ibarra." ""</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know why, we are all stranded." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "twelfth river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to move around freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country since rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that one or more people are shot in Sinaloa every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausoleums for drug kingdoms, which are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was crushed with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">At first there was in February the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, presumed gangsters bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was not to force Valdez, after requesting another newspaper, which had published the same story, to leave the country for its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to set up Riodoce and sold 50 US dollar holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without hitting the drug problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, sales and advertising.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters dared to publish hard-fitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to handle.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received prestigious "Maria-Moors Cabot Award" for her coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award for the protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." ""</seg>

<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun-bird, who curses like a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask," "" "Is his love for routine his destruction?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death has also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her job and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean businesses, their secret starting and runways," "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The anger is, the publisher of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened to Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, no mobile phones were allowed. days before it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-class neighbourhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in joke, some of the reporters questioned whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who the Governor described as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">"" "" "" "it is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto control." ""</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week, Riodoce has focused on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of brother of former well-known Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state expenditures focused on the city's hometown.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the office of the prosecutor, conducted a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug traffickers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), who ruled almost all the political planes throughout the century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-profile incidents of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"" "Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of" "" "El Chapo" "" "Guzman escaped a military attack." ""</seg>

<seg id="1886">Valdez's office became a storage space for signs and stickers that protest against the murders of journalists, because the staff have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>

<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez leaves Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since then asked her to be re-divided by the government because she is worried that her anger violated her objectivity.</seg>

<seg id="1942">The surprising preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armour over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It points to the fact that the dinosaur was hunted by meat eating dinosaurs, that evolution favoured the concealment of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of roe deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, which signalizes that this Nodose aurrier was subjected to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong predatory behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur carnivores must have been the chalk time," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about his life, including his condensed performer, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was as warm as southern fluorida today, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodose-rier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but remains in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early part of the circle." ""</seg>
<seg id="1954">"" "you don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you're just playing a little with your eyes, you might almost believe that it is asleep." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his furious ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mumified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he dug in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on 21 March 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the reserved armored dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that hung from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swamped by western Canada, until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater hull of the dinosaur kept its armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the cutest cover still bumpy tank plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as winning in the lotto.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I approach it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remains of the skin cover still the bumpy tank plates carrying the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His right front foot rests on his side, his five fingers are spread to the top.</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales at his sole. "</seg>

<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in the cinemas starting at the 11th.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and power of resistance stemming from the perspective of people living in the community and having filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell with her daughter, wearing a flower dress and a matching crown, drove to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that they had many times before this morning "about the black experience and the black condition."</seg>

<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter were joined by a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to protesters.</seg>

<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been splitting the population in proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>

<seg id="2094">While proponents build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, of which the rest of the shops also benefit, the opponents fear that then the pedestrian precinct is bleeding.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptibly similar - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst pressed a 35-year prison sentence after being classified as secret diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on August 2, is called a Becoming Stresemblance (a matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combines her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and a groundbreaking dissident whose sentence was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by algorithmic analysis of the DNA that could be extracted by Manning and created out of the 30 portraits, as someone with these genomic data could look, a sharp, though some intellectual comment not just about the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the law of espionage, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Her picture was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie in which Manning visibly sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came just from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce an image of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"" "" "" "they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "" "explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition." ""</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she couldn't attend this time and she couldn't be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a portrait of a DNA.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal spectacles, which in the course of two years exchanged several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"" "they even created a comic illustrated by Shoili Kanungo" "" "Suppressed Images" "", "which foresaw a future in which the President of Chelsea would convert judgment and it would be able to see the exhibition personally." ""</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome type of happy coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump performs a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender forces in order to find new, tweetable ways to inflame the rigid divisions that he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a particular reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery, Manning called with her oversized signature (the "i" in her surname is marked with a heart) an end to "automatic fragmentation, whose foundation sex, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandfold of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), as surprisingly similar, at least in biological respect, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"" "" "" "what people hopefully will take with them is that our genome will not take care of who we are and how openly genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective they are," "" "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also visible." ""</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2159">A nationwide human-hunt is in progress for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University, who are looked after as suspects after a man had been stabbed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injury.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday for murder of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued arrest warrants on the basis of murder of Cook County's County Court.</seg>
<seg id="2161">The documents tell that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A common warning system published by the Chicago Police Department is that the corpse was discovered on July 27.</seg>

<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead in the place of events, and detectives investigating the stitches as murder, while the police actively seek the two suspects said officials.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Since 2007, Lathem has been Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University.</seg>

<seg id="2181">Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).</seg>

<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of WADA's roadmap to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re-establishing RUSADA and was recently published on the organization's website.</seg>

<seg id="2187">"" "and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," "" "he added." ""</seg>
<seg id="2188">One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, states that the Russian anti-doping authorities have to publicly accept the results of the examination approved by the WADA by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sports.</seg>

<seg id="2192">Mutko's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the leader of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.</seg>
<seg id="2193">Talking to the Russian sales outlet at the beginning of the day, Smirnov agreed to problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but added: "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2194">"" "no one has proposed to accept this report unconditionally," "" "added Smirnov." ""</seg>
<seg id="2195">In November 2015, RUSADA was excluded from the WADA by conducting doping control in Russia in the course of doping scandals.</seg>
<seg id="2196">However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).</seg>
<seg id="2197">After a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow organization in July, WADA Director, Olivier Niggli, declared that RUSADA is moving in the right direction in order to be used again.</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure happiness with your e-commerce start-up, but the polls did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - deceitful.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.</seg>

<seg id="2208">It has called people from outside to help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is at the waxing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to perform surveys, offer special groups and demographic groups, employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases Whistleblowers permit to circumvent the C-suite executives and address directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>

<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap Polls and Polls of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows which units have most complaints and which executives have low approval outcomes - so you can reboot, why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that they have to stay at the forefront of workplace culture so that you do not become the next Uber, who has been involved in scandals, since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as GLINT this wish is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance sector could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the financial website of Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Converter has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">He has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like GLINT, Convercent allows companies to send tailored "Puls-" Polls, collect sensitive answers in real-time, and view the heat cards of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline, which allows employees to report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "public opinion has included regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that treats its employees poorly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences by consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has appointed Convercent for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Previously, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel who said there was no good way to prosecute the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the Enterprise Convercent uses, problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed more quickly - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience with employment," "" "said Vitrano, who leads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment litigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take Ethics, Values and Employee Engagement in 2002, after Arthur Andersen's accounting firm collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies recognized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Convercent offer their software as a service, and debit the companies with recurring charges for using their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">In February Convercent received $10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the total capital was raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">A total of $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners secured his entire funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing research complex that shows that today's employees are expecting more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The staff want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"" "" "" "if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their votes, and that the work that you do is worth it, then feel stronger to make this company successful," "" "said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn who uses both Convercent and GLINT." ""</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach returns when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">When the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">Data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the caretaker of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks staff about your feedback, it can have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come fast enough or not at all, this can breed disappointments and demotify employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"" "" "" "if you ask about 4,000 suggestions, you must be prepared to have 4,000 talks," "" "said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the business management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that rely too much on collecting data." ""</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you do not follow the staff," "" "Have you really heard me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "and if you don't care about why should I?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem related to GLINT is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize multiple teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights on the employees, and it hopes that in the long term, this leads to a better bond of workers in an industry known for high turnover.</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-ies and 1980-s.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his comfortable seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and now has become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire mophaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes which is based on an archive: it wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>

<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access only in 2006, when the last heirs, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>

<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to sink into English history, among them 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of an uproar that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled" Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex, "Rhodes says.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it could not be even more crazy in 2017, a new report about technological developments in the area of sex robots will come.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotik) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them and we will see them much more often," "" "said Mr. Sharkey at the publication of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern expusions have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can" "" "adjust" "" "his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots have the" "" "personalities" "" "that would make a stepford woman look progressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern expupping have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot allows users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot developed by True Companion using pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible," "" "enthuses the website of True Companion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can" "" "be in mood" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step to frigid (i.e., resisting) Farrah, restless one most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy has a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men have no Roxxxy?" "" "it says on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">But these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their origins and their increasing sophistication point to somewhat darker and deeper into our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notices its increasing popularity, they still remain on the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what transpires out of the marginal zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly evolved sex robots are appearing in a time when the rights of women are threatened all over the world in which there is a president in the White House, who has promised to have women sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the handmaid ') are not the graphic images, the swallowed body and the pounding eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to real women as realistically as possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots pose no real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot be separated from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background story, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the fantasy of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are counterfeit slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to put it in the Redemption of 2017: maid girls</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney an epitome of common sense</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a truce of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. electorate, have also split families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving Day there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump's relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all trying to make our filter bubbles burst.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trumps to bring together families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-right poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with the republicans in our family for a long time, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone whom she knows, including the republican kinship, with which she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and wholly strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table that is certainly a good thing, but it falls to me in a further context that this also brings significant risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we speak of" "" "normalization" "" "and" "" "Trump" "", "we refer to the cruelly possibility that his kittens will not be repelled one day." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">But there is still a more frightening long-term scenario, in which Trump republicans the right wing "normalized," which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison with its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I think of an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax returns) - both in comparison to Trump are indeed a very mild crime.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must only be mentally healthy in order to qualify as immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels of the New York Parks Department, and the top three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crunchy and the animals twist to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate-permitting music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines are too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the topic pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not counting - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience, as here two two-year-old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s can walk on it and have all a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street, it is the same, plus the option to pay the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This does not only result in a slowdown of what is actually a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store stood apologetically grinsing while I was tired of making her my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital</seg>

<seg id="2452">On the occasion of murder, Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence by an appeal by the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013, firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder who hid himself in the cabin.</seg>

<seg id="2540">At the same time, he is surprised that no application has yet been applied to the requirement profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">So - considering the regular notice periods - should still be enough time for a familiarisation.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach works for the Administrative Community as Lower building rights authority, the applicant must show appropriate degrees.</seg>

<seg id="2556">"you can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors.</seg>
<seg id="2557">Since the oldtown is listed as an ensemble under monument protection, it is important to "have an eye on what fits in" when new buildings are approved, emphasises the outgoing town builder.</seg>
<seg id="2558">In any case, the Stadtbaumeister bears high responsibility.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study says exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affecting approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United States causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrolling in the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in the food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have shown that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell in mice occurs that carry a specific bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal portion of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"" "the more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2591">It suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system also swirls in people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Post-doctoral researcher Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was separated, did not have this.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi which normally live in the gastro-intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of the mice were sequenced and six bacterial species were found that were present in mice with immune cells, but without them in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were taken up in a sterile environment so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received L. reuteri and immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how bacteria acted to the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri were able to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells that were isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as Indol-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the internal surface of the intestine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">"" "potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2673">On top of that, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of Steg Urban Development announced on Wednesday in emotion.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a look back on what has happened so far.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991, there have been some areas of rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="2676">At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land of Baden-Württemberg took over two-thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the area of rehabilitation from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still at 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the existing renovations are a "success project" - it is important to further develop the inner development, and not only to open up new areas of construction.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, the President of the Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe obtained the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The amount of funding amounts to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros from the country, the rest from the community feeling.</seg>

<seg id="2686">"" "Keller presented the contents of the federal state programme" "" "Social City" "", "in which the restructuring would then be carried out." ""</seg>
<seg id="2687">The core of the programme is the revitalization of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the preservation and expansion of the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be carried out object-related, that is, per plot.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The renovation area would then finally be defined as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The grant period for funding has been running since January 1, 2017, until April 30, 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">However, until September this year, however, it would be possible to take stock of the survey once again, as part of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire for filling out.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, it is planned to take place as soon as possible, so that the restoration can begin next year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann then explained that every Commune had to carry out the above-mentioned preliminary examinations.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would need for the return flight.</seg>

<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain is not relinquished in its persecution of Neymar after having given an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but have they warned Barcelona three years ago in front of the world record attack?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds.</seg>

<seg id="2869">But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG President before this prospect?</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report on the misuse cases relieves Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann writes.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "the final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to provide discussions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weighted, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," declared by the former Regensburg bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be very useful for the prestige of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their false evaluation of the processes at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2894">On the other hand, the Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised that in the reporting of violence against the domites, "two measures" were measured.</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the assaults in Regensburg, no one doubted that it was "shameful and shameful acts" which would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, such as the author Lucetta Scaraffia, Historikerin and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scarpiia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "you like to go to the church and this is a bonded fresco."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that in her youth" "" "putts a very normal educational tool" "" "had been" "" "to cope with cheeky children as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">It would be unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports of abuse, Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann writes, who authored the "Mein brother of the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take care of Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he analyzes the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, who was commissioned by the diocese of Regensburg?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, 547 Regensburger Domspatzen was" "" "with high plausibility" "" "victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is called Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases, forms of physical and psychological violence were applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially in the case of high emotionality, the punishment for the pupils could also be more severe.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "nevertheless, contrary to numerous other allegations, many victims estimated the general humanity of R. estimated and, in many cases, could even combine positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal is relieved by the Regensburger Domspatzen-Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence in the Regensburger Domspatzen," is a contradictory picture of Georg Ratzinger's Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2910">On the one hand, many students emphasise their "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it appears also as a choline and perfectionist, which became palpable to the fore when a cathedral treasury didn't bring a top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you make the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Just eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or co-knowledge in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the pre-school also expropriated outside its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">It is possible to blame him at all, to experience it too late or to have taken first hints seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was felt by virtually all those surveyed as" "" "redemption," "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">For example, the vast majority of his student Georg Ratzinger describes it as "warm," "popular," "sincere," "honest," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy, and "always moved from the grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to breakouts.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he didn't just growl up with chairs and threw the key on the ground, but also distributed ear chews and attracted too cheeky boys to the hair or ears, he himself has already admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for this.</seg>
<seg id="2921">For his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question of both parents and teachers in the present time, the 1960s and 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such cultivation methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us, who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state college.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually about in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the pre-school, these are trivial cases.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it is not more familiar with his acquaintance and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI's brother, that many media fell on him straight.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many who have never understood him at the Bavarian pope are still working diligently.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"" "" "" "in the media, the report also reports a great deal about abuse on the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also some involvement or co-knowledge with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to be entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "" "said one of the afflicted on behalf of the others," "" "Everything was very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in educating sexual abuse, however, is that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they didn't even confide to parents and siblings, then surely not a choir director, who would have been a colleague of the culpres professionally to a certain extent.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do I evaluate Ratzinger's Ratzinger role with regard to the misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questioned student put it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see any case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely realizations and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... even for really absurd, to assume that it was just for him... to be more penetrable or clear or even more open than to their parents, dormitory managers, trust teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">"" "that one talks to him about sex... - unthinkable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report concludes with the very clear result:" "" "the students and / or their environment concerned before him could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus exempt from any co-existence.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus, it cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to an ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these vile crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media there was much to read from" "" "violence of violence" "" "at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former master-master Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "looking away" "" "in the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Must he live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed in reporting to a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the midst of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is precisely the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">It is kept clean: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, we say, other reproaches.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report covers events from the period since 1945, so also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir director of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were regularly harassed and portrayed, and suffered irreplacably, all took place at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions had to be ruled.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys first when they were already on the Domsplitter-gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on this was, as most witnesses emphasise, the subject of" "" "primary school" "" "taboo." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">"" "one was only happy to be escaped and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even" "" "heavenly" "" "states." ""</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in whom the report concludes that" "" "many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">At the most, the accusation remains to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and from his predecessors at a school where he was not working and was responsible for (such as the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then only around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Do Georg Ratzinger consistently abandon the ears before the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domsplitter-Gymnasium, which the report even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out that" "" "in the pre-school, the punishment will continue to be practiced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Even in the face of the danger of negative press releases he recommended urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed when test punishments were banned in Bavaria too long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that they acquired themselves in a legal grey area, just as everyone of us knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to assess where the sufferers were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized, and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That's just not right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">It was only in 1980 that the test penalty in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis asserted that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time of that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the" "" "pitfall of anachronism" "", "the danger of assessing the past according to today's moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is of course not true for sexual abuse, which at all times was disgusting and not for what was broken up in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all quite dreadful and I am glad that it will finally be worked up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of discipline and punishment, thus to draw ear-arrows and to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then forbidden, it has kept strictly forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what picture of his time ago Georg Ratzinger played in the conversations with you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of testing also come to terms with the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, as the domites played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I don't know that he led there a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang from the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With cookies and candy alone, a rebellious boy does not have a great singer and can stand before any success, regardless of which area, but always discipline, passion and self-surmounting.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person did you experience George Ratzinger during the conversations with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through work on the book and beyond, I really got to know George Ratzinger thoroughly and again and again as miraculous, humorous, gracious, deep-believing and affectionate people, from which one can't imagine that he could do anything even a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get in contact with him, like many former domcats today, 23 years after his emissance, visit him, visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who did not forgive him to this day, that he was once strict with them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Today, most of the domed cats are thankful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, sure, that may be - but also a lovable respectful person to which they still look up today and who are downright honoring them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clearly: all that is presented to him are education methods that were on the order of the day at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"" "" "" "we can be happy that we have long since overcome this time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unjust, a man, only because he is prominently and has a more prominent brother to make the medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intention behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which was just published, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now he would command a 93-year-old man who acquired great merits, and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany, nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
